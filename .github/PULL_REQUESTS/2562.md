# Add missing IAM Permissions s3:PutBucketOwnershipControls to docs

**klaphi** commented *May 11, 2023*

Starting with terragrunt version v0.45.4 bucket ownership controls has been introduced. The IAM policies provided in in the docs does not have the required permission s3:PutBucketOwnershipControls, which is needed according to the [aws-docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-ownership-new-bucket.html). With the current policy all fresh deployments with terragrunt that use the mentioned version or a version above will fail because of not enough permissions.

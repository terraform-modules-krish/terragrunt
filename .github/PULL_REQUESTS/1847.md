# #1845 Passing of include configuration during IAM role evaluation

**denis256** commented *Oct 5, 2021*

Updated `setIAMRole` to pass include configuration during the evaluation of HCL code to have the same behaviour as evaluation of all HCL blocks

Example, repo  https://github.com/denis256/terragrunt-test-1845, directory `test/test1/test2`

before change:
```
$ terragrunt version --terragrunt-log-level trace
...
path_relative_to_inclue: test/test1/test2
path_relative_to_inclue: . 
...
```

after change:
```
$ terragrunt version --terragrunt-log-level trace
...
path_relative_to_inclue: test/test1/test2
...
```

Fix for: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1845

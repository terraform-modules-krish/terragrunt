# Change how Terragrunt downloads remote Terraform configurations

**brikis98** commented *Jul 8, 2018*

1. Instead of downloading configurations into a temp dir, download remote configurations into `.terragrunt-cache` in the working directory. This makes it easier to understand what Terragrunt is doing, debug issues, and recover state files if something went wrong (e.g., lost Internet connectivity). I've also added a `--terragrunt-download-dir` option that can be used to override the download dir. Fixes #513 and #151.

1. Check for empty Terraform folders as part of the Terragrunt workflow. This avoids confusing error messages. Fixes #163.

1. When using `terraform init -from-module=xxx` to download remote configurations from `xxx`, set `-get=false`, `-backend=false`, and `-get-plugins=false`. We already have code that runs `terraform init` if any of those are missing, so disabling it on the first pass should save a second check, and improve iteration speed. Note that Terraform has some extra validation behavior it does if `xxx` does not have a double-slash, which causes errors if `-get=false` is set. To work around this, I've updated the code to always behave as if a double-slash is present. Fixes #279.

@brikis98 is there a solution for users that depended on Terragrunt configuring the backend for them, having the `-backend=false` at https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/7c84de5ee791b430150e8a05e7894fa3b23d9bd9/cli/cli_app.go#L508  means now you need to do it separatedly of the Terragrunt run?

I wanted to grab the `.terragrunt-cache` feature, but updating to this version broke what I had with 0.14.0 , so I'll keep using 0.14.0 for now.

My `terraform.tfvars` looks like this:

```
terragrunt {
  terraform {
    source = "git::ssh://git@git.corporate.com/ou/repo.git//?ref=branch"
  }
  remote_state {
    backend = "s3"
    config {
      bucket         = "abucket"
      dynamodb_table = "terraform"
      encrypt        = true
      key            = "akey"
      region         = "us-east-1"
    }
  }
}
// bunch of vars
```

And, I have this, that worked with 0.14.0, as you would expect.

```
terragrunt state --terragrunt-source-update --terragrunt-non-interactive rm module.amodule.aws_ecs_task_definition.ataskdef
```

`ataskdef` has a lifecycle that prevents destroy, I want it removed from the state before starting (I really don't want to lose this resource), I create a new one every time (this is my rollback strategy to a previous `taskdef` BTW).

But this exact same thing in 0.16.2 fails with the infamous #214 , (Reason: Initial configuration of the requested backend "s3")

So, what to do? I can't think of any migration path to 0.16.2.

Hm, that shouldn't be the case. Terragrunt calls `init` twice:

1. Once with the `-from-module` param to download the code you specify in the `source` parameter. This is where we set `-backend=false`.

1. Once later on if Terragrunt determines your backend configuration needs initialization or modules need downloading. Here, we do not set `-backend=false`. 

Is this not what you're seeing?

@brikis98 I have noted something, this happens when `git::ssh://git@git.corporate.com/ou/repo.git//?ref=branch` have a Terraform module which source is remote. (git).

Not sure I follow? We use SSH URLs with all of our Terragrunt modules and it initializes the `backend` for us automatically. Do you have a `backend "s3" { ... }` block in your Terraform code?
***

**andresvia** commented *Jul 13, 2018*

I do. My module is also referencing external modules, so, the initial init is not getting those external modules.

**andresvia** commented *Jul 13, 2018*

Do you follow me? My "Terraform code", apart from having `backend "s3" { ... }` resources and "relative" modules, also have "remote" modules `module { source = "git@..." }` modules, I think the later are not being downloaded by the "initial" init.

Yea, I understand you, but I can't repro it, as we do the same thing and it works fine ðŸ˜• 

E.g., I have a `terraform.tfvars` with:

```hcl
terragrunt = {
   terraform {
     source = "git::ssh://git@github.com/gruntwork-io/infrastructure-modules.git//foo/bar?ref=v0.0.1"
   }
 }
```

The `bar` module contains code like this:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
   region = "us-east-1"
 }
 
 terraform {
   backend "s3" {}
 }

 module "foo" {
   source = "git::git@github.com:gruntwork-io/module-foo.git//modules/bar?ref=v0.5.1"
 }
```

I run `terragrunt apply` and see output like this (edited/truncated for readability):

```

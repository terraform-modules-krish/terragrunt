# Update regex that checks Terraform version compat

**luis-silva** commented *May 3, 2017*

This PR is meant to fix #200 as well as to provide the functionality to run user compiled terraform binaries e.g. when fixing terraform bugs or adding extra functionality locally and before it is merged into the mainline terraform codebase.

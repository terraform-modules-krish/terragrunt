Thanks for review! Prior to merge, I want one sanity check from @brikis98 on the terminology of the new feature: does `include_in_copy` make sense? I got that off [your comment for the inverse](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/394#issuecomment-350758961). I can't come up with anything better, but the one thing that bothers me about it is that it isn't obvious that this configuration only exists for local file terraform sources - it doesn't apply to git sources - so wondering if you had a better suggestion here.

Thanks for review! I'm going to merge this in now, and open a follow up PR with the suggested changes from @rhoboat (to avoid another review cycle).

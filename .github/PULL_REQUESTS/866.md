#  Fix bug where the context for running terraform output on the child was incorrect

**yorinasub17** commented *Sep 16, 2019*

This fixes the bug reported in https://community.gruntwork.io/t/backend-local-outputs-not-found/341

The main issue was that `terragruntOptions.Clone` doesn't update the `DownloadDir` to be in the context of the dependency config. This causes problems when using local state, as the state is stored in the terragrunt download directory.

Trying to compile this, with `go get` on your checked out branch, I did run into #822. Removing `hashicorp/terraform/vendor/github.com/zclconf/go-cty` allowed me to continue compiling.

Using the resulting binary after compilation fixes my reported problem on the community site. Thanks @yorinasub17.

# Log terragrunt output to stderr

**bshelton229** commented *Jan 8, 2017*

Logging to stderr is a potential solution for #24. We alias `terraform -> terragrunt` everywhere to avoid any mistakes (we love terragrunt) and would like to still be able to rely on piping and reading from terraform's stdout.

This should fix commands like `terragrunt graph | dot -Tpng > mygraph.png` and allow reading json from stdout from commands like `terragrunt output -json | json "my-key.my-value"`.

I also wouldn't mind helping with a `-silent` flag if that is a preferred approach, or something that could be implemented as well as writing terragrunt output to stderr.

Oh, good call. I think this even fits better with the purpose of stdout/stderr. That is, stdout is for the actual output of the program (in this case, the output of Terraform itself) and stderr is for diagnostic info, errors, etc (such as what Terragrunt is logging). 

Thanks!

I just created a new release here: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.8.0. If the build passes, the new binaries should be there in a few minutes.

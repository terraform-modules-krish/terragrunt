# ~ aws-auth docs - iam remove object level actions from the bucket resource

**Kiran01bm** commented *Apr 17, 2023*

## Description

Fixes #2532.

The [AWS Auth Docs here ](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/aws-auth/#aws-iam-policies) refers to a couple of s3 object level actions (SID: `AllowCreateAndListS3ActionsOnSpecifiedTerragruntBucket`) on the bucket resource which seems incorrect and is fixed in this PR.

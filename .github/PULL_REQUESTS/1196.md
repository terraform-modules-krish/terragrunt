# Partial parse version checks

**yorinasub17** commented *May 23, 2020*

This improves on the recent version check functionalities that were added by leveraging partial parsing. This is especially useful for the  `terragrunt_version_constraint` functionality that was added in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1192 .

Specifically, this will now error out with the version error message, instead of a parsing error when using an incompatible terragrunt version.

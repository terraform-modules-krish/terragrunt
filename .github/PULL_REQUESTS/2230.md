## Description

Fixes https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1973

This updates the `run-all render-json` command to output the rendered json for each `terragrunt.hcl` file adjacent to the config file (in the same directory).

## Release Notes (draft)

<!-- One-line description of the PR that can be included in the final release notes. -->
- Fixed a bug in `render-json` where when running with `run-all`, it reuses the same rendered json file for all runs, causing a race condition where the last module to run always wins. Now the rendered json output is created adjacent to each `terragrunt.hcl` config `terragrunt` finds.

> Make sense to add an integration test? to track that terragrunt_rendered.json will be created in the right place

Make sense! Just added one in [5267d65](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/2230/commits/5267d65cf2ef6bbe99a9ba2c5db63f2592794225)

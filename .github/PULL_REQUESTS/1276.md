# Only parse terraform source during stack generation

**yorinasub17** commented *Jul 31, 2020*

Fixes #992

This updates the partial parsing step during module stack generation to only parse the terraform source and ignore the other blocks/attributes. This allows usage of `dependency` references in the sub blocks of the `terraform` block, but not the `source`.

Thanks for review! Merging this in now.

guys, sorry to bring this back to life again but I was trying to use a dependency into the source part, and it was working with a regular plan|apply, but not with a `run-all`.

So ended up here, noticed this has been fixed for everything in the `terraform` block, except for `source`.

I assume there is (or was) a good reason that this was not possible for the `source`, is this still valid?

Or is there an opportunity to allow for `source` now as well?

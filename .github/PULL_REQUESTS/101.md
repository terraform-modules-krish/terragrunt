# Read remote state file from specified working dir

**asobrien** commented *Jan 15, 2017*

This changes `shouldConfigureRemoteState` in `remote_state.go` to always pass the `WorkingDir` option to `ParseTerraformStateFileFromLocation` in `terraform_state_file.go`. If `--terragrunt-working-dir` is specified the path to state files in that working dir should always take precedence over `DEFAULT_PATH_TO_LOCAL_STATE_FILE` and `DEFAULT_PATH_TO_REMOTE_STATE_FILE`.

Fixes #95.

I was concerned about the case of the `workingDir` not existing, but that's handled gracefully downstream by `ParseTerraformStateFile` in any case. 

@brikis98 042ae90 reverts this back to the original structure if/else-if/else structure.

Just created a new release here: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.9.2. If the build passes, the binaries should show up in a few minutes.

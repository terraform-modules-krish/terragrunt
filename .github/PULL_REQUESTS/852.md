# RFC Template

**yorinasub17** commented *Sep 5, 2019*

This proposes a new practice of writing RFCs for proposing reasonably complex Terragrunt features that may be difficult to capture in a single Github Issue.

This PR includes:

- Update to the Contribution guideline to mention RFC practice.
- A template that future RFCs can use. This ensures a standardization of the format and makes sure all the information we expect from RFCs are included.

Merging this in. Thanks for the review! Will use the template to write up the RFC for the iteration feature.

# Improve the global behaviour of -all commands

**jocgir** commented *Apr 28, 2017*

The output of -all command could be very difficult to read. I modified several files to implement a new mechanism and improve the global readability.

I think that this implementation could help for #80. However, I did not implemented a summary for apply-all and destroy-all. It works very well with output-all and plan-all. And the same technique could easily be applied to summarize apply-all and destroy-all.

It works especially well when we redirect the stderr to /dev/null. The output of the distinct terraform command are then grouped together and easier to associate with the source module.

Since the addition of the new remote state, a lot of output related to the terraform init are displayed. I changed the behaviour to only display this output if there is a problem.

I also refactored the newly added plan-all to implement a summary at the end and also support correctly the -detailed-exitcode option from terraform.

Finally, this new implementation should solve the problem #198.

@brikis98 I had to merge #201 in this PR because I was not able to test it. Normally I develop on osx, but this weekend, I am on Windows. And also, the whole redirect thing was not working properly with the current implementation of `runShellCommandAndCaptureOutput()`. It caused a lost of error output when there are errors on redirected commands.

The output looks pretty nice!

Also, all this new behavior will need some tests.

**jocgir** commented *Apr 30, 2017*

Any idea of tests? In fact, there is not a lot of new behaviour. It is just a reorganization of how we process what is already existing...

Well, as a first step, we should make sure the existing tests are passing :)

I'll leave some comments in the code with ideas for other tests.

@jocgir Let me know what's the status with this PR.

**jocgir** commented *May 29, 2017*

Sorry, lack of time.

One of my colleague is supposed to write the tests to complete this PR.

Can we get an update on this? `plan-all/apply-all` swallowing errors really sucks 😢

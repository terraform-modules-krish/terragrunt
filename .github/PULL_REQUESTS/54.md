# Ensure Terragrunt picks up changes to remote config

**brikis98** commented *Nov 22, 2016*

This PR fixes #15. Terragrunt now compares all settings of the remote configuration between what’s stored in the `.tfstate` file and in `.terragrunt`. If any of those settings don’t match up, it prompts the user whether it should re-run `terraform remote config`.

To make this code testable, I’ve also added a new `--terragrunt-non-interactive` flag that can be used to disable user prompts when running Terragrunt in an automated setting (e.g. in an automated test or script).

@josh-padnick I'm going to merge this one in to unblock myself for a few more PRs. Feedback welcome when you have time.

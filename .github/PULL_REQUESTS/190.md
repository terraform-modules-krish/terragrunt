# Fix how we execute Terraform commands so stdout isn't dirtied with unrelated output

**brikis98** commented *Apr 25, 2017*

When you run a single `terragrunt` command, under the hood, Terragrunt may execute several `terraform` commands. For example, when you run `terragrunt apply`, Terragrunt may run `terraform init`, `terraform get`, and finally, `terraform apply`. 

Only the original Terraform command should log to `stdout`. All other commands should log to `stderr`. We already have this logic in the `shell` package, but due to some dumb usage of cloning the `TerragruntOptions` object, we accidentally worked around this logic. This PR should fix that.

Thanks for the contribution! The use case makes sense, but as you mentioned, this implementation isn't quite there yet.

That said, I believe this use case is covered by https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1137 which we intend to complete in the near future. Does the proposed solution in that PR cover your needs?

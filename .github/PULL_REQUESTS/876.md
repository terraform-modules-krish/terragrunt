# Dynamo db localendpoint

**mattiarossi** commented *Sep 23, 2019*

Terraform v0.11 added the possibility to specify a custom dynamodb endpoint for the dynamodb locking table.
This PR adds support for the configuration parameter in terragrunt as well.
This allows to use either a custom endpoint, different from the standard aws one, or to deploy a local dynamodb instance for cases where access to AWS infrastructure is not posible/allowed

I didn't create a specific unit test as no equivalent exists

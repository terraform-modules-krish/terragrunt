# Fix panic when S3 Bucket Versioning is not enabled.

**josh-padnick** commented *Dec 5, 2016*

Fixes #65. My guess is that this is a bug with the AWS SDK for Golang since the interface seems to allow checking a `Status` field, but in practice this field is `nil` unless S3 Bucket Versioning is enabled.

Do NOT merge this until we resolve #64 so that we can write a failing unit test for this to validate that the change.

# Implement minimal debug feature

**yorinasub17** commented *Jul 24, 2020*

This takes https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1137 and reduces the scope to just outputting a workable tfvars file. This should be the minimal increment for a usable debug command that should significantly improve status quo.

@brikis98 any objections to merging this version of debug mode in? This is the original implementation, where it doesn't touch the main way terragrunt passes vars, and instead introduces debug mode as a way to emit the tfvars json file.

Thanks for review! Merging and releasing now.

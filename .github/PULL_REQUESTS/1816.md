Added conversion of module path to OS native format
Not sure how to add a proper test for this bug since on Windows environment tests aren't executed

Tests on Windows:
Before:
```
D:\terragrunt-work\terragrunt-test-1815>terragrunt run-all plan --terragrunt-non-interactive

time=2021-09-17T20:24:13+02:00 level=error msg=2 errors occurred:
        * Cannot process module Module D:/terragrunt-work/terragrunt-test-1815/applications/gateway/app1 (excluded: false, dependencies: [D:/terragrunt-work/terragrunt-test-1815/shared/service-discovery-core]) because one of its dependencies, Module D:/terragrunt-work/terragrunt-test-1815/shared/service-discovery-core (excluded: false, dependencies: [D:/terragrunt-work/terragrunt-test-1815/shared/vpc]), finished with an error: Found paths in the 'dependencies' block that do not exist: [../vpc (vpc)]
        * Found paths in the 'dependencies' block that do not exist: [../vpc (vpc)]
```
After:
```
D:\terragrunt-work\terragrunt-test-1815>terragrunt run-all plan --terragrunt-non-interactive

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

```

Fix LGTM, thanks Denis!

I had a quick look into why the Windows tests aren't running, and it looks like the test function had been renamed but the related change was not made in the CircleCI config. Specifically, [this line](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml#L32) in the CI config references `TestTerragruntSourceMapDebug`, but the test function is actually called [`TestWindowsTerragruntSourceMapDebug`](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/test/integration_windows_test.go#L30). Would you mind fixing this as part of this PR? (And while you're at it, might as well fix [this comment](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/test/integration_windows_test.go#L28) too.)

Great, the windows test is now running and passing!

Last question before we merge this - is there a way to add a regression test for this fix?

Hi, regression test for this issue will be any test that uses a relative path for dependencies
I will try to add in windows tests one of the existing fixtures

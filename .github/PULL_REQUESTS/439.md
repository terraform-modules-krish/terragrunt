# Terragrunt hooks

**eak12913** commented *Mar 19, 2018*

This is my stab at implementing [#377](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/377)

Notes:
- `run_on_error`: allows users to control whether this hook should run if a previous error occurred (from a previous hook or from terraform execution)
- `run_on_error`: if you don't specify it, `false` is the default

Before hook syntax:
```    
   before_hook "copy-file-before2" {
      commands = ["apply", "plan"]
      execute = ["echo", "Hello World"]
      run_on_error = true
    }
```

After hook syntax:
```
    after_hook "after-copy-file" {
      commands = ["apply", "plan"]
      execute = ["echo", "After Hook Running"]
      run_on_error = true
    }
```

Yikes! Youâ€™re right! Iâ€™ll try to get that done today or tomorrow.

I'll wait for the tests to run, and if they pass, issue a new release.

Fixed some nil pointer dereferences in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/448.

@eak12913 : i tried playing a bit with new hooks and i realized hooks are running inside terragrunt's tmp dir, which means after the terragrunt has created it and moved the files there.

```
[terragrunt] 2018/03/28 16:51:48 Detected 1 Hooks
[terragrunt] 2018/03/28 16:51:48 Executing hook: compute component.tfvars
[terragrunt] 2018/03/28 16:51:48 Running command: pwd 
/Users/ebarault/.terragrunt/ZjqqRQuRq2pdCMh0Hi_tpQ-ukQc/UVUxJQl7b4LfD1lr_uBnKFydomI/path/to/dir
```

in my case, i'd also need hooks that would happen before in the terragrunt source code dir.

what do you think would be the simpler to implement, add an option to the `before_hook` block? or create another type of hook? such as `initial_hook`?

@ebarault: I discussed this with @brikis98 and he proposed an interesting idea:  What if we provided a `working_dir` parameter for the hook? This would default to terragrunt's working dir, but could be overridden to anything you need.  Could this work for you?
***

**ebarault** commented *Mar 29, 2018*

By "terragrunt's working dir", do you mean the location where the original `terraform.tfvars` sits or the tmp dir where it is copied to?

See https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/453, i have also a temporality issue with when the hooks happen: thanks to terragrunt's interpolation functions i managed running the hooks in the source code dir, but then the problem is that they happen after terragrunt's parsing of `required_var_files` / `optional_var_files`.

So if the file (which i want to generate with hooks) is missing at terragrunt's execution, even though it's generated just after, it will be skipped by terragrunt.
```
[terragrunt] 2018/03/28 19:53:13 Skipping var-file /path/to/component.tfvars as it does not exist
```

I ended up generating the file directly in the tmp dir as suggested by @lorengordon using the `.auto.tfvars` extension so it gets automatically parsed by terraform.

Not an ideal solution if you ask me as it makes the workflow difficult to understand, and we have to care about the tmp folder which should remain out of end user's concern.

A more natural solution would have the before hooks doing any required action actually before any other terragrunt step, then the regular terragrunt workflow takes place.

# Added AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN for support old aws sdk

**alexandrst88** commented *Jan 13, 2020*

Hi! 

I use credentials secured helper tools such a `vaulted` and `aws-vault` for safely store my AWS credentials on the laptop. 

I run terragrunt for multi-account setup, and authenticate  via multi assume iam roles steps. account X iam role -> account Y iam role.
So my ~/.aws/config looks like:

```
[profile test]
role_arn = arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxx:role/admin
region = us-east-1
```
and my terragrunt.hcl in the root of repository looks like 

```
iam_role = "arn:aws:iam:: xxxxxxxxxx:role/terragrant-in-another-account"

remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
OUTPUT OMMITED......
````

The issue if you run terraform local-exec provider, it will spawn new shell, but it will inherit env variables from terragrunt/terraform environment and the vaulted and aws-vaulted, sets `AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN` environment variable(which is set for backward compatibility for old AWS sdk as far as I understood from commits and documentation of tools). And you have AWS_SESSION_TOKEN and AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN set with different values, and AWS throws

```An error occurred (UnrecognizedClientException) when calling the GetParameter operation: The security token included in the request is invalid.```

https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.21.11 : binaries should show up after our CI build, which typically take 7~10 mins.

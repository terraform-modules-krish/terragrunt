# Add links to the sample repos to the README

**brikis98** commented *Jul 2, 2017*

I recently created a couple sample repos that demonstrate how to use Terragrunt:

https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-modules-example
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example

This PR updates the README to link to these repos in a few places.

Fairly straightforward change, so I'm going to merge. Feedback welcome!

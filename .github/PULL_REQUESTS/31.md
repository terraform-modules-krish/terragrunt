# all: enable simpler lock provider support with more generic config

**pmcatominey** commented *Sep 26, 2016*

- dynamodb package moved under locks directory
- hcl lock config now in snake_case
- hcl lock config uses same generic style as remote state
- go fmt has fixed formatting on some edited files

Thanks, I've amended most and left comments on others.
1. Yes this is mostly a refactor to separate some of the code, the aim is to make adding a provider as simple as writing a package and adding an entry to the builtin map.
2. I'll be updating the README once the code is finished.
3. I assumed that the variables were just hidden from the CircleCI output, I'll look into running the tests once I have an AWS setup.

@brikis98 I've updated the README examples to the new syntax and ran the full test suite with AWS credentials, everything is now passing.

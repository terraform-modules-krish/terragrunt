# Add more debug logging to help debug issues in the future

**yorinasub17** commented *Nov 11, 2019*

This introduces two new debug logs that would be helpful for debugging https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/906:

- Log the terragrunt version if `TG_LOG=debug`
- Log the start of output retrieval for a dependency block

Going to merge this in given that this is pretty straightforward and will help with the current thread in #906.

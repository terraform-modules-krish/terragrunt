I'll really appreciate if someone can give this PR ðŸ‘€. It will solve a small but very annoying problem.

It looks like there hasn't been an update to add a regression test yet (as [requested in my comment](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1165#pullrequestreview-407931844)). If anyone has interest to continue this PR to add a regression test, I can pull this fork into a branch into this repo so you can get it on your forks to commit on top of it.

please have a look. It adds a few test cases to ensure "region" is not being placed in random order.

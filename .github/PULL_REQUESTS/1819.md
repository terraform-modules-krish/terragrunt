Partially addresses https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1818 by enhancing the error message.

Example error message:

```
ERRO[0000] Not all locals could be evaluated:
ERRO[0000]      - foo [REASON: Can't evaluate expression at /Users/yoriy/gruntwork/tools/terragrunt/terragrunt.hcl:2,9-24: you can only reference other local variables here, but it looks like you're referencing something else (not_defined is not defined)]
ERRO[0000]      - bar [REASON: Can't evaluate expression at /Users/yoriy/gruntwork/tools/terragrunt/terragrunt.hcl:3,9-18 because local reference 'foo' is not evaluated. Either it is not ready yet in the current pass, or there was an error evaluating it in an earlier stage.]
ERRO[0000] Could not evaluate all locals in block.
ERRO[0000] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1
```

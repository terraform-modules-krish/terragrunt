# allowing get_env() to run without the `DEFAULT` argument

**ebarault** commented *Dec 10, 2017*

Related to https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/391

This PR allows the `get_env()` helper to work with a single argument such as in `get_env("ENV_VAR_NAME")`

- existing test cases pass
- 2 new test cases are provided to test the new expectations
- updated README.md

...
I tested the new implementation in the following UC: 

```
    extra_arguments "password" {
      commands = ["${get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars()}"]
      arguments = ["-var", "'password=${get_env("DB_PWD")}'"]
    }
```
And it works like a charm
**But** beware not to forget the single quotes surrounding the var definition as in `-var 'foo=bar'` or in `"'password=${get_env("DB_PWD")}'"`.

for some reason `terraform plan [..] -var some_var=` will assign an empty string to `some_var` instead of not setting `some_var`, when `terraform plan [..] -var 'some_var='` works OK

Is this still in progress, or stuck? Would love to see this feature land.

@lorengordon : i'll try summing up the above discussion and resume the work on it soon.

What behavior would you expect from an end-user perspective?

**lorengordon** commented *May 14, 2018*

I'd say something like this:

```
export FOO=foo

get_env("FOO", "bar")
# returns "foo"

get_env("FOO")
# returns "foo"

unset FOO

get_env("FOO", "bar")
# returns "bar"

get_env("FOO")
# raises exception and exits non-zero
```

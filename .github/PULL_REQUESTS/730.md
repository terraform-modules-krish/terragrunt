# improve string escape handling for run_cmd

**twang817** commented *Jun 6, 2019*

While #684 addresses the real issues here, I made a small change for better handling of escapes in run_cmd.

This allowed me to use run_cmd in the following way:

```
$ tree .
.
├── child
│   ├── config.json
│   └── terraform.tfvars
├── plans
│   └── testplan
│       ├── v0.1
│       │   └── main.tf
│       └── v0.2
│           └── main.tf
└── terraform.tfvars
```

The child's terraform.tfvars is nothing special
```
$ cat child/terraform.tfvars
terragrunt {
    include {
        path = "${find_in_parent_folders()}"
    }
}
```

The config.json specifies the data the run_cmd fetches:
```
$ cat child/config.json
{
    "source": "testplan",
    "version": "v0.1"
}
```

The two plans are simple:
```
$ cat plans/testplan/v0.1/main.tf
output "version" {
    value = "v0.1"
}

$ cat plans/testplan/v0.2/main.tf
output "version" {
    value = "v0.2"
}
```

Finally, the magic is in the root terraform.tfvars:
```
$ cat terraform.tfvars
terragrunt {
    terraform {
        source = "${path_relative_from_include()}/plans//${run_cmd("jq", "-j", ". | \"\\(.source)/\\(.version)\"", "config.json")}/"
    }
}
```

If you're unfamiliar with jq, the command is:

```
$ jq -j '. | "\(.source)/\(.version)"' config.json
testplan/v0.1
```

And the output of the run:
```

Terraform initialized in an empty directory!

The directory has no Terraform configuration files. You may begin working
with Terraform immediately by creating Terraform configuration files.

[terragrunt] [/<snip>/child] 2019/06/06 03:50:40 Running command: terraform init

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
[terragrunt] 2019/06/06 03:50:40 Running command: terraform apply

Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

version = v0.1
```

This basically works by having run_cmd extract the source & version key from config.json and build a path starting from the plans// directory.

I believe this resolves #684, as I have both prefixes and suffixes around run_cmd.  It further allows better handling of escaped quotes within the run_cmd parameters.

The PR is a bit dense with regex, so I'll try to comment inline.

Lastly, I was able to run all the tests (and even added a few) in the config directory, but I was unable to pass all tests from the root.  I believe there are several tests that actually rely on AWS -- and I am unable to do so.

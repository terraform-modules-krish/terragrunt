# Fix empty outputs

**amnk** commented *Feb 28, 2021*

If stack run finished without errors, `summarizePlanAllErrors()`
receives empty buffer and outputs empty line. This change ensures that
only non-empty outputs are getting logged.

@brikis98 this PR fixes empty lines only, as it's a bug. First part (with Module output which is apparently excessive) will require some more work.

## Description

**Issue:** The `terraform init` output is displayed twice in `stderr` when it's triggered by `auto-init` (doc: https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/auto-init/).

The output looks like this:
```
... omitted
time=2023-05-05T13:23:46+03:00 level=debug msg=Running command: terraform init prefix=[/live/stage/data-stores/mysql]
Initializing the backend...
... omitted

time=2023-05-05T13:23:46+03:00 level=debug msg=Running command: terraform init prefix=[/live/stage/data-stores/mysql]

```
This _terragrunt output_ gives the impression that `terraform init` is being run twice.

**Fixed:** On successful auto-initialization, the output of `terraform init` is not displayed at all.

Fixes #2519.

# For local file copy create a manifest with a list of files.

**ekini** commented *Jul 3, 2019*

That allows to safely delete only the files we copied on the previous
copy, and not worry about stale files still living in the working directory.

Also removes some unused functions.

Initially I wanted to compare source and destination directories, but we use [CopyFolderContentsWithFilter](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/util/file.go#L150) at least two times, so this will not work.

The only way I see is to create a list of files we touch, and delete them just before copying new files.

Used [gob](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/gob) as the simplest serialiser. Added some tests.

I've had another look and it seems the code didn't handle subfolders correctly. I'll fix that and add more tests with corner cases.

**ekini** commented *Jul 8, 2019*

@brikis98 added more tests, fixed subfolders handling, looks much better to me now :)

Hi, this doesn't seem to fix the issue I'm experiencing from the original issue.  I have to still clear the cache and the error produced is as per the originally reported bug.

https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/764#issuecomment-511704040

Sorry I can't help more at the moment.

Ok, found another bug when the destination directory is not created, but it tries to create a manifest file there. Fixed

I've created a homebrew formula that installs terragrunt with this patch, along with `terraform` version that doesn't complain about unset variables. Just if anyone wants to try it.
```bash
$brew install springload/tools/terragrunt
```

@brikis98 I can't reproduce it. It works on my machine ™️ , plus I took a plain golang image:
```
docker run -ti --rm -v "$(pwd):/go/src/github.com/gruntwork/terragrunt" golang:1.12-alpine
/go # apk add git g++ gcc terraform > /dev/null && go get -u github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep && cd src/github.com/gruntwork/terragrunt/
/go/src/github.com/gruntwork/terragrunt # dep ensure
/go/src/github.com/gruntwork/terragrunt # go test ./cli
ok      github.com/gruntwork/terragrunt/cli     29.499s
```
I'd be glad to debug the CircleCI build, but the docker image it uses seems to be private.

**brikis98** commented *Jul 26, 2019*

Perhaps it's a race condition? Is `TestDownloadTerraformSourceFromLocalFolderWithManifest` copying lots of files/folders to a common destination and perhaps something is overwriting something else? 
***

**ekini** commented *Jul 26, 2019*

Doesn't seem to be a race condition. Not sure what's happening there. I haven't been able to reproduce it yet.

My wild guess is something wrong with temp folder in the Docker image.
***

**brikis98** commented *Jul 29, 2019*

I'm probably missing something, but how is [this test case supposed](https://github.com/springload/terragrunt/blob/fix/file_copy/cli/download_source_test.go#L196-L200) to work? 

It looks like you're calling [copyFolder](https://github.com/springload/terragrunt/blob/fix/file_copy/cli/download_source_test.go#L212) on `"../test/fixture-manifest/version-5-empty-subfolder"`, which [solely contains a main.tf file](https://github.com/springload/terragrunt/tree/fix/file_copy/test/fixture-manifest/version-5-empty-subfolder). The test is then checking for a [sub2 folder](https://github.com/springload/terragrunt/blob/fix/file_copy/cli/download_source_test.go#L199). Where would that folder come from?
***

**ekini** commented *Jul 30, 2019*

That's a very good point! It explains everything: when I tested it in a fresh Docker container I copied the codebase I had including the `sub2` folder, which obviously doesn't get committed to git. I've modified the test to create a temp folder with another folder inside, and use it as a source.
***

**brikis98** commented *Jul 30, 2019*

OK, great, kicking off tests again

That was result of bad resolving of a conflict. I'm sure I've seen the CircleCI build process before, but can't see it now.

Re-running tests.

# Fix config_dir support on Windows

**bltavares** commented *Aug 28, 2020*

Using the `config_dir` attribute on a `terragrunt.hcl` when running
it on Windows didn't load the appropriate configuration as expected.

[This line](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/c395cdfdf1dd71a7cab0e4b6e07305d1d188e0d4/cli/cli_app.go#L320)
seems to be the culprit.



On Windows, the file path comparison was using a forward-slash on one
variable, and a backward-slash file separator on the other, never
entering the conditional branch and loading the information from
`terragrunt.hcl`.

This commit introduces a call to change change the file-separator as
other parts of the codebase does, so the default folder uses forward-slash
 and the comparison passes.

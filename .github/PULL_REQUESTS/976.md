# Terragrunt website jekyll gh

**tomaszantas** commented *Dec 12, 2019*

The Terragrunt website built with Jekyll.

The website is compatible with Github Pages and can be served from the **/docs** folder on **master** branch as it is. No more actions are required. Github will automatically rebuild the website after every commit.

I rebased branch and split changes into 2 commits:

1. https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/976/commits/31c0995dcafcf2431142ddb4f20bced4283a4751 - commits only `/docs` folder containing Terragrunt website. It changes nothing in existing files.

2. https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/976/commits/ab15c598cc1dedae57bb5d7e04b793abe1816639 - contains only change in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. It's a link to the website documentation.

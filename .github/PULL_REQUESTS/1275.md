# Fix bug where dependency output call runs hooks 

**yorinasub17** commented *Jul 31, 2020*

Fixes #1273 and #1274

The cause of the bug is that we weren't setting `TerraformCommand` on the cloned options when retrieving the outputs, so the `terraform output` call was running in the context of the current command.

Yup, because `TerraformCommand` is actually what is used for hook determination, not `TerraformCliArgs`.

# Added retry for when module lookup fails from app.terraform.io

**robbruce** commented *Sep 13, 2020*

Similar to #1332 however, the output can also appear from terraform as

```
Error: Error accessing remote module registry

Failed to retrieve available versions for module "x" (main.tf:123) from
app.terraform.io: error looking up module versions: 429 Too Many Requests.
```

which is a subtly different message to pattern match
<br />

And just to show this patch detects the retry, this appears when using

```
Error: Error accessing remote module registry

Failed to retrieve available versions for module "x" (main.tf:123) from
app.terraform.io: error looking up module versions: 429 Too Many Requests.

[terragrunt] [/path/to/module] 2020/09/13 22:05:19 Encountered an error eligible for retrying. Sleeping 5s before retrying.
```

Hi @robbruce, thank you for the Pull Request!

Do you think that, given how similar the errors are, the regular expression introduced in Pull Request https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1332 could be made to match all of the similarly looking messages? The end-result is to recover (retry) from the **429** status code sent back from the Terraform Registry.

Hm, I think we're hitting some sort of CircleCi bug. All the tests ran and passed, but CircleCi shows the build as "queued":

I think I'll cancel and re-run just in case.

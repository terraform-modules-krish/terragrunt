# Dependency optimization

**yorinasub17** commented *Aug 23, 2020*

This is an attempt at partially resolving https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1103 

I thought if there was a way we can optimize the remote state fetching to avoid recursively parsing all the dependencies, and realized that if the config follows a few conventions, this is possible.

- The remote state is managed using `remote_state` blocks.
- The `remote_state` block is in generate mode (the `generate` attribute is set).
- The `remote_state` block itself does not depend on any `dependency` outputs (`locals` and `include` are ok).

When these conditions are met, we are able to generate a terraform module that only contains the remote state backend configuration, which we can use to run `terraform output` to get the recorded outputs from the state without retrieving dependencies. You don't even need the full module source to do this!

Note that supporting arbitrary terragrunt configuration (e.g. those managing backends with `generate`) is difficult as there won't be a stable API we could define to account for all the cases. For these configurations, we will have to fall back to the old method until we are ready to relax these constraints further.

> I'm probably missing something obvious. Can you state it differently?

What I mean is that in order to support a generic solution that works for any terragrunt configuration, we need to implement some complex parsing mechanism that supports just-in-time lookups to ensure that we only get the information that is absolutely necessary.

This is because we don't have a stable API for managing remote state blocks in terragrunt: there are multiple ways one can do this between:

- Using `remote_state` block.
- Using `generate` block to generate the backend config.
- Using `extra_arguments` to feed the specific backend config to `init` calls.
- Using `dependency` references in `generate` blocks to output backend config blocks for buckets managed by terraform.

If we had graph based jit parsing, we could just parse all these elements of terragrunt that pertain to `init` and remote state, walking up the tree, only resolving those that are referenced. However, since we don't have a complex parsing mechanism and since we don't really have an appetite for that, we need to use heuristics and constraints to ensure we can do partial parsing without getting everything.

Unfortunately, we won't be able to replicate the optimizations here for each of these use cases, until we are start enforcing stricter constraints on the config similar to what we stated here. This could be limiting as stricter parsing means less flexibility. Hence, I decided to punt on expanded use cases for now.

As an aside, the next one I see being possible is if we introduce a way to flag `generate` blocks that are used to generate backend config (with a special attribute like `is_state_block = true`).

Thanks for review! I'm going to merge this in now and release so we can start benefitting!

# #1921 Version check before creating auto-init flag file

**denis256** commented *Nov 19, 2021*

Added check for source code version before creating file for auto-init, if terraform source is changed - create auto init file

Example runs:
Local dependency(https://github.com/Ic3w0lf/terragrunt-test/tree/main/auto-init-issue/accounts/prod/vpc):
```
$ terragrunt plan
Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Reusing previous version of hashicorp/local from the dependency lock file
- Installing hashicorp/local v2.1.0...
- Installed hashicorp/local v2.1.0 (signed by HashiCorp)

Terraform has been successfully initialized!
...

$ terragrunt plan
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

```

Changing terraform source path(https://github.com/denis256/terragrunt-tests/tree/master/terragrunt-init)
```
$ terragrunt plan
Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Reusing previous version of hashicorp/local from the dependency lock file
- Using previously-installed hashicorp/local v2.1.0

Terraform has been successfully initialized!
...
$ terragrunt plan
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create
```
Change terraform source:
```
$ terragrunt plan
Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Reusing previous version of hashicorp/local from the dependency lock file
- Using previously-installed hashicorp/local v2.1.0

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

This again LGTM! With the added context of #1901 I understand a bit better why it was failing before. Go ahead and merge and release!

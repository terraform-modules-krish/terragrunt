# Remove unused appveyor

<!-- Prepend '[WIP]' to the title if this PR is still a work-in-progress. Remove it when it is ready for review! -->

## Description

Removes appveyor config. We originally used it as a way to test Windows, but since we didn't really have an Azure account, we never got to fully materialize it.

Since then, CircleCI has announced support for Windows which we rolled out in our current config, so this removes the unused Appveyor config.

# Add checksums to release files

**conn** commented *Mar 2, 2019*

This is to address:
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/610

The checksums of all binaries within `bin/` will be saved within
`SHA256SUMS`. The integrity of binaries can now be verified with this
command: `sha256sum --check --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS`.

In the future, Gruntwork should consider using a PGP key to
cryptographically sign this checksums file and to distribute the
signature along with the rest of the release files. Doing so will likely
require using private CI/CD infrastructure instead of CircleCI so that
Gruntwork may have full control over their private signing key.

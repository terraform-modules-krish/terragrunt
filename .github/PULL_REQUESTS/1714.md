# Fix data type issue with aws-provider-patch

**yorinasub17** commented *Jun 11, 2021*

Fixes #1709 

`aws-provider-patch` blindly patches the provider attributes to string type, but the underlying type for the provider might be different (as is the case with `allowed_account_ids`). To support this, I updated the `aws-provider-patch` to use json inputs instead.

Note that this does result in a backward incompatible API as you now need to provide `"` for the json to resolve correctly. I updated the docs accordingly to highlight this.

Thanks for review! Going to merge this in and cut a backward incompatible release.

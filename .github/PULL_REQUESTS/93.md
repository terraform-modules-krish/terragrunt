# Update AWS SDK to latest - v1.6.10

**mechastorm** commented *Jan 5, 2017*

In order to fix #92, AWS GO SDK was updated to the latest by running `glide up --all-dependencies`

Built a binary as suggest on OS X and seems to run fine as expected.

Unit test output in case it is needed
```shell
mechastorm@nerv terragrunt (aws-sdk-update) $ glide up --all-dependencies

Wonderful, thanks!

Just created a new release here: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.7.4. Assuming the build passes, the new binaries should be there in a few minutes.

@brikis98  Seems the builds are failing since the merge - https://circleci.com/gh/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/196

Seems to be because of failing tests 
```

Kinda odd because I did not encounter that error in my test run.
***

**brikis98** commented *Jan 6, 2017*

@mechastorm Yea, I'm looking into it and trying to figure out what the cause is. There actually seem to be a few bugs at play, including one that has to do with DynamoDB resource limits (the automated tests are creating/deleting too many tables concurrently), and one that is mysteriously causing the tests to fail without a clear error message. Very confusing.
***

**brikis98** commented *Jan 7, 2017*

OK, apologies for the delay. There turned out to be two bugs:

1. The automated tests were trying to create/delete more DynamoDB tables concurrently than AWS allows. I've put in a counting semaphore to prevent this.
1. The latest version of the `urfave/cli` library, which we probably pulled in as part of this PR, added a new `OsExiter` setting which defaults to `os.Exit`. Because of this, when there was an error, the automated tests would exit without any useful error message, without running `defer`ed cleanup tasks, etc. This made it very hard to debug. I'm getting a bit fed up with `urfave/cli`, so if anyone has a recommendation for a better Go CLI library, let me know.

Both of these issues should now be fixed and the new binaries are available here: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.7.4

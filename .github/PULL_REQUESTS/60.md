# Add spin-up and tear-down commands

**brikis98** commented *Nov 30, 2016*

This PR adds `spin-up` and `tear-down` commands to Terragrunt that can be used to run `terragrunt apply` or `terragrunt destroy`, respectively, in a bunch of subfolders in parallel. This way, even if you have your Terraform code defined in separate modules to get isolation, you can still deploy or undeploy an entire environment in a single command.

To manage dependencies between modules (e.g. VPC must be deployed before an app), the `.terragrunt` config now lets you specify a `dependencies` block with a list of paths that must be deployed before the current module.

This was quite a bit more work than I originally expected. In particular, it took a while to write tests for this, and it’s good that I did, as they flushed out a huge number of very subtle bugs (and more may be lurking!).

This fixes #45. It’s an incremental solution for it, anyway.

@josh-padnick Please review this when you get a chance. Mainly focus on the `spin` package and the `README`, as much of the rest of the diff is less interesting refactoring (and a TON of test code).

Merging now.

# Move bucket creation check

**brikis98** commented *Jul 1, 2018*

Terragrunt has a method that checks if someone is already creating an S3 bucket concurrently. However, even if that error is detected, after detecting it, we continued to try to configure the bucket in other ways (e.g., enable versioning) anyway. This PR updates the code to to skip all the other bucket creation steps if someone else is already doing them concurrently.

This will hopefully fix the intermittent test failures we were seeing that had errors such as "OperationAborted: A conflicting conditional operation is currently in progress against this resource. Please try again." (e.g., https://circleci.com/gh/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/609).

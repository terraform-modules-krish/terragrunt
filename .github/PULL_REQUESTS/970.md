# Add option to use pseudotty for interactive commands

**yorinasub17** commented *Dec 4, 2019*

This resolves https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/724, which is caused by the fact that we are not using a pseudo-tty for interactive prompts. The terminal driver is needed for the readline to work correctly with commands like `terraform console`.

After this fix, you should be able to use the console via terragrunt with `terragrunt console --terragrunt-ptty`

Updated parsing of AWS policy statement to handle cases when fields "Action" and "Policy" are returned as arrays instead of strings

Closes: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/2113

We're experiencing this issue with one of our AWS accounts as well, and I can confirm the PR solves it.

And a workaround is making the existing bucket policy use a list in the Resource if it's a string (this was the case in some of our RootAccess rules) eg. change the first line to the second
```
"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::$BUCKET_NAME"

"Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::$BUCKET_NAME", "arn:aws:s3:::$BUCKET_NAME/*"]
```

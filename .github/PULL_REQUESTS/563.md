# implement exclude-dir cli flag

**msvechla** commented *Sep 7, 2018*

This implements https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/355 by adding a `-terragrunt-exclude-dir` CLI flag.

It supports unix-style globs and will exclude all modules within or under the specified directories during execution.

Let me know if additional things need to be adjusted.

Thanks for your very valuable feedback. This is my first bigger MR using golang, so there is definitely a lot to learn. I'll go over it and let you know once I'm done.

I tried adding some integration tests, but they are not working yet as expected. Will take another look at it tomorrow.

Sounds good. Let me know if you need any help sorting it out. And thank you for the work you're putting into this PR!
***

**msvechla** commented *Sep 16, 2018*

Did some refactoring (see discussions) and added integration tests. Would be awesome if you can take another look!

Thanks! I'm a bit bogged down today, but I'll take a look tomorrow.

Thanks again for your detailed review, I am learning a lot here! I adjusted everything according to your input, would be awesome if you could check again.

I just pushed another update, found an error while running tests.

Now I am stuck at an error with test: `TestToRunningModulesTwoModulesWithDependenciesReverseOrder()`

Is this test case correct?
`runningModuleB` has no dependencies, while `moduleB` has a dependency.
Is this correct, or should the dependencies of `runningModuleB` match for the test case?
```
moduleB := &TerraformModule{
		Path:              "b",
		Dependencies:      []*TerraformModule{moduleA},
		Config:            config.TerragruntConfig{},
		TerragruntOptions: mockOptions,
	}

	runningModuleB := &runningModule{
		Module:         moduleB,
		Status:         Waiting,
		Err:            nil,
		Dependencies:   map[string]*runningModule{},
		NotifyWhenDone: []*runningModule{runningModuleA},
	}
```

Well, note that the dependencies are being used in reverse order in that test... So B depends on A... But when we do something in reverse order (e.g., `terragrunt destroy-all`), we want to do the action first on B and then on A (i.e., we can't destroy A before B or we'll get an error). So `runningModuleB` has `runningModuleA` in `NotifyWhenDone`.

Thanks for giving a little bit more insight here, totally makes sense. With this information I found the issue and fixed it (see latest commit). I also successfully ran all tests now, including the ones requiring AWS credentials:

The only issue I get is with `TestCheckTerraformVersionMeetsConstraintGreaterDev`:

``` 

EDIT: looks like this one fails for me on the master as-well. I will look into it.

Do you have a custom (i.e., locally-built) version of Terraform installed (0.9.4-dev)? If so, it looks like the version check we do doesn't take `-dev` into account. If you try it with an official release of Terraform in your `PATH`, it should work.
***

**msvechla** commented *Sep 25, 2018*

Actually this has nothing to do with the installed version. This test is simply checking hardcoded versions.

This is the entire test:

``` 
func TestCheckTerraformVersionMeetsConstraintGreaterDev(t *testing.T) {
	t.Parallel()
	testCheckTerraformVersionMeetsConstraint(t, "v0.9.4-dev", ">= v0.9.3", true)
}
``` 

Drilling a little bit down on the function, it actually mostly calls the https://github.com/hashicorp/go-version module. So it seems like an external module is tested here. Does this test work for you on master? Maybe something changed on the module end which breaks the check.

EDIT: Looks like this is an issue with the upstream module:

```go
package main

import (
        "fmt"
        "github.com/hashicorp/go-version"
)

func main() {

        v1, _ := version.NewVersion("v0.9.4-dev")
        v2, _ := version.NewVersion("v0.9.3")

        if v1.GreaterThan(v2) {
                fmt.Printf("%s is greater than %s \n", v1, v2)
        }

        versionConstraint, _ := version.NewConstraint(">= v0.9.3")
        if !versionConstraint.Check(v1) {
                fmt.Printf("%s does not satisfy constraint %s! \n", v1, versionConstraint)
        }

}
``` 

Output:

```bash
0.9.4-dev is greater than 0.9.3
0.9.4-dev does not satisfy constraint >= v0.9.3!
```

I checked the module code directly, and found the following in [constraint.go](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-version/blob/master/constraint.go#L125):
```go
case !cPre && vPre:
		// A constraint without a pre-release can only match a version without a
		// pre-release.
		return false 
```
For me this means that our check is invalid and probably never worked. Do you agree?

Yes, the tests passed on master just 14 hours ago. Is it possible you have a different version of `go-version` installed and something changed upstream?

Sorry for the confusion, I cleaned-up my local environment and ran `dep ensure`. Now all tests finished successfully.

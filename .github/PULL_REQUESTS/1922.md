# Support terragrunt args encoded as --OPTION_KEY=VALUE

**yorinasub17** commented *Nov 18, 2021*

Our internal pipeline guards only handle option args encoded as `--OPTION_KEY=VALUE`, which makes it impossible to pass in terragrunt args because it currently only supports encoding as `--OPTION_KEY VALUE`.

This PR updates terragrunt arg parsing to support the `--OPTION_KEY=VALUE` encoding.

Curious / sanity check: does this have any implications for the terragrunt validate / --terragrunt-strict behavior? I'm thinking not because it looks like your changes handle both styles of arg presentation / normalize them as needed.

Nope no implications, as boolean args are handled in the same way as before. This only affects the string based args.

Thanks for review! I am reasonably confident this is backward compatible given the regression tests, so I'll go ahead and merge this in.

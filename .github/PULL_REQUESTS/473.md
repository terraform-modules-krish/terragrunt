# Bugfix: show help for terraform commands

**jckuester** commented *May 6, 2018*

This PR fixes the issue described in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/314:

If there is a --help, -help or -h flag provided by a user
for a command that is forwarded to terraform (e.g. terragrunt plan --help),
don't throw any error because a config file is missing
or other checks fail, but show the help text (this should have
precedence).

# Implement a mechanism for providing macro placeholders and substitutions

**erhudy** commented *Jan 27, 2022*

This implements a mechanism to allow Terragrunt to recognize and replace
specific macro placeholders in the Terraform command line with a
value specific to that instantiation of Terraform. The only implemented
macro in this commit is `::TERRAGRUNT_DIR::`, which is replaced with
the directory of the Terragrunt file.

The use case here is to allow Terragrunt to interact smoothly with our GitLab CI
processes and artifact archival by being able to control exactly where our generated
plans are created, instead of them being created deep inside `.terragrunt-cache`
somewhere.

I love this idea. I implemented something similar in a wrapper cli, to pattern match the terragrunt working directory and replace matches in the terraform command. Very handy for `state mv`, where the resource id includes an account/region/env-specific identifier (and those attributes are in the path to the working directory)...

Test results are here: https://gist.github.com/erhudy/a633e186ff37f6e5148d6b16245dca13

Most of the failures seem to be because I am running the test suite on an M1 Mac and certain provider/version combos are not available for that platform from the HashiCorp Registry.

@denis256 Thanks for the feedback, made changes to address your comments.

@denis256 any update on getting something like this merged in?
***

**erhudy** commented *Mar 2, 2023*

For the record, I've been using this in my company's internal version of Terragrunt since I made this PR (so over a year). If there is still interest in adding it, I'll fix the merge conflicts.

**lorengordon** commented *Mar 2, 2023*

I am still also interested :)

**lstn** commented *Mar 2, 2023*

Thinking a bit more about it, something that would help my usecase it would be nice if eventually the scope of this included defining custom macros through configuration instead of solely relying on hardcoded macros like here. Maybe that's a next step though :)

Rebased this on current master.

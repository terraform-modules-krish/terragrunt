# #1457 Detection of duplicated "generate" blocks in HCL files

**denis256** commented *Sep 3, 2021*

Updated `Terragrunt` to detect generate blocks with duplicate name, fix for issue https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1457

Example:
```
$ cat terragrunt.hcl
generate "backend" {
  path = "data.txt"
  if_exists = "overwrite"
  contents = "test data1"
}
generate "backend2" {
  path = "data2.txt"
  if_exists = "overwrite"
  contents = "test data2"
}
generate "backend" {
  path = "data.txt"
  if_exists = "overwrite"
  contents = "test data11"
}
generate "backend2" {
  path = "data2.txt"
  if_exists = "overwrite"
  contents = "test data22"
}

generate "backend3" {
  path = "data3.txt"
  if_exists = "overwrite"
  contents = "test data3"
}

$ terragrunt init
ERRO[0000] Detected generate blocks with the same name: [backend backend2] 
ERRO[0000] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1 

```
Included changes:
 * configuration loading updates
 * integration tests to cover this case

Ah, tests failed, but it's because of an unrelated bug where the test cases can't handle branch names with slashes in them: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1778. @denis256 Would you mind fixing that one first in a separate PR? Once that's resolved, we can pull `master` into your several other PRs and see if that gets the tests to pass. Thanks!

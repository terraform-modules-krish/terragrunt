# Mutex output call

**yorinasub17** commented *Oct 30, 2019*

This is an alternative to https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/930, where we mutex the output call. This uses a mutex lock to ensure that only one `terragrunt output` call will be made at a time, avoiding the issues highlighted in #906 and #904 

As a bonus, this will reuse the outputs across calls. This is made possible with the additional synchronization.

> Is there a way to add a regression test that has several modules looking up an output from the same module? Ideally, that test would fail before this change and pass after...

I had thought about this, but this doesn't quite run into the same error when using local modules: it has to be a remote module that is downloaded. But didn't have a good one to use...

We have a few examples we use with remote download URLs in tests. E.g., https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/test/fixture-download/remote/terragrunt.hcl#L6

Ok added a regression test where I can verify the problem from master

Will wait another day to see if we can get some confirmation that this works for the original issue reporters.

**yorinasub17** commented *Nov 1, 2019*

Given the regression test and https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/904#issuecomment-548229229, I am going to go ahead and merge + release this. If it turns out that this doesn't resolve the issue, we can revive https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/930

# Add terraform command validation

**levkohimins** commented *Aug 19, 2023*

## Description

If you specify a misspelled root command, `terragrunt` does not immediately return an error instead will perform various operations, such as `terragrunt init` or initialization of the AWS S3 bucket before returning an error.

## Related Issues

Fixes #438

There is no `login` command, is there are reason for that?

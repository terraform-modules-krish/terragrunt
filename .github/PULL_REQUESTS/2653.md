## Description
Included changes:
 - updated `run-all` confirmation message to be easy to read

Before:
```
$ terragrunt run-all apply
Module /home/denis/projects/gruntwork/terragrunt-tests/multiple-dependencies/app depends on module /home/denis/projects/gruntwork/terragrunt-tests/multiple-dependencies/m3, which is an external dependency outside of the current working directory. Should Terragrunt run this external dependency? Warning, if you say 'yes', Terragrunt will make changes in /home/denis/projects/gruntwork/terragrunt-tests/multiple-dependencies/m3 as well! (y/n) 

```
After:
```
$ run-all apply
Module:                  /home/denis/projects/gruntwork/terragrunt-tests/multiple-dependencies/app
External dependency:     /home/denis/projects/gruntwork/terragrunt-tests/multiple-dependencies/m1
Should Terragrunt apply the external dependency? (y/n) 

```

Fixes #78.

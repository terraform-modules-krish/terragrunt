# Fix how Terragrunt checks for remote state initialization

**brikis98** commented *Oct 5, 2017*

Originally, Terragrunt would only initialize remote state if remote
state wasn’t initialized at all or if the config has changed. Now it
will also query each “initializer” to see if it needs initialization.
The only initializer we have right now is the one for S3, and it will
now return true if either the configured S3 bucket or DynamoDB table
don’t exist. I believe this will fix #229.

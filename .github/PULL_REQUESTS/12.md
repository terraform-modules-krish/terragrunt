# Explicitly mention iam:GetUser permission in README.

**josh-padnick** commented *Jun 30, 2016*

While setting up terragrunt in CircleCI, my build failed because the `iam:GetUser` permission was missing, but the docs didn't mention it. I believe this is the only doc file that needs updating, but please let me know if there are others.

Good catch. Changes LGTM. That happened after switching from *nix username to IAM username.

Great. Let me validate that this change is sufficient, and then I'll merge. Note that in the terraform template, I had to escape the IAM Policy variable with `$${aws:username}` so Terraform didn't get confused.

Interestingly, the IAM Policy variable expression `arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT-ID-WITHOUT-HYPHENS:user/${aws:username}` didn't work, despite that AWS docs indicate it should. So I reverted to `*` for now.

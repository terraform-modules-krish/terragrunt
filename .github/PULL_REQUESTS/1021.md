What do you think about "terragrunt-read-config" instead? This would be right before and after terragrunt initialize and finish loading terragrunt configurations. In this case, only the after_hook will mattter.

An `after_hook` for `terragrunt-read-config` feels slightly awkward to me for this use case (an "after" hook whos purpose is to be the before hook for everything else). However, with that said, it is very clear and predictable when it will fire, and is likely to be stable going forward so I think that works for me!

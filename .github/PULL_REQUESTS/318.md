# remote: Check whether input is a TTY before prompting

**kevinburke** commented *Oct 13, 2017*

Add a new CanAcceptPrompt API for determining whether the user can
type in things to send to the running process. If the user cannot do
that, exit with an error immediately, rather than hanging forever.

I haven't checked whether this code is used in other parts of the
program, but if so we should probably update those as well.

Fixes #317.

This is definitely a nifty way of checking for a prompt, but it also breaks the interactive experience for human CLI users. Let's resolve #317 and perhaps then we can revisit this.

I'm a little confused. If a human is using the CLI, terminal.IsTerminal will return true, and we'll skip the if branch. If there's no TTY hooked up to stdin, terminal.IsTerminal will return false and you'll get an error.

Ah, that's my mistake. Thanks for clarifying.

This is blocked on #335 (and I guess #336).

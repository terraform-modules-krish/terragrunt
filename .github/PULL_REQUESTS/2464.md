# isRetryable also checks the stdout

**leighpascoe** commented *Feb 22, 2023*


## Description

Fixes #2462

When retryable_errors are used, with the `-json` flag enabled, Terraform will only return output to `stdout` and not `stderr`. `isRetryable` would not find any error matches because it would only check the contents of `stderr`. This fix adds code to also check the `stdout` for a match.
Added tests for the different cases of the `isRetryable`

## TODOs

Read the [Gruntwork contribution guidelines](https://gruntwork.notion.site/Gruntwork-Coding-Methodology-02fdcd6e4b004e818553684760bf691e).

- [x] Update the docs.
- [x] Run the relevant tests successfully, including pre-commit checks.
- [x] Include release notes. If this PR is backward incompatible, include a migration guide.

## Release Notes (draft)

Fixes retryable errors when `-json` flag is enabled

Thanks for this! Makes things easier. I ran into a similar issue when trying to get terragrunt to recognize this retryable error: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/2276

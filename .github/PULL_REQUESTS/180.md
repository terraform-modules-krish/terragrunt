# Add basic support for minimum version number check

**brikis98** commented *Apr 23, 2017*

This is a fix for #172. 

This PR updates Terragrunt to check that a minimum version of Terraform is installed. For now, this is hard-coded to `v0.9.3`. 

In the future, we could make this configurable. That said, Terraform has its own [required_version](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/terraform.html) support, so perhaps more fine-grained control should be specified in the `.tf` files themselves.

> What if there's a regression in t0.9.3 so that some users want to use t0.9.2 or lower? It may be worth either adding a flag that disables this check or better yet, allowing a custom flag to be specified by the user to avoid this admittedly rare situation.

Yea, I suspect we'll eventually add the ability to specify minimum Terraform and Terragrunt versions directly in the Terragrunt configuration in `terraform.tfvars`. Not sure it's a high enough priority right now.

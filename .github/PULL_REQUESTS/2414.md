## Description

Needed by https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/2415

Update `parseMultiStringArg` to parse multiple successive values for an argument 
e.g. `--foo "VALUE_A" "VALUE_B" --foo "VALUE_C"`.

This is would be useful for a future PR to permit accepting multiple files for `hclfmt`.

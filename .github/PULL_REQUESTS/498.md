# Add minimum IAM policy permissions example

**shoekstra** commented *Jul 1, 2018*

For a more restrictive policy where you may have multiple terragrunt
repos storing their state files in a single bucket and using a single
table for state locking, you still want to limit what parts of the
bucket can be modified.

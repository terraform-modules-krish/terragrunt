# Add ability to assume an IAM role

**brikis98** commented *Oct 18, 2017*

In #322, I added the ability for Terragrunt to assume an IAM role specified in the S3 backend configuration. In this PR, Iâ€™m adding first-class support to Terragrunt so it can assume an IAM for use not only with the backend configuration, but with Terraform itself. 

See the motivation section in the README for why this addition is useful.

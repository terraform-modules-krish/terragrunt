# Update aws-provider-patch to support nested attributes

**brikis98** commented *Oct 15, 2020*

I have come across yet another `import` bug with Terraform. The [original one](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/13018) prompted us to add the `aws-provider-patch` command. The [new one](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26211), which is the motivation for this PR, requires that the `aws-provider-patch` command can override not only top-level attributes in the `provider` block, but also attributes nested within blocks within the `provider` block, such as a `role_arn` within an `assume_role` block. This PR allows you to specify these nested attributes using a "dot" notation: e.g., `--terragrunt-override-attr assume_role.role_arn=""`.

# fix(aws_helper): make sure AWS SSO shared profiles are considered by default

**stevie-** commented *May 25, 2021*

This fixes https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1669 

Corresponding  docs https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/session/ 

```txt
Sessions options from Shared Config

By default NewSession will only load credentials from the shared credentials file (~/.aws/credentials). If the AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG environment variable is set to a truthy value the Session will be created from the configuration values from the shared config (~/.aws/config) and shared credentials (~/.aws/credentials) files. Using the NewSessionWithOptions with SharedConfigState set to SharedConfigEnable will create the session as if the AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG environment variable was set.
```

----
I wonder why CreateAwsSession() is **not** used to create all boto.sessions.

@yorinasub17 I think you looked at this code recently and may have more context. Any reason not to create all AWS sessions through a single, consistent method?

I think we should, but it might be an involved refactor to ensure all the variables it needs are available. I think that should be handled as a separate PR from this one.

Filed https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1692 to track this.

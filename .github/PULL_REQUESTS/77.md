# Add environment variable support to .terragrunt

**josesa** commented *Dec 17, 2016*

Granted, might not be that useful feature for everyone but it was handy for me in the specific context where I use terraform.

Also, my first time with playing around with go. Nice features in a language.

Thanks for the PR!

Before diving into the code, could you explain the use case for this feature? 

One of the goals with Terragrunt was to make it as declarative as possible, to prevent mistakes like forgetting to configure remote state storage. If the remote state storage depends on an environment variable, rather than the contents of a file, you are more likely to make a mistake. 

I'm curious how you're using Terragrunt where you may need to dynamically change these values.

Is just a way to easily test terraform changes without breaking a production environment.

We use terraform with prefix variables in our resources names to test environment changes before applying them to production. We use terraform variables and environment variables for manage these.

```bash
TF_VAR_prefix=test terraform apply
```
This means that we can create a truly copy of our live environment for testing purposed without having to change any of the code and accidentally overwriting our production `tfstate`. We iterate on a `test|development` environment (with an independent `tfstate` stored in S3) and when happy, we change to `production`.

Is possible to use completely different configuration files but we found it to be more error prone and easier to leave something behind or even not being 100% sure which environment was being affected. 
Before `terragrunt` we used wrapper scripts that ensure that the correct remote file was configured but it was not that clear. `terragrunt` makes it much easier to maintain but I just missed this feature of having multiple environments for not having to commit the file with the production setup and accidentally destroying its `tfstate` file when doing experimental changes in our parallel setup.

But I also see that is quite limited to the use case and that might be weird for a lot of people. For example, I considered not having a default and instead just break if the variable is not defined to prevent accidental overwrites.

Making it easier to use Terraform and Terragrunt with multiple environments is something we've been thinking about a lot. We have some ideas about how to do it, but are still coming up with a good design. I'd like to learn more about your env-var based approach. I'm also curious how it compares with the [approach recommended by Kief Morris](https://medium.com/@kief/https-medium-com-kief-using-pipelines-to-manage-environments-with-infrastructure-as-code-b37285a1cbf5).

Also, one other question: don't you have to set different variables for each environment? E.g. different VPC IDs, IPs, DNS entries, AMI IDs, etc? If so, are you managing those through environment variables too?

@brikis98 Yes. We use terraform variables for that

Here is a simple example: 
```hcl
/*************************
  ElastiCache Production
************************ */
resource "aws_elasticache_cluster" "production-cache" {
  cluster_id = "${var.prefix}-${var.application["name"]}-prod"

  # General Config
  engine               = "redis"
  num_cache_nodes      = 1
  parameter_group_name = "default.redis3.2"

  # Instance Config
  node_type = "${var.cache["instance_type"]}"

  # Network
  port               = 6379
  subnet_group_name  = "${aws_elasticache_subnet_group.cache.name}"
  security_group_ids = ["${aws_security_group.instance.id}"]
}
```
`${var.prefix}` is a variable that needs to be set on `tfvars` or (preferably) via ENV variables:

```bash
TF_VAR_prefix="production" terraform  plan
```

Ah, interesting. Env vars strike me as a riskier way of doing this than `.tfvars` files, but I'm not totally against them. Let me look at the code...
***

**josesa** commented *Dec 26, 2016*

Updated according to the suggestions and notes. 

Point 1. is quite interesting and I was also thinking about it. Might be more relevant now that we are pulling all variables and not just the ones that were declared in the file.
Good idea of using the `terragruntOptions` for this. Much better than using the `os` directly.

using `TF_VAR_*` as a filter would reduce this but might not be so clear to the user since we are not really getting `terraform` variables.
Maybe 
 - put a note on the documentation to use the full format if one wants to reuse?
 - change the function name to `get_env_tf_var("variable", "")` for `TF_VAR_variable`.

Regarding the tests I'm still fighting a bit this as is quite new to me.
 - I had to change all imports to local paths since using the `github` modules would of course not load my changed files.

```diff
-       "github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/options"
+       "../options"
```
Is there a better way to do this?

I've been running the tests in each module. Is there a way to run them all with one command?

I guess since we don't have a concrete use case, for now, we shouldn't try to guess and end up violating YAGNI. Let's stick with the approach you have now and add a note to the README to call `get_env("TF_VAR_XXX")` if you're trying to reuse Terraform variables.

> I had to change all imports to local paths since using the github modules would of course not load my changed files.

Go is very picky about the `GOPATH`. If you check this code out into your `GOPATH`, then those imports will work correctly without any changes. For example, my `GOPATH` is `~/source/go` and that code is checked out into `~/source/go/src/github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt`. You can read more about it here: https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-GOPATH_environment_variable

> I've been running the tests in each module. Is there a way to run them all with one command?

Yup, as it says in the README, you can run the following in the root `terragrunt` directory:

```
go test -v $(glide novendor)
```

**brikis98** commented *Dec 27, 2016*

BTW, the code looks good, so if you are able to sort out the import issues and all the tests are passing, let me know, and I'll merge.
***

**brikis98** commented *Jan 9, 2017*

@josesa Were you able to resolve the import issues and get all tests to pass?
***

**josesa** commented *Jan 11, 2017*

@brikis98 Not yet, I have been on vacations with limited internet connection. For sure until the weekend.
***

**josesa** commented *Jan 12, 2017*

@brikis98 Fixed the imports and run the tests. One of them is failing, (but is failing on master for me as well)

This is the failing test:
http://pastebin.com/yfeqHVND

And all of them them:

Make sure you pull in the latest version of master and re-run. I believe the test failure you're seeing was fixed with this commit: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/commit/559f20340f5d35d91787ad2296e8be81468f595a

**josesa** commented *Jan 12, 2017*

You are right. Somehow I didn't rebase it correctly.
Now they are passing 🎉 :

I just created a new release: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.9.1. If the build passes, the new binaries will show up there shortly.

# Add Windows test job 

**zackproser** commented *Aug 16, 2021*

These changes add a Windows test job that:
- Installs Golang 
- Installs Terraform  
- Runs our Go tests 

Issues: 
- Go tests run, but the test step hangs indefinitely at a certain point with no output or errors. Go test timeouts and circleci output timeouts are currently set to 45 minutes. Need to figure out what exactly the step is waiting on.

Thoughts: do we want to extract these functions into a central helper module, following the pattern of `terraform-aws-ci` and the `gruntwork-module-circleci-helpers`, or is that better left to a future optimization?

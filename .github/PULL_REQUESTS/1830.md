# Don't link build->deploy with test

**yorinasub17** commented *Sep 28, 2021*

We have a few flaky tests that fail occasionally. This isn't much of a concern during PR stage, but it causes issues during releases where it stops the binary from being built + uploaded.

This PR updates the workflow so that the `build` and `deploy` steps happen regardless of test failure.

Permanent fix for https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1829

Thanks for review! Merging this in now - hopefully this stabilizes our asset release pipeline.

# Terragrunt will now create remote state S3 bucket if it doesn't exist

**brikis98** commented *Nov 22, 2016*

Iâ€™ve also updated the integration test to use this functionality so the
S3 bucket we use at test time is not hard-coded.

Fixes #35 and #43.

I also worked around a bug/limitation in urfave CLI where command-line flags passed in after the name of a command (e.g. `terragrunt apply --foo`) are not parsed, at all.

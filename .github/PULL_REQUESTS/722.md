# WIP: Improve *-all error message output

**msvechla** commented *Jun 3, 2019*

Hi all, 

Thanks for this awesome project, we are using it in production with 50+ AWS accounts in our two organizations every day!

This PR aims to improve the readability of the `*-all` error messages. With our huge codebases, it can get really hard to find a small module, which errors out during a big `apply-all` run. The PR tries to improve this, by printing the root-cause error messages at the end of the execution run. Root-cause in this case means all module errors, excluding dependency errors.

Please let me know if you have any suggestions to improve this further.
<br />

I know using global variables is probably not the best way to achieve this, but I tried it earlier by incorporating the variables into the `Stack` struct, but this made everything way more complicated, so I decided to go for readability.

Also the go channel is currently not really needed, but might improve readability and future refactoring, as the concurrency is now explicitly coded.

Do you have any suggestions for unit tests?

Nice, thanks for the PR! Could you share an example of what the log output will look like now (a small snippet, not the whole thing, of course)?

Please note that we're going to hold off on merging anything until #466 is resolved, as that's very high priority. Once that one is in, please pull the latest from master, and give us a ping to review.

@brikis98 I just rebased from master and pushed again.

The output currently looks like this: At the end of the exuction of an `*-all` command, we see the following summary when errors occurred. The output with terraform > v0.12 is a little bit more verbose now, as it prints an additional warning:

> Warning: Skipping backend initialization pending configuration upgrade

Still, having all errors and the related modules printed at the end of the runner is a great benefit when running large executions. Please let me know what you think.

Thanks for the feedback @brikis98! 

I did some refactoring and removed the channels. For sure I will add tests once this last bit is resolved. 

Do you have any idea why I still get the `terraform init` output, even though I only print the stderr stream at the end? As far as I know the `terraform init` messages should be on the stdout stream.

E.g. this is my current Error output at the end:

```

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

Not sure I follow. You seem to be getting an error about a missing variable. What does stdout or stderr have to do with it?
***

**msvechla** commented *Jul 1, 2019*

What I posted is the new detailed output of my change. The idea is to have a summary of all module errors including their error messages (stderr) at the end of the execution. If you check out https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/722/files#diff-86e77ee353cd3bacb4a1f0c492bf9e2cR169 of my change, you can see that I am capturing the stderr and outputting it in the `collectErrors()` method: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/722/files#diff-86e77ee353cd3bacb4a1f0c492bf9e2cR186.

Somehow the `terraform init` code shows up in the `stderr` stream, even though when I do a normal terraform run, it is printed to `stdout`.

So my question would be, if you have any idea why the `terraform init` output shows up in `stderr.

Ohhhh, I gotcha, thx for providing the context 😁 

The behavior you're seeing is probably from this: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/cli/cli_app.go#L606-L607
***

**msvechla** commented *Jul 2, 2019*

Yep, thats it, thanks a lot for pointing me in the right direction!

In the comment [here](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/cli/cli_app.go#L606-L607) it says:

> Don't pollute stdout with the stdout from Auto Init

So I assume it will not be a big issue moving this back to stdout, or what was the reasoning behind this?

Also I found [this part](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/722/commits/e0aafd615c63f5a35c955f253db1386808b08c54#diff-f95053933eada5dadd7191beb755d841L196) where the logger is set by default to stderr, which also leads to some pollution of my error output.

I now adjusted both parts and now the detailed error output is clean. Can you think of any issues these changes could cause from the top of your head? Of course I will run the tests to make sure there are no obvious issues.

**brikis98** commented *Jul 2, 2019*

> Can you think of any issues these changes could cause from the top of your head?

Yes. Consider someone running the following:

```
url=$(terragrunt output url)
```

They expect that the value of the output variable `url`, and _only_ that value, is written to `stdout`. If the auto init functionality writes to `stdout`, then that assumption will break. Hence, we redirect auto init output to `stderr`. 

In general, if you run `terragrunt <cmd>`, where `<cmd>` is any standard Terraform command, what's written to `stdout` should be the same as if you had run `terraform <cmd>` directly.
***

**msvechla** commented *Jul 2, 2019*

Thanks for clarifying, of course that makes perfect sense.

In this case we would either have to live with the more verbose detailed error message at the end of the execution, or I would have to come up with some way of extracting the auto-init output from the detailed error message.

I will look into it again.
***

**msvechla** commented *Jul 2, 2019*

Alright, I made it work by saving the `auto-init` output and extracting it from the detailed error messages.

The current detailed error messages now look like this:

```

What do you think? Should we also make this output optional or use it by default?
***

**brikis98** commented *Jul 6, 2019*

So that's the output you see at the end of an `xxx-all` call?

If so, I think that looks like a terrific improvement. I assume those errors are grouped by module?
***

**msvechla** commented *Jul 6, 2019*

Yep, that is correct. As the `collectErrrors()` method loops over all running modules, this automatically groups all the errors by module.

I will try and add some tests now. 
***

**msvechla** commented *Jul 6, 2019*

Alright, I just added module and integration tests. Do you have further improvement suggestions?
***

**msvechla** commented *Jul 9, 2019*

I did some refactoring to separate the normal and detailed errors in the `MultiError` struct. This also fixed problems with some of the tests. Do you have any further input @brikis98?
***

**brikis98** commented *Jul 11, 2019*

Apologies for the delay! Been completely buried. I really appreciate this PR and will try to review this as soon as I can. 🍺

**msvechla** commented *Jul 11, 2019*

Don't worry, take your time! Just get back to me when you can 👍

# update hclfmt documentation and cli command usage text

This PR references the #1528

As mentioned in the @brikis98 and @ChristophShyper comments:

https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1528#issuecomment-785781103

[https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1528#issuecomment-857641641](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1528#issuecomment-857641641)

The `terragrunt hclfmt` documentation is outdated.

The documented behavior says that just `terragrunt.hcl` files will be formatted/checked and this information is wrong, since that all hcl files will be formatted/checked with the `terragrunt hclfmt`

I've done the update of documentation and cli command usage text and some typo fixes and added the test scenario to format other hcl files besides the terragrunt.hcl

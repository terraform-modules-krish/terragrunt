# Skip the cache dir entirely when finding configs

Rather than searching each path that might exist below the
`.terragrunt-cache` directory, skip it entirely speeding up the process.

This is semi-related to https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1253.

@brikis98 There is actually already some logic and tests to skip the `.terragrunt-cache` directories.

https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/config/config.go#L303-L306

The problem is that `*-all` commands still traverse every file in cache directories looking for configs and be quite slow instead of just skipping the directories entirely and not looking at everything beneath them. I thought about restructuring things a bit to remove the redundancy I'm adding but I'm not familiar with the code base enough to do that reshuffling confidently so open to suggestions.

So this is solely a perf improvement, not a fix for a bug? If so, I'm curiouos, how much of a perf improvement are we talking? How many files is this scanning and is the difference in speed measurable here?

Yes, that is correct. It is certainly noticeable and measurable with my setup where I'm running on a laptop and have a lot of files in those cache directories. Obviously, it will vary based on any number of factors when it comes to people's setups.

Oh, wait, could you pull in  the latest from `master` first?

**awiddersheim** commented *Nov 18, 2020*

@brikis98 Yup! Rebased.
***

**brikis98** commented *Nov 18, 2020*

OK, running tests now.

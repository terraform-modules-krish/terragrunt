# Parse include block first so include-specific functions work in other blocks of child config

**apottere** commented *Jun 17, 2019*

Before this change `path_relative_to_include`, `path_relative_from_include`, and `get_parent_terragrunt_dir` were all `"."` when called from the child config.  This is because the whole config is parsed at once, and there was no way to know the value of the `include` block before parsing.

This change splits parsing up so that `include` is parsed first, and then the rest of the config is parsed.  This allows us to use the three functions above in the child config in other areas.

Test before changes, passes with changes:
```

1. Done.
2. I ran the tests in `/config`, `/configstack`, and `/cli`, but I'm unable to run all the tests because I don't have a sandbox aws account to use.

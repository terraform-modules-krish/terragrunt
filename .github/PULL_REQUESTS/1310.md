# Migrate RFC and upgrade guides

**yorinasub17** commented *Aug 23, 2020*

This PR removes the confusing `_docs` folder at the top level and rolls in the migration guides and RFC docs to the terragrunt website.

Note that I opted to remove the Terragrunt 0.12.x migration guide in the process given that it is too old.

Looks great.

Super minor NIT: any way to get "Rfc" to show as "RFC?" Don't spend more than 3 min on it 😁

Thanks for review! Merging this in now.

I already spent 15 mins trying to get it to look correct and gave up, so will leave it as that 😅

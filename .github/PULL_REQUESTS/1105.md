# Upgrade hclfmt (+alpha: see description)

**yorinasub17** commented *Mar 28, 2020*

This addresses https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1092, where the hcl2 library was too old, and thus it did not include the fix for handling heredoc syntax correctly.

However, in order to update to the latest hcl2 version, we needed to switch to `hashicorp/hcl/v2` as the `hcl2` repo is now archived and merged into the mainstream `hcl` repo. The problem was that this did not work too well with `dep`, and so I also took this chance to update to using go modules.

Note that in the process, all the packages were updated to the latest version that supports all the imports used throughout this repo (this is done automatically when you do `go mod tidy` without explicit version locking). This includes:

- `terraform`: 0.12.9 => 0.12.24
- `aws-sdk-go`: 1.25.4 => 1.29.34
- `go-getter`: 1.3.0 => 1.4.2

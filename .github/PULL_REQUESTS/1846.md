# #1842 Redirect and cache modules output in case of plan command

**denis256** commented *Oct 4, 2021*

Updated handling of "plan" to pass error stream that cache output inside and redirects to console(for interactive mode), cached data later is used to print plan summary

Example usage on https://github.com/dkossako/infra-ref :
```
$ cd prod
$ terragrunt run-all plan

ERRO[0000] Module /tmp/infra-ref/prod/_global/_global/monitoring/budget has finished with an error: 1 error occurred:
        * stat /mnt/panda/cloudpanda.io/terraform-aws-budget: no such file or directory
  prefix=[/tmp/infra-ref/prod/_global/_global/monitoring/budget] 
Remote state S3 bucket terraform-state-cpanda does not exist or you don't have permissions to access it. Would you like Terragrunt to create it? (y/n) 

```

This actually breaks the links in the jekyll site. Not sure how to fix this so I'll bring it up with the team

Closing this PR. Spoke with the team and we decided this is a very low priority fix since jekyll uses templates. We might not be able to do anything about it. Also the probability of a user transversing so deep into the tree such that they hit this error is very low.

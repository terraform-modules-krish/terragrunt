# Fix two bugs: recursive dependencies, concurrent S3 errors

**brikis98** commented *Oct 27, 2017*

This PR fixes two bugs:

1. Terragrunt was not properly loading recursive dependencies of external modules. E.g., if module A depended on module B, where B was outside of the current folder structure, and B depended on C, Terragrunt would throw an error upon finding C. I added a new failing test case to repro this issue and this PR fixes the failure.

1. While fixing the above, I triggered another issue where `xxx-all` methods would try to create the same S3 bucket in parallel, leading to “operation in progress” style errors that Terragrunt wasn’t handling correctly.

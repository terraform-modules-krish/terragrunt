# Enable all public access blocking

**yorinasub17** commented *Jul 23, 2019*

Based on investigation for https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/795, it turns out we have a few more safety valves we can enable to ensure no public access is granted to the state files and bucket created by terragrunt.

You can read more about this feature in S3 in the official docs: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-control-block-public-access.html

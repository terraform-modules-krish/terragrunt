# Fix #1124

**yorinasub17** commented *Apr 10, 2020*

This fixes the bug reported in #1124. The main issue is that the `Source` attribute isn't updated in the context of the target config when retrieving the dependency, which causes it to continue to use the source value of the dependent config.

To fix this, we recompute the `Source` on the target config when it is set. Note that I had to shuffle the functions around to avoid a circular dependency.

NOTE: As a test to ensure the regression test is actually testing the bug, see the failure on e39bdad where the new test fails without any changes, and then it passes in c960eca without any modifications to the test.

Thanks for the review! Merging this in as a bugfix for the reporter, since right now it breaks usage of `--terragrunt-source` with dependencies without any workaround. This at least enables a path forward.

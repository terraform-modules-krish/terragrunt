# configValuesEqual should have no side effects

**yorinasub17** commented *Oct 22, 2020*

I have no idea how this was working before, but @ina-stoyanova and @zackproser found a bug in terragrunt where we were stripping out the terragrunt only config vals before parsing out the extended s3 config object.

Digging in, I found out that this was because we were stripping that out in the `configValuesEqual` function using `delete`. I fixed this by removing the side effect from the equals function.

NOTE: I attempted to create a regression test for this, but I had difficulty reproducing the behavior in a test environment. I was able to repro this behavior, but it is not exactly clear when it happens because it relies on `.terragrunt-cache` already having been init with an s3 bucket AND it is creating a new s3 bucket.

Thanks for review!

I decided to add in the regression test anyway, even though it doesn't properly demonstrate the broken behavior, because at least it gives me confident that the code did not depend on the manipulation in `configValuesEqual` for the happy path (and thus this refactoring is legit).

... So needs another review please!

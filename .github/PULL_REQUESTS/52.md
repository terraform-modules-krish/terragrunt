LGTM, thank you! Merging now.

I just created a new release: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.1.4. Assuming the tests pass, the new binaries will show up at that URL in a few minutes.

Haha, the build, of course, failed. The cause was that Terraform has been changing their version numbers back and forth, so the build failed to download the latest Terraform binary. I just committed a fix and recreated the v0.1.4 release. Hopefully, in a few more minutes, the new binaries will be there :)

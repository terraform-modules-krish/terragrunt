# Add get_repo_root() built-in

**andreykaipov** commented *Feb 27, 2022*

A common pattern I've found myself repeating across our Terragrunt modules is referring to the repo root instead of boggling my head around relative paths.

For example, in the parent:
```hcl
locals {
  root = run_cmd("--terragrunt-quiet", "git", "rev-parse", "--show-toplevel")
}
```

In the child:
```hcl
include "root" {
  expose = true
  path   = find_in_parent_folders()
}

locals {
  something = "${include.root.locals.root}/some/config.yml"
}
```

While `get_parent_terragrunt_dir()` might be enough if our parent `terragrunt.hcl` is also at the root of the repo, as soon as one wants to nest their Terragrunt configuration inside of an `infra` directory or similar, it won't be enough.

I saw https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1954 was merged in but it was only for relative paths (plus it has a few limitations documented in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/2026). Having a built-in function to get the absolute path equivalent would be a nice to have. The above example would now look like:

In the parent:
```hcl
locals {}
```

In the child:
```hcl
include "root" {
  path   = find_in_parent_folders()
}

locals {
  something = "${get_repo_root()}/some/config.yml"
}
```

Please lemme know if y'all are open to this change! Thanks.

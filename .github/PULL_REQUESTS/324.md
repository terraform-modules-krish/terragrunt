# Add validate-all command

**brikis98** commented *Oct 19, 2017*

This PR adds a `validate-all` command that runs `terraform validate` on each module that is a child of the current directory. This is a nice way to not only validate that your Terraform code is valid, but also that the `dependencies` youâ€™ve defined in your Terragrunt configurations are valid.

# Set AWS credentials in the environment so go-getter can use them

**jbergknoff-rival** commented *Jul 3, 2019*

In going from 0.18.7 to 0.19.0, the method for downloading Terraform sources changed from `terraform init` to the hashicorp/go-getter library. This introduces a regression where an artifact in S3 can no longer be fetched using an assumed role.

.ssh/config
```
[ops]
aws_access_key_id=...
aws_secret_access_key=...
```

This is likely actually an issue with the go-getter library not properly handling AWS credentials, but the change in this PR is a lower effort fix. I've tested that this fixes the issue in my setup. I've also tested separately that having Terragrunt pull in https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter/pull/185 (which looks related) does not fix my issue.

I was going through the terragrunt code yesterday and found very good comments in it, explaining why  something was done. So for this, I would add a note as well, something like "it's for go-getter not doing the auth right".

Just my 2 cents.

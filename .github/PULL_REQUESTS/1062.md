# Make include dirs consistent when dependencies are involved

**yorinasub17** commented *Feb 20, 2020*

This PR addresses the issue reported in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1041.

Specifically:

- There was a bug in the behavior of `include-dir` where the order in which modules were added to the stack changed if dependencies would be included or not. The main issue stemmed from the fact that we immediately included dependencies when processing included directories. The included dependency could be undone if that module appeared later in the for loop and it resided outside the included dirs. This PR fixes that by handling dependencies in a second loop.

- Add a new flag `--terragrunt-strict-include` which will ignore dependencies when processing include dir.

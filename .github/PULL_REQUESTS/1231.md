Thanks for the review! I updated the PR to include review suggestions.

We also need to include this new attribute in https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/

Added a reference to the new attribute to the "Configuration Blocks and Attributes" doc page and squashed everything into a single commit. This is now ready for review.

Yes, it's in the PR #1232. I can merged them together if that is preferred?

Yea, you can either (a) merge them together and open a single PR, orÂ (b) create a short-lived feature branch and open these PRs against it, rather than `master`, and then merge the feature branch to `master` at the end.

Makes sense! I'll add this doc change to the PR #1232 and close this PR then.

Roger, thx!

Doc changes now live in #1232. Closing this.

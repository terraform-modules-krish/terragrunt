# fix: reorg cli arguments

**zot24** commented *Aug 31, 2019*

Related to https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/454

This fix follows the recommendation mentioned in this comment https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/454#issuecomment-450831599 where we reorganize the hardcoded options `-input=false -auto-approve` to avoid the following error:

```
Running command: terraform apply terraform.tfplan -input=false -auto-approve
Too many command line arguments. Configuration path expected.
```

So we end instead with the following order in the command

```
terraform apply -input=false -auto-approve terraform.tfplan
```

Which follows the `terraform` help usage for the apply command `Usage: terraform apply [options] [DIR-OR-PLAN]`

This is the requested `gist` with the result of running the tests: https://gist.github.com/zot24/b6b2d90ba1b5b1008602dc0b8b031809 however there are a bunch of failing test that I don't see how those might be related with these changes :/ if someone can point me out in the right direction here if you thing they are I'll be happy to go over those

**Note:** there is a minor change as well added to this PR which is the swap of `-force` by `-auto-approve` on the `destroy` command as it will be deprecated in future versions of `terraform` as recommended on `help`

```
  -force                 Deprecated: same as auto-approve.
```

I'm also bumping into that issue.

Is there a real need of injecting these options `-input=false -auto-approve` automatically when running `apply-all`.

In my opinion, this should be a choice of the user (via `extra_arguments`) and not imposed silently by terragrunt.

Does it make sense ?

I'm going to close this as I won't have time to look into it however I agree with @yves-del-medico and not enforcing this could be a good solution and let that to the user

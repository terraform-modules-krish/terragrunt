# Bug/exit status on modules

**jocgir** commented *Apr 27, 2017*

Here is a fix to better handle the exit code when using xxx-all command. I simply added an interface to get the exit code and implemented it in `DependencyFinishedWithError` and `MultiError`.

That does not solve totally the problem with `terraform plan -detailed-exitcode` since if terraform detects changes on dependencies, terragrunt will simply not process the dependants. But the messages are easy to understand and the final result code is the good one.

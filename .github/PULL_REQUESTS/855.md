# Fix #854: Dependency TerragruntOptions was not updated in cycle check

**yorinasub17** commented *Sep 6, 2019*

This fixes the bug identified in #854. Specifically, the cycle logic was not properly updating `TerragruntOptions.TerragruntConfigPath` each time it recursed through the dependencies. This caused the subsequent parsing of `include` blocks to fail because it was appending the path to the wrong reference point.

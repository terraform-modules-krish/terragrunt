# Option for less verbose output

**amnk** commented *Jan 23, 2021*

This moves majority of Terragrunt's output to DEBUG level, and sets
default output mode to ERROR. The idea is that in default run user should
see much less output.

Closes: gruntwork-io/terragrunt#432

Looks like the precommit hooks failed. Could you run `go fmt` on your code?

https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1521/ is merged now! Going to merge this in so I can work on the merge conflict in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1520 . That said, I don't quite have time to look into the details of this branch at this moment, so will defer the release to @brikis98 (otherwise I don't know what to put in the release notes).

# Option to suppress output of run_cmd() for sensitive commands

**jessebye** commented *Jul 16, 2019*

Adds an option to suppress the output of `run_cmd()` for sensitive commands. In our case, we're encrypting some values with `sops` and then using `run_cmd()` to decrypt them and pass them in to terraform.

To use this option, the first argument passed to `run_cmd()` should be `--terragrunt-quiet`.

More details in the README updates.

@brikis98 this is the feature we discussed via Slack 😁 tests are passing, and tested on some of our terraform code successfully!

# Refactoring cli related code

**levkohimins** commented *Jun 16, 2023*

<!-- Prepend '[WIP]' to the title if this PR is still a work-in-progress. Remove it when it is ready for review! -->

## Description

Refactoring CLI related code with a CLI package implementation similar to `github.com/urfave/cli`, but with the main difference, it does not return an error if the flag or command is not found, instead returns them as argument values. This also affected the following:
1. Structuring flags and commands
1. Automatic CLI Help Generation
1. Splitted `RunTerragrunt` code by commands
1. Get rid of repetitive code
1. Better code readability


Fixes #2599

Thank you for the review and sorry for such the huge PR!

> 1. What has changed about logging? In particular, has anything changed about what gets written to `stdout` on any command? TG is often used in scripts and people parse `stdout` carefully.

Only falg `--terragrunt-no-color` has been added to disable terragrunt colors (to solve this issue https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/2116
any), no other changes affecting log output have been made.

> 2. What has changed about the CLI flags or env vars TG expects? I saw some env vars that looked like backward incompatible changes.

There were three flags that disabled some features, but their env vars behavior was the opposite:

```
--terragrunt-no-auto-init TERRAGRUNT_AUTO_INIT
--terragrunt-no-auto-retry TERRAGRUNT_AUTO_RETRY
--terragrunt-no-auto-approve TERRAGRUNT_AUTO_APPROVE
```
and these env vars only work with `false` value, for example `TERRAGRUNT_AUTO_INIT=true` does do nothing.

I renamed env vars and made their behavior more logical:
```
--terragrunt-no-auto-init TERRAGRUNT_NO_AUTO_INIT
--terragrunt-no-auto-retry TERRAGRUNT_NO_AUTO_RETRY
--terragrunt-no-auto-approve TERRAGRUNT_NO_AUTO_APPROVE
```

at the same time I left these old env variables for backwards compatibility. For example, both these env variables:

`TERRAGRUNT_AUTO_INIT=false`
`TERRAGRUNT_NO_AUTO_INIT=true`

are available and their behavior is identical. By the way, now all env variables are also displayed in the help https://share.getcloudapp.com/NQupYyzz


> 3. Has anything changed in CLI flag parsing? Are we parsing differently than before? E.g., Different flag order? Different usage of `-xxx` versus `--xxx`?

Yes, and for the better. Now it doesn't matter to use one hyphen or two. The principle is as follows, if the flag is not registered in terragrant, then it is considered as a terraform flag.
Of cource full backward compatibility. I used the `flag` package for parsing https://pkg.go.dev/flag#hdr-Command_line_flag_syntax

Noticed that build version is reported differently when terragrunt is built locally:
master branch
```
$ make terragrunt
set -xe ;\
vtag_maybe_extra=$(git describe --tags --abbrev=12 --dirty --broken) ;\
go build -o terragrunt -ldflags "-X main.VERSION=${vtag_maybe_extra}" .
++ git describe --tags --abbrev=12 --dirty --broken
+ vtag_maybe_extra=v0.48.6
+ go build -o terragrunt -ldflags '-X main.VERSION=v0.48.6' .

$ ./terragrunt --version
terragrunt version v0.48.6

```

feature/refactoring-cli-related-code branch
```
$ make terragrunt
set -xe ;\
vtag_maybe_extra=$(git describe --tags --abbrev=12 --dirty --broken) ;\
go build -o terragrunt -ldflags "-X main.VERSION=${vtag_maybe_extra}" .
++ git describe --tags --abbrev=12 --dirty --broken
+ vtag_maybe_extra=v0.48.5-94-g04ddc2eea20e
+ go build -o terragrunt -ldflags '-X main.VERSION=v0.48.5-94-g04ddc2eea20e' .

$ ./terragrunt --version
terragrunt version latest

```

This was also changed, please take a look at `.circleci/config.yml` file.  The new implementation looks like this 
```shell
... -ldflags="-X github.com/gruntwork-io/go-commons/version.Version=${vtag_maybe_extra} -extldflags '-static'"
```

This is a more advanced approach, also used in `repo-copier` and `terraform-aws-lambda`.

Thank you for your review! You helped me improve the code where I was lazy :) 

> (Oh, and there is some test failure? Make sure test pass before merge.)

No, everything is clean. 
BTW I have fixed one very unpleasant bug in the integration tests. Before the refactoring, it appeared very rarely, and just restarting the CircleCi job was enough, but after that, this bug became permanent. (@denis256 FYI)

Noticed another difference:
https://github.com/denis256/terragrunt-tests/tree/master/output-module-groups/app

```
$ master-terragrunt output-module-groups
Module:                  /home/denis/projects/gruntwork/terragrunt-tests/output-module-groups/app
External dependency:     /home/denis/projects/gruntwork/terragrunt-tests/output-module-groups/m4
Should Terragrunt apply the external dependency? (y/n) 

$ branch-terragrunt output-module-groups
Module /home/denis/projects/gruntwork/terragrunt-tests/output-module-groups/app depends on module /home/denis/projects/gruntwork/terragrunt-tests/output-module-groups/m4, which is an external dependency outside of the current working directory. Should Terragrunt run this external dependency? Warning, if you say 'yes', Terragrunt will make changes in /home/denis/projects/gruntwork/terragrunt-tests/output-module-groups/m4 as well! (y/n) 

```

Merged with `master`. Now should be the same.

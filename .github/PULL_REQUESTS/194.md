# output-all should process module stack in regular order.

**mrtyler** commented *Apr 26, 2017*

### Repro case

Minimal terraform code is [here](https://github.com/mrtyler/terragrunt-star-all-minimal) but it's just this:

```
### ./base/main.tf
output "base_var" { value = "i am base_var" }

### ./base/terraform.tfvars
terragrunt {}

### ./worker/main.tf
output "worker_var" { value = "i am worker_var" }

### ./worker/terraform.tfvars
terragrunt {
  dependencies {
    paths = ["../base"]
  }
}
```

Here's what happens when I run `terragrunt output-all` against that terraform config using current master:
```
$ go run ~/code/go/src/github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/main.go output-all
[terragrunt] [/Users/tyler/rtf/tg-all] 2017/04/25 22:17:18 Running command: terraform --version
[terragrunt] 2017/04/25 22:17:18 Stack at /Users/tyler/rtf/tg-all:
  => Module /Users/tyler/rtf/tg-all/worker (dependencies: [/Users/tyler/rtf/tg-all/base])
  => Module /Users/tyler/rtf/tg-all/base (dependencies: [])
```

So far so good. `worker` depends on `base`.

```
[terragrunt] [/Users/tyler/rtf/tg-all/base] 2017/04/25 22:17:18 Module /Users/tyler/rtf/tg-all/base must wait for 1 dependencies to finish
[terragrunt] [/Users/tyler/rtf/tg-all/worker] 2017/04/25 22:17:18 Module /Users/tyler/rtf/tg-all/worker must wait for 0 dependencies to finish
```

Hey, that's backwards!

I don't think this behavior is deliberate; I think it was a copy/paste error when `output-all` was introduced (in `df7b6ee9`). The `Output` function was added below `Destroy`, which uses `RunModulesReverseOrder` instead of `RunModules`. Reverse order is correct for `destroy` but not for `output`.

### With the fix

Here's what happens when I run `terragrunt output-all` using the change in this PR:
```
$ go run ~/code/go/src/github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/main.go output-all
...
[terragrunt] [/Users/tyler/rtf/tg-all/base] 2017/04/25 22:21:11 Module /Users/tyler/rtf/tg-all/base must wait for 0 dependencies to finish
[terragrunt] [/Users/tyler/rtf/tg-all/base] 2017/04/25 22:21:11 Running module /Users/tyler/rtf/tg-all/base now
[terragrunt] [/Users/tyler/rtf/tg-all/base] 2017/04/25 22:21:11 Reading Terragrunt config file at /Users/tyler/rtf/tg-all/base/terraform.tfvars
[terragrunt] [/Users/tyler/rtf/tg-all/worker] 2017/04/25 22:21:11 Module /Users/tyler/rtf/tg-all/worker must wait for 1 dependencies to finish
```

### Testing

The test suite passes, but I didn't have to change it. It looks like `output-all` functionality is only covered by `integration_test.go::TestTerragruntOutputAllCommand`, which only verifies that output from each module is returned. I admit I'm not really sure what else to test, though. Arguably this "bug" has no impact since all the outputs are returned even if the order is "wrong". I found the dependency ordering problem while discovering #193.

A couple other notes on terragrunt's test framework (I'm happy to spin off separate issues for these but first I wanted to check if these problems are already known and/or tracked elsewhere):

* `TestNewSignalsForwarderMultiple` seems to be flaky. I observed two failures out of six test runs using `go test -v -parallel 128 $(glide novendor)`:
```
--- FAIL: TestNewSignalsForwarderMultiple (7.54s)
        assertions.go:226: ^M                          ^M       Error Trace:    run_shell_cmd_test.go:121
                ^M      Error:          Not equal:
                ^M                      expected: 10
                ^M                      received: 12
FAIL
FAIL    github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/shell        7.564s
```

* The `go test` process exits 0 even when tests fail (such as the test above). I wouldn't have known about those test failures at all if I hadn't happened to notice them scrolling by.

Ah, good catch! This seems like the right fix. That said, it would be great to update the test to check for ordering explicitly. The [current assertions](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/test/integration_test.go#L157-L161) just use contains. Looping over the output in order would be better, if you have the time for it.

I haven't seen that despite many, many test runs. Please file as a separate issue. What OS are you on?

Also strange! Please file as a separate issue.

I agree that the test should be improved. Making assertions about order seems like a reasonable approach. Let me look into that.

Is improving the test a requirement for getting this PR merged in, or might I be able to convince you to merge this without an improved test if it turns out to be tricky? Just want to understand my options so I can communicate with my team.

I'm still seeing TestNewSignalsForwarderMultiple being flaky. I've opened #196 to track this problem.

I am not able to reproduce the incorrect return codes. Not sure what I saw yesterday. Sorry for the noise.

I improved the test. It fails on master and passes when my fix is applied.

LGTM. Thank you!

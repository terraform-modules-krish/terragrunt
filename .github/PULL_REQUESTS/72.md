I updated the code with your remarks.

The tests are failing, But the parent commit does not pass them either. There are failures related to cli (which I didn't changed) and other changes failing because I can't access a S3 bucket.

The S3 bucket thing is expected. The code actually creates it for you.

The other three errors are probably a silly bug. Out of curiosity, does one of the parent folders of where you have the terragrunt checked out happen to contain a `.terragrunt` file?
***

**mildred** commented *Jan 3, 2017*

None of the parent folders contains a `.terragrunt` file: In the subfolders the list of `.terragrunt` files is in the test directory:

```
./test/fixture/.terragrunt
./test/fixture-include/.terragrunt
./test/fixture-include/qa/my-app/.terragrunt
./test/fixture-lock/.terragrunt
./test/fixture-parent-folders/multiple-terragrunt-in-parents/.terragrunt
./test/fixture-parent-folders/multiple-terragrunt-in-parents/child/.terragrunt
./test/fixture-parent-folders/multiple-terragrunt-in-parents/child/sub-child/.terragrunt
./test/fixture-parent-folders/multiple-terragrunt-in-parents/child/sub-child/sub-sub-child/.terragrunt

./test/fixture-parent-folders/terragrunt-in-root/.terragrunt
./test/fixture-parent-folders/terragrunt-in-root/child/sub-child/sub-sub-child/.terragrunt
```

Hm, AFAIK, tests have been passing consistently in CI and other people's computers recently, so I'm a bit stumped why they would be failing on yours. It seems unlikely to be related to your change, so I'm going to try to merge it in.

**brikis98** commented *Jan 3, 2017*

Looks like the tests passed. I just created a new release and the binaries should be there in a few minutes: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.7.3. Thanks again for the PR!

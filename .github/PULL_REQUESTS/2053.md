# Update inputs.md typo

**rhoboat** commented *Mar 30, 2022*

Can someone please check that the language is correct here? Is it true that `TF_VAR_xxx` will override `inputs`, or is it true that `TF_VAR_xxx` will be overridden by `inputs`? The original language could have implied either one, and I want to fix this precisely because it's confusing.

Value from `TF_VAR_xxx` override value from `inputs`

```
terragrunt apply
...
3
...
```

```
TF_VAR_some_number=666 terragrunt apply
...
666
...
```

Full example in: https://github.com/denis256/terragrunt-tests/tree/master/var-override

In implementation, all values from inputs are transformed to `TF_VAR_xxx` and passed to terraform, but if the variable is already defined - it is not copied

Thanks Denis! Merging now despite test failure, because that is unrelated.

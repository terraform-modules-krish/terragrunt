Wait does `terragrunt plan` really does a lock? I thought it simply checks the S3 bucket and the dynamodb table exist and auto-creates does if not.

As @mechastorm indicated, the `plan` command does not acquire a lock. @mcalhoun Are you seeing something different?

@mcalhoun I'm going to close this per the comments above, but let me know if I'm missing something.

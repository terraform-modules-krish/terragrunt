# Some adjustments to make config_helpers tests pass on Windows.

**jocgir** commented *Apr 24, 2017*

Change getTfVarsDir() to convert result to unix format path (forward ……slash).
Fix test for config_helpers that were not processed correctly on Windows.
Fix Makefile (install hook was not working)

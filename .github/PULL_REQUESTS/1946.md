I investigated the bug of not being able to use the `terraform_binary` value in the dependency file.
In my case, `TerraformPath` didn't have the value set in the dependency file because i run the command with the flag.

```
/usr/local/bin/terragrunt/0.25.1/terragrunt plan --terragrunt-non-interactive -out=tfplan.binary --terragrunt-tfpath /usr/local/bin/terraform/0.13.3/terraform
```

So the `terragruntOptions.TerraformPath` was `/usr/local/bin/terraform/0.13.3/terraform` , and in the if statement it was ignored

Build failed, but it's because of an out of data branch. Once I rebased, it passed so will go ahead and merge this in!

# Skip external dependencies prompt for destroy

**yorinasub17** commented *Oct 13, 2021*

We currently prompt the user by default for confirmation of whether the user wants to include an external dependency in a `run-all` command. However, this prompt is fairly dangerous for `run-all destroy` as it could have disastrous effects.

The workaround we usually suggest is to always pass in `--terragrunt-ignore-external-dependencies`, but that is a hidden flag and operators won't always remember to pass that in.

Alternatively, they can always pass in `--terragrunt-non-interactive`, but then this time you lose the prompt to confirm which modules you want to run destroy on, which is a useful prompt.

Therefore, this PR updates the logic to skip the external dependencies prompt for `run-all destroy`.

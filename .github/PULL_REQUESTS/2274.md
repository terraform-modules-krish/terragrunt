# Share `Env` attributes with `cfgOptions`.

## Description
In #1823, functionality was added to check module dependencies during destroy operations. This included creating [a fresh `TerragruntOptions` object](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1823/files#diff-2ce1e65bb8a23011007dae779c8bacbc45d28560b1bc4e7dc1079f52fd22cf14R504) which, by default, has [an empty map for the `Env` attribute](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/7788a525ab61641211e3f8a127ed53b450e96bc8/options/options.go#L256). This means we're losing all environment variables when checking for dependencies.

Fixes https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/2273.

## Release Notes (draft)

Updated `FindWhereWorkingDirIsIncluded` to include `Env` in the `TerragruntOptions` object for validating module dependencies for destroy operations.

I've verified this change locally with `$ go run main.go destroy --terragrunt-working-dir ...` against my organizations terragrunt configuration. Please let me know if there is more I can do for testing!

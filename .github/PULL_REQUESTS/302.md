The grep test in this PR only examines files matching `**/*.tf` while ignoring `*.tf.json` files.
Both are equally valid places to declare the empty block it wants.

https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/

Across the years I've always declared the (now-required) empty stanza in a `common.tf.json` file.
```
    "terraform": {
        "backend": {
            "s3": {
            }
        }
    },
```
In order to upgrade terragrunt past this change, 
users will need to move that stanza from (`.tf.json`) to (`.tf`) files.

I'm going to try fixing this now.

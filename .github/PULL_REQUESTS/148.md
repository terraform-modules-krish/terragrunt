# Run all source through `gofmt`, add formatting docs and helpers

**fajpunk** commented *Feb 25, 2017*

Addresses https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/129.

Two parts to this PR:
1. Run all of the source through `gofmt`
2. Add docs specifying that all contributions should be `gofmt`ed, and add helper scripts:
    * Makefile target and script to check for formatting
    * Makefile target to format all source
    * Makefile target to install git pre-commit script that will check formatting and stop commits with unformatted files.

The format checker and some of the make targets were taken from the terraform project.

All tests passed when run locally with:
`AWS_PROFILE=terragrunt-test go test -v -parallel 128 $(glide novendor)`

This is the way I've personally dealt with pre-commit hooks.  I'm relatively new to golang, so I figured terraform would be a good place to crib from as to how a big public golang project handles the formatting.  If this is not the way you want to handle either of these things for this project, I'm completely open to anything else; just let me know what you want to do!

I think I added `make fmtcheck` to the `test` section of the CircleCI config.  I'm not too familiar with CircleCI, I assume I just put the command in that list...

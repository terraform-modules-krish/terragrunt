# Add page showing supported terraform versions

**yorinasub17** commented *Sep 18, 2020*

Addresses https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1359

This creates a new page that shows users which terraform versions have been officially tested with our terragrunt releases. But includes a caveat to highlight that members of the community have tried and confirmed the version scope is not rigid.

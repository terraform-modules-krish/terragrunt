# Output all

**fajpunk** commented *Feb 25, 2017*

Addresses the `output-all` command and the spin-* command renaming from https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/118 (though not the `apply-all-interactive` yet).

* Renames `spin-up` and `tear-down` to `apply-all` and `destroy-all`
* Adds a deprecation warning printed to stdout when spin-up and tear-down are called
* Adds an `output-all` command to run `terraform output` in all dirs in a stack
* Renames the `spin` module to `configstack` (the name `stack` was already used in a lot of places throughout the codebase)
* Renames various other functions to match new terminology

I might be seeing a race condition in the s3 remote state bucket creation.  Investigating...

This is ready to be looked at again.  Updated with the integration test as described.  I had to mess with a lot of the app to be able to capture the stdout of the terraform commands in the tests... there's probably a better way to do that that I'm not seeing :)

As it stands, attached is the full output from running `AWS_PROFILE=terragrunt-test go test -v -parallel 128 $(glide novendor) 2>&1 | tee test-results.txt`.

Good call on avoiding `nil`s.  After those changes, ouput of:

```AWS_PROFILE=terragrunt-test go test -v -parallel 128 $(glide novendor) 2>&1 | tee test-results-$(git rev-parse HEAD).txt```

Is attached:

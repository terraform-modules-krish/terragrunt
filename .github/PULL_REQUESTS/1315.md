# Account for iam role configurations when fetching remote state in dependency optimization

**yorinasub17** commented *Aug 26, 2020*

Fixes https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1314

This fixes a bug that was introduced in the recent dependency retrieval optimization, where it was not accounting for IAM role assume configurations.

NOTE: I didn't add tests because it doesn't look like we have tests for this functionality, but we should figure out a way to have a test. In the meantime, I am going to cut an alpha testing release so that the reporter can test this.

Have confirmation that this indeed fixes the issue, so will go ahead to merge. Thanks for the review!

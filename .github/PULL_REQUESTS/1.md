# RDD: Create Readme to describe how terragrunt will work

**brikis98** commented *May 25, 2016*

This PR solely contains a README that describes how Terragrunt v0.0.1 can work. Submitting it now for early feedback before I dive into the implementation details.

The goal was to find the cheapest, simplest option for improving collaboration & locking in Terraform. To accomplish that, Iâ€™m offering two ways of locking that leverage tools you (probably) already have access to and are free or very inexpensive: Git and DynamoDB.

Closing this PR since it has been superseded by #2.

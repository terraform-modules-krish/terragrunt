# Better log message for stack

**yorinasub17** commented *Oct 12, 2021*

This outputs a better log message that shows only the modules that will be run by the command, and in the order it will be processed. In the process, the previous message has been demoted to debug level.

This is a much useful output for large projects as it is hard to parse the verbose output and only identify those that had `excluded: false`. What's worse is that the old one did not include the modules that had `AssumeAlreadyApplied: true` flag set, so it gave a false representation of what would happen (as those that are already applied are filtered out of the graph at run time).

### Example module

```
%~> tree .
.
├── account-baseline
│   ├── main.tf
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
└── services
    ├── myapp
    │   ├── main.tf
    │   └── terragrunt.hcl
    ├── mysql
    │   ├── main.tf
    │   └── terragrunt.hcl
    ├── redis
    │   ├── main.tf
    │   └── terragrunt.hcl
    └── vpc
        ├── main.tf
        └── terragrunt.hcl
```

The following runs are done from the `services` folder, so we expect the `account-baseline` to be skipped.

So if I understand correctly, each `Group` in the new output is a level of the dep tree?

Yes. I'm not too happy about the terminology there, but I also wasn't sure what was the best way to show that some modules are run concurrently. I guess this is the limit of a textual representation.

If you have suggestions for a better way to describe that, that would be great!

It works well. The text at the top says they'll be processed in the following order, and the groups show that some things will be processed together. That works for me!

I won't have time to review the code for this today, just letting you know. But it's on my radar.

Thanks for this PR! Makes sense to me.

Thanks for review! Merging and releasing now.

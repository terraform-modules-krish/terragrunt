Hello,
thanks for the contribution, but looks like `go mod tidy` should be executed too:

```
$ go mod tidy
$ git status
On branch oscs_fix_cjvguagau51vtpiu90bg
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   go.mod
        modified:   go.su
```

# Add tflint as built-in hook

<!-- Prepend '[WIP]' to the title if this PR is still a work-in-progress. Remove it when it is ready for review! -->

## Description

This task is part of https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-cis-service-catalog/issues/486, a repo only accessible to Gruntwork customers.

The team is taking the direction of adding `tflint` to Terragrunt as part of the CIS v1.5 upgrade. It will enable us to validate the `inputs` to give a feedback to the user before any resource is deployed. The focus now is to validate the security group rules.


⚠️ [The implementation of `tflint` is attached to the CLI](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint/blob/eefb06ad833b72eaca8c68b57a0557cac431d187/cmd/inspect.go#LL16), so I couldn't find an quick way to use their interface as a library. 

⚠️ **The binary size increased from 33MB to 39MB.**

@marinalimeira great! Some questions from me:

1. Does it leave any `tflint` processes hanging around after `terragrunt` finishes executing?
2. Do we need to hit up our lawyers to check the license compatibility and how we would disclose that in this repo?

Looks like we need to upgrade Go version to 1.18:

I saw that you already have a draft PR @denis256 ! This PR is not critical at the moment, we are still validating other things, so I can wait for that one, thanks.

Analysis of the error message `Failed to initialize plugins; Unrecognized remote plugin message: Incorrect Usage. flag provided but not defined: -act-as-bundled-plugin`:

When the `terraform` plugin is definied [without `version` or without `source`](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint/blob/78315a6fbf3626140affb3fb237164dae40204d6/plugin/install.go#L37), it executes `self` with `--act-as-bundled-plugin` ([source](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint/blob/eefb06ad833b72eaca8c68b57a0557cac431d187/plugin/discovery.go#LL38C56-L38C56)):
```go
cmd = exec.Command(self, "--act-as-bundled-plugin")
```

When `tflint` runs inside Terragrunt, it ends up running `terragrunt --act-as-bundled-plugin`. `Failed to initialize plugins; Unrecognized remote plugin message:` is an error message from `tflint` and ` Incorrect Usage. flag provided but not defined: -act-as-bundled-plugin` is an error message from Terragrunt.

In order to fix this, the `.tflint.hcl` file needs `source` and/or `version:
```
plugin "terraform" {
  enabled = true
  preset  = "recommended"

  version = "0.1.0"
  source  = "github.com/terraform-linters/tflint-ruleset-terraform"
}
```

Without this `.tflint.hcl` file and `terraform` plugin, the `tflint` command inside Terragrunt won't work, given it can't call inside terragrunt the function `exec.Command(self, "--act-as-bundled-plugin")`.

Merge conflicts need to be fixed

**marinalimeira** commented *Dec 5, 2022*

Current status: 
- merge conflicts fixed
- started integration tests, failing so I am investigating why (manual test with terragrunt plan works)

@denis256 this is ready for a first review! Thanks

**marinalimeira** commented *Dec 7, 2022*

I am working now to understand why `TestTflintFindsIssuesWithInvalidInput` is failing, but this might be carried over for tomorrow. It works locally and I can't understand why it fails in the CI.

In the meanwhile, @brikis98 @denis256 this feature is not WIP anymore. Can you please take a look?

@marinalimeira additionally a 'How to Test' section would be super valuable. If I try something manually, e.g:

```bash
cd test/fixture-tflint/issues-found
terragrunt apply -auto-approve
```

It executes the hook but applies successfully. I'm expecting anything in a directory called `issues-found` to fail. Should it be returning an error?

Fixed this! 6394523 I am returning an error now.

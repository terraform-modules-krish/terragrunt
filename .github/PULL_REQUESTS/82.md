# Fix spin-up missing deeper subfolders. Fix AWS API getting overloaded during tests. 

**josh-padnick** commented *Dec 20, 2016*

This PR fixes two separate issues:

- First, it allows `spin-up` and `tear-down` to look for a `.terragrunt` file in more folders than just the immediate subfolders. I implemented unit tests to validate this functionality.
- Second, Terragrunt tests were failing arbitrarily when the AWS API complained of being too much at once. This was because when many parallel Terragrunt tests created a DynamoDB Table and then waited 10 seconds to check again, all checks came at exactly the same time. I resolved this by introducing a random sleep between tests while keeping the API the same for non-test code (i.e. no random sleep for non-test code).

Fixes #81.

Ok, all comments responded to. If this passes tests, unless you strongly object to some of the edge cases I left out of `util.GetRandomTime()`, I think we're good to go here.

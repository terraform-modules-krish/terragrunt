# Run terraform init with flags to avoid downloading plugins

**yorinasub17** commented *Aug 28, 2020*

Addresses https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1313#issuecomment-682226842

It turns out that `terraform init` will still download all the providers even though there is no source code because the info is stored in the state file. However, it is not necessary to initialize with the plugins in order to run `terraform output`: the only thing necessary is the backend configuration.

As such, this PR introduces a further optimization that avoids the provider downloads using CLI flags passed to the `init` call. Note that this causes the command to fail:

```
Initializing the backend...

Successfully configured the backend "s3"! Terraform will automatically
use this backend unless the backend configuration changes.

Initializing provider plugins...

Missing required providers.

The following provider constraints are not met by the currently-installed
provider plugins:

* aws (any version)
* null (any version)
* template (any version)

Terraform can automatically download and install plugins to meet the given
constraints, but this step was skipped due to the use of -get-plugins=false
and/or -plugin-dir on the command line.

If automatic installation is not possible or desirable in your environment,
you may manually install plugins by downloading a suitable distribution package
and placing the plugin's executable file in one of the directories given in
by -plugin-dir on the command line, or in the following directory if custom
plugin directories are not set:
    terraform.d/plugins/darwin_amd64


Error: missing provider "null"



Error: missing provider "aws"



Error: missing provider "template"
```

At this time, there is no way to just setup the backend using `init`, so in this PR, I opted for ignoring the `init` error. To avoid confusing the logs with this expected errors, the stderr output is also now suppressed for the init call. Note that if there was any issue with the backend configuration, the output call will fail and you will see the error there. I also added the option to get the stderr logs to show up by setting `TG_LOG=debug`.

Thanks for review. That is good to know, but it looks like they will try to restore it somehow: https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/25813#issuecomment-675728123

I think this won't affect functionality because we swallow `init` errors, but it will affect runtimes, in which case you can always opt out. I also think https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1322 is the proper fix here (if one wants optimum speed).

Will merge and release this now!

Great job. well done ðŸ¥‡
Running plan-all for more than 100 modules has increased the process a lot!!

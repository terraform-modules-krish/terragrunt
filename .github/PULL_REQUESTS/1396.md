# Commercial support subpage, contact form, footer edits, navbar edits,‚Ä¶

**klijakub** commented *Oct 21, 2020*

Hello,
we've added:

a new subpage - /commercial support
new subpage - /contact
misc edits like navbar & footer link, 'new' badge etc
The contact form is linked to the new formbucket. We've created separate buckets for terragrunt and terratest.
<br />

About the design question, we increased spacing between nav items, our designer has noticed that divider would make it even busier :)

@brikis98 one more thing about the formbucket and the contact form, we didn't add recaptcha v3 like we did it at gruntwork, but I don't know is it a 'must-have' right now, or maybe you want to check if there will be a lot of spam and then we would add it.

We can punt on captcha for now and add it later if it becomes a problem!

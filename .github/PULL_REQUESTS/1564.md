# Added vault support for sops encryption mechanism

**teamfighter** commented *Feb 26, 2021*

This pull request related to https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1562

As used ```go.mozilla.org/sops/v3 v3.5.0``` does not support hashicorp vault, I bumped this go module to ```v3.6.1```
Also added ```github.com/hashicorp/vault v1.6.2``` to avoid ambiguous import error while building binary.
I ran ```go test -v ./...```, here is the output in [gist](https://gist.github.com/teamfighter/edd3421e4279ce70c625b68d4587f4cc).

I hope provided information is enough to merge this PR.

Thanks for the PR! Apologies for the delay. We are super buried right now. We'll get to this as soon as we can.

@brikis98 I have updated go.sum, could you please check it.

Hi @teamfighter,

I have this issue here https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1629.
To fix it I need SOPS 1.7.0 and I see here you are already upgrading SOPS to 1.6.1.

Could you bump it 1.7.0 on this PR? That way you would be fixing my problem too.

Thanks.

This will require additional testing. I'll try to do this today.

As I can see, unit tests are failed. Should I fix something? If so, what exactly?

I think this is the error:

```

I executed ```go get -t github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/cli```, and pushed changed go.sum file.
Could you please kick-off tests again?

Re-running...

Another test failure:

```

FAIL	github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/test [setup failed]
```

Perhaps try running `go mod tidy`?
***

**teamfighter** commented *Apr 10, 2021*

Ran go mod tidy.
Command `gpg --import --no-tty --batch --yes ./test/fixture-sops/test_pgp_key.asc
mkdir -p logs
run-go-tests --packages "$(go list ./... | grep /test | tr '\n' ' ')" | tee logs/integration.log` executes successfully on local build.

# Extend remote_state backend check to include *.tf.json files

**tamsky** commented *Jan 10, 2018*

Original test in #302 only examined files matching `**/*.tf`.

This PR adds support for `*.tf.json` files.

Neither test parses the HCL or json, and instead looks for a hardcoded regex.
Given that the test is a best-effort at helping folks, I don't think we should start parsing anything.

`make fmt` clean.

Test output clean:

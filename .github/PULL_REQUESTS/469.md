# Merge before_hook and after_hook block from child to parent .tfvars

**dtryon** commented *Apr 27, 2018*

This PR attempts to fix #467 

`BeforeHooks` and `AfterHooks` are merged from child to parent .tfvars.  If the name of the child is the same as the name of the parent, the child overrides.  Otherwise, they are appended.

This is very similar to the `TerraformExtraArgs` logic.

Thank you!

@brikis98 Ok, I hope I've completed all the tests.  I decided that one integration test that exercised *most* of the functionality was better then many.  I don't think it is too big :)

I also added unit tests for `nil` config, overlapping hooks and empty child overriding parent.
Thanks again for any feedback

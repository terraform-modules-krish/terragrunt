# Handle CTRL+C. If no args, show help. Fix concurrency test.

**brikis98** commented *Jun 19, 2016*

This PR contains a few fixes:
1. Terragrunt now detects `CTRL+C` and instead of exiting immediately, leaving a lock unreleased, it allows Terraform to shut down gracefully (which it does automatically, since it detects `CTRL+C` itself) and then releases the lock.
2. A minor tweak where we show the help text if no args are provided. We were doing this before, but the code was looking for a `.terragrunt` file first, so if you ran `terragrunt` in a folder without a `.terragrunt` file, youâ€™d get an error message rather than help text.
3. For the concurrency test, increase the number of capacity units on the DynamoDB table. Otherwise, as the test tries to do a lot of reads and writes concurrently, it may intermittently fail with an `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException` error.

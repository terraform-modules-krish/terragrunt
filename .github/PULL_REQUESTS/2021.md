# Don't copy a file if it's the same source and destination.

Should be safe, as the only effect of reading / writing back to the same file is to update the modified timestamp on the file.

Fixes https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/2020, because this file will no longer be modified unless necessary, meaning that multiple processes can read it safely.

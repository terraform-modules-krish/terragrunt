# Make sure terragrunt calls "get" in proper folder during spin-up and tear-down

**brikis98** commented *Dec 14, 2016*

This is a fix for #71. The `shouldDownloadModules` method in Terragrunt was using the (implicit) current working directory rather than the `WorkingDir` set in `TerragruntOptions`. When running the `spin-up` and `tear-down` commands, you must use `WorkingDir`, or you’ll be looking in the wrong folder.

I added a failing test case, implemented the fix, and now the test case passes.

@josh-padnick Going to merge this one in, as it's a fairly simple fix. Feedback welcome. I'll cut a new release too.

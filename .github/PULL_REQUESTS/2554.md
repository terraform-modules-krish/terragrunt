## Description

AWS Go SDK always displays log "Enabling CSM" to stdout when AWS Client Side Monitoring (CSM) is enabled, this prevents the json string from being parsed correctly.

A similar issue is also mentioned in `terraform-provider-aws`: https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/23620
Fixes #2233.

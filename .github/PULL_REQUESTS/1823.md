# #299 Added confirmation before destroy with list of dependent modules

**denis256** commented *Sep 24, 2021*

Updated terragrunt flow to show a list of dependent modules and confirmation of action before destroy
Example (https://github.com/denis256/terragrunt-test-1815) :

app1, app2 -> service-discovery-core -> vpc
```

$ cd shared/service-discovery-core
$ terragrunt destroy
Detected dependent modules:

WARNING: Are you sure you want to continue? (y/n) y
...
Destroy complete!

$ cd shared/vpc
$ terragrunt destroy
Detected dependent modules:
/raid1/tests/terragrunt-test-1815/shared/service-discovery-core
WARNING: Are you sure you want to continue? (y/n)

$ cd applications/gateway/app2
$ terragrunt destroy
...
Do you really want to destroy all resources?
  Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

  Enter a value: 

```

Particularities of implementation:
* `--terragrunt-non-interactive` automatically approve the action, to be consistent with other commands
* detection of root directory from where to find dependencies is based on `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, if it fails `include` directive is used

Ah build failed, because the `ProcessedIncludes` need to be tracked like `IsPartial` in the test. Should be able to fix by updating [this line](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/config/config_as_cty_test.go#L202):

```
case "IsPartial", "ProcessedIncludes":
```

Hi @denis256 and @yorinasub17, thank you for this feature!

There are a couple of issues with this new addition:
1. The destroy plan output no longer shows when running `terragrunt destroy` and there are existing dependent modules, it will only show output for `Detected dependent modules: ...`
2. The dependent modules detection does not run when running `terragrunt run-all plan -destroy`

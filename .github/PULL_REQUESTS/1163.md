# Remove manual definition of KMSMasterKeyID when creating new bucket

**jfharden** commented *May 5, 2020*

Simplest resolution to https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1143

I tried hard to think how to test this, it's extremely difficult to test because it needs an AWS account which has never had the aws/s3 key created. An integration test would look something like:

1. create an AWS account
2. create an IAM admin user on that account
3. run any terragrunt apply to create the s3 bucket
4. try and copy a file to the s3 bucket without manually specifying any encryption (so it tries to use the bucket default)

# Fix out of bounds slice issue on TerraformCliArgs

**sarkis** commented *Feb 24, 2018*

Fixes #411

I decided to not use math.Min as the math package deals in `float64` so settled on a Min function in the util package to find the minimum of two `int`s rather than type casting up and down.

@brikis98 had to move this over to a new PR - hit a weird issue on the other PR I had opened where github was showing "unknown repository" at the top and wasn't allowing me to do anything. I closed the old PR, but don't think I have the right to delete it.

Made sure all tests ran and passed locally, ready for a CR on this when you are free.

Once tests pass, I'll cut a new release and post the link here...

Haha, tests passed, but the `fmt` check failed. I just ran `make fmt` and committed to kick off the build again :)

doh! I had to turn off my autoCommand for go fmt, it was trying to reformat code I hadn't touched - forget if it was on this project - but turning that back on :+1:

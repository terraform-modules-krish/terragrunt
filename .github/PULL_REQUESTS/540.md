# Adds options attribute to track state of the terraform command

**lorengordon** commented *Aug 12, 2018*

The "init" hook command was previously overloaded, and would execute
hooks twice. Once when retrieving source using -from-module, and once
to configure the backend, modules, and plugins.

The new options attribute, `TerraformCommand`, is first set to the
terraform command when the `TerragruntOptions` are parsed from the
CLI arguments.

The `TerraformCommand` attribute is updated when `runTerraformInit`
determines that it needs to retrieve the source using `-from-module`.

Finally, the `TerraformCommand` is now used to determine whether a
hook should execute.

There are now two "init" commands that execute hooks:

* `init-from-module`: executes when the source is retrieved
* `init`: executes for any other init invocation, to configure
the backend, modules, and plugins

Fixes #539

@brikis98 I can work on tests tomorrow. There does seem to be some nuance I am missing. I added a couple simple configs to test, but cannot seem to get it to run init twice the way it does in my own configs.

The `init-once` test does indeed echo the command only once, but there is no source line, so `-from-module` is not used (and this would have worked properly before anyway). If I add a source line,  `source = "."`, as I did in the `init-from-module-once` test, then `-from-module` is used, but it actually retrieves the plugin as well as the code all in one execution, and the second `init` is not called.

Can you maybe point me at the detail I'm missing?

IIRC, Terragrunt calls in the "second time" only if (a) it needs to download modules or (b) it needs to configure a remote state backend. Perhaps if your code has neither, it's skipping the second `init`?
***

**lorengordon** commented *Aug 13, 2018*

I'm having some trouble tracing the logic through the code. Gonna write the test cases for different condition and see if that helps me figure it out. Here are the test cases I think are relevant...

* no-source-no-backend
* no-source-with-backend
* with-source-no-backend
* with-source-with-backend
***

**brikis98** commented *Aug 13, 2018*

The code you're probably looking for is this: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/cli/cli_app.go#L448. Those test cases sound good üëç 
***

**lorengordon** commented *Aug 13, 2018*

Hmm, those test cases are still not quite demonstrating the nuance I'm seeing. Think I might need to split out local vs remote sources...

* no-source-no-backend
* no-source-with-backend
* local-source-no-backend
* local-source-with-backend
* remote-source-no-backend
* remote-source-with-backend

**lorengordon** commented *Aug 13, 2018*

Aha, no, I just had mapped one of the constants to the wrong path. üò≠ 
***

**lorengordon** commented *Aug 13, 2018*

Ok, so the only failing test case with this approach is `with-source-no-backend`. I think I understand why now. I didn't quite have the terragrunt workflow correct.

I think the best approach to better align with how terragrunt works will actually be to rework this so that instead of an `init-from-module` command, we implement an `init-backend` command...

This way, the `command` remains as `init` throughout, and where the backend is configured it would be set to `init-backend`.

Not sure I follow. The `init-from-module` and `init` workflow made sense to me. What is the distinction with `init` and `init-backend`? 
***

**lorengordon** commented *Aug 13, 2018*

The problem I observed was that hooks on the `init` command would execute twice. I always use a source and a backend, which seems to be the only config that causes this to happen. 

For the first hook execution, I would see the command:

```
terraform init // -backend-config ... // -from-module ...
```

And for the second hook execution, I would see the same command, just without the `-from-module ...`:

```
terraform init // -backend-config ... //
```

This code path is triggered within `runTerragrunt()` when the test for `getTerraformSourceUrl()` calls `downloadTerraformSource()`. `downloadTerraformSource()` eventually calls `runTerraformInit()`, which calls `runTerragruntWithConfig()` with the necessary init options. `terraform init -from-module` then executes.

From here, things operate basically the same as they do without a `source` argument... `runTerragrunt()` executes `runTerragruntWithConfig()` again, but now with the original non-init command. And it's `prepareNonInitCommand()` that triggers the second init.

Ok, I mostly needed to write that out for myself to better understand the workflow. üòÅ To the point at hand, the trouble with `init-from-module` basically comes down to expectations...

* `no-source-no-backend`:
  * `init-from-module` *does not* trigger hook, `init` command *does*. This behavior is EXPECTED
* `no-source-with-backend`:
  * `init-from-module` *does not* trigger hook, `init` command *does*. This behavior is EXPECTED
* `with-source-no-backend`:
  * `init-from-module` *does* trigger hook, `init` command *does not*. This behavior is **NOT EXPECTED**
* `with-source-with-backend`:
  * `init-from-module` *does* trigger hook, `init` command also triggers hook. This behavior is EXPECTED

I feel like you _should_ be able to trigger on `init` reliably, but this approach doesn't work without a backend (or another condition that causes `needsInit()` to return true).

Unfortunately, now having a better understanding of the workflow that is triggering the second init, I'm not sure I see a simple way to set the command accordingly... and yeah, we can take `init-backend` off the table as it would not be accurate, since there's really several conditions that trigger `needsInit()`.

I mean, I could just change the test to match what actually happens. . .
***

**brikis98** commented *Aug 13, 2018*

An alternative is to have just a single `init` command that hooks fire on and to track if we've already run a hook for the `init` command using a new field in `TerragruntOptions`. 
***

**lorengordon** commented *Aug 13, 2018*

I'll give that a go tomorrow. I would like to preserve the use case where a before or after hook can copy/render .tf files in the working directly, though. That requires executing after the source is pulled in, but before the backend initializes...
***

**lorengordon** commented *Aug 14, 2018*

Reverted the prior changes and updated the tests to demonstrate clearly the use case failure. Go TDD, right?

Working on the other approach now. It's a little more difficult, since the hooks have state (before and after), but that state is not actually part of the hook attributes. So we need to track the hook state through the code. Hmm...
***

**brikis98** commented *Aug 14, 2018*

+1 for TDD.

FWIW, I tried to clean up the `init` logic before, but Terraform is a bit finicky with `init`, `-from-module`, and all the other params. E.g., See https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/523. Ideally, we'd only ever call `init` once... but I haven't been able to get that to work yet.
***

**lorengordon** commented *Aug 14, 2018*

Setting a flag on the `TerragruntOptions` doesn't seem to work... I think because the options are cloned in `runTerraformInit()`? Would changes to option attributes when init is executed also get applied on the original options? Fairly new to Go, so not sure how some of these things are supposed to work...
***

**brikis98** commented *Aug 14, 2018*

Ah, yea, you're right, we do clone it, specifically so we don't make accidental modifications to the original. 

I'm thinking the original implementation you had in [this comment](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/540#issuecomment-412589620) may be our best bet as it most accurately reflects Terragrunt's actual behavior. In a separate PR, it may be worth looking into changing how we call `init` and `init -from-module`.
***

**lorengordon** commented *Aug 14, 2018*

Ok, sounds good. Definitely starting to look like more of a rabbit hole than I expected. üòÜ

I'll back out the reverts, get the tests back to passing, and update the readme to try to help explain the behavior.
***

**lorengordon** commented *Aug 14, 2018*

Are there tests that are known to be failing right now? `go test -parallel 128 $(glide novendor)` is exiting non-zero, but I can't figure out which test is actually failing because there is so much stdout/stderr output from the integration tests.
***

**brikis98** commented *Aug 14, 2018*

I just realized there's a workaround for the Terraform bug in https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/18460 that caused me to revert https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/516. I can simply catch the error from that bug and ignore it! I've submitted that as a PR here: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/542.

With that PR, the call to `init -from-module` now has `-get=false`, `-get-plugins=false`, and `-backend=false` set, so all of that download/configuration will happen solely in the second call to `init`. I _think_ that might fix the inconsistent behavior you're seeing!
***

**brikis98** commented *Aug 14, 2018*

I'm not aware of any existing test failures, but I'll let you know what happens when the tests finish for https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/542.

You're still getting the "Error walking file path fixture-download due to error: read xxx: is a directory" error? You're sure your local code has this patch?

https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/test/integration_test.go#L951-L955

The fix was that `info.IsDir()` incorrectly returns `false` for symlinked directories, so now the code checks for symlinks....

**lorengordon** commented *Aug 14, 2018*

I had just installed/setup go before beginning this work, so latest at the time: `go version go1.10.3 linux/amd64`.

As for OS... well, that's where it gets complicated. It's Windows 10, but I use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), which appears pretty seamlessly to most everything as Ubuntu 18.04. I clone the repo on the Windows-side and do all my editing and git work there, but I mount the repo directory on the Linux side, and create a symlink into `$GOPATH`. Then I run the tests from WSL. So, yeah, weird is the name of the game... very well might be a local setup issue of some kind...

Oh, I gotcha. OK, then this error may be some symlink / Windows issue. Probably not worth digging into those two test failures, assuming all the other tests are passing.

# Fix xxx-all commands, attempt #2

**brikis98** commented *Jul 11, 2018*

This is a follow-up to https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/518. That fix did not handle all cases. In particular, I missed:

1. A Terraform module nested inside of a subfolder inside of a `.terragrunt-cache` folder.
1. A user specifying a customer `--terragrunt-download-dir`, which also should be excluded from `xxx-all` commands.

I think this _finally_ fixes #517!

More importantly, this also adjusts the default downloading behavior. Instead of going into the current working directory, it goes into the directory where the Terragrunt configuration file (`terraform.tfvars`) is located. These are the same if you just run `terragrunt apply` or `terragrunt plan`, but will be different if you run `terragrunt plan-all` or `terragrunt apply-all`. The new behavior keeps the downloaded code with the configuration file that says to download it, which hopefully makes debugging and understanding what's going on a lot easier.

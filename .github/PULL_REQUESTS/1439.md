# Fix nested mocks

**yorinasub17** commented *Nov 24, 2020*

### Problem

When retrieving dependencies, terragrunt would clone the `TerragruntOptions` object and replace the `TerraformCommand` to `output` so that we can run `terraform output` in the terragrunt context. This breaks the mock outputs feature because the mock outputs feature depended on knowing the original terraform command to decide when to return mock outputs. When you have deep dependencies (a dependency config that also has a dependency within), the nested dependency sees `output` as the terraform command, as opposed to the original one (e.g., `validate`). This makes configurations confusing because you need to add `output` to the `mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands`.

### Solution

We now track what the original terraform command. This will be the top level command that was run from the CLI. The PR works by only setting the `OriginalTerraformCommand` once at the beginning, and flowing that through everytime we clone the options.

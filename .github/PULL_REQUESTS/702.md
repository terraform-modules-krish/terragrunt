**tonerdo** commented *May 13, 2019*

This PR sets up a Windows CI for Terragrunt using Azure Pipelines (replacing AppVeyor). 

We're able to split into unit and integration test jobs

We can also publish XML test results generated by the Terratest log parser

Unlike AppVeyor (and like CircleCI) we can have organizations

Some tests are failing of course, but the point of this PR is to get the Windows CI infrastructure setup

@brikis98 I invited you to the Gruntwork Azure DevOps org. Let me know if you have any trouble

Just checking if this is something we're still interested in. So I can properly handover ownership of the Azure DevOps Gruntwork organization

Yes, thanks for checking @tonerdo! I've just been on vacation and haven't had time to dig into this stuff yet. And now #466 is a high priority, so I need to wrap that up, and will then come back to this.

Any update on this?  Building out a pipeline and wondering; when this is going to be merged?

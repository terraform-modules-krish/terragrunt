# Reference documentation

**yorinasub17** commented *Jan 20, 2020*

I oftentimes find myself looking for a reference to a particular block or attribute in the terragrunt docs (now website) and never find what I am looking for because it is buried in one of the use case docs or feature description. Many projects provide a comprehensive API reference style documentation that enumerates all the functions and config that is available. I think it would be useful for terragrunt to have the same, so this PR does exactly that:

- Add a 4th section in the nav, `Reference`
- Move the "CLI options" and "Built-in functions" reference docs to `Reference`
- Add a new page in `Reference` that enumerates all the blocks and attributes supported in `terragrunt.hcl`

## Bonus feature

I could not get the website to work on my Mac. I had lots of issues getting `bundle install` to work, especially compiling `libv8` for `the_ruby_racer`. In the end I gave up trying and added a `Dockerfile` with `docker-compose.yml` so we can use docker for local development. That worked beautifully.

Yeah, changes in the PR and a new approach are compatible with each other.

The `navigation.yml` will be removed, so less manual work will be required.

The "Configuration Blocks and Attributes" contains **Blocks**, **terraform** and **remote_state** as headings so all of them will be present in navigation.

This is now ready for review. Note that I did have an issue getting the nav to work properly. When I navigate directly to the configuration reference page (e.g enter the URL directly), the navbar is not expanded:

<img width="1424" alt="Configuration_Blocks_and_Attributes" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/430092/73027505-6b4ae980-3de8-11ea-947a-30f8045f958a.png">

But it works if I navigate from the side bar:

<img width="1425" alt="Configuration_Blocks_and_Attributes" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/430092/73027554-7bfb5f80-3de8-11ea-83cf-ec07a348f35a.png">

I don't seem to have the same issue with the other pages ("CLI options" and "Built in functions") so 
not sure what I did wrong here.

As the author of https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1010, I've been following this and it looks like its going to be a great resource for people coming into using the project and folks that felt their way through (me) and still have a lot to learn.  Kudos!

Updated to address merge conflicts with nav updates. @brikis98 this is ready for review now! Would be good to get this in sooner than later because it makes RDD harder. E.g the page being updated for https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1021 has been moved on this branch.

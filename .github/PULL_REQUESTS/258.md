# WIP: tfvars files should be ignored during *-all commands if they have no source setting and no .tf file is present

**jonahh-yeti** commented *Jul 27, 2017*

Bit of a fresh GO programmer, but this change should do the trick.  The outstanding issue is that since the test data used is mostly just blank .tfvars files, any attempt to resolve these is now ignored so a ton of tests are failing.  Any advice on how to proceed or comments on the code would be welcome :)

Hey!  So, I made changes around your recommendations in the code.  The logic looks much cleaner overall now.  Also changed the tests so they don't all get caught by this addition, had to both edit the files in the test/fixture-modules/ directories and the expected values in the tests.  Finally, added a new test case and data in test/fixture-modules/module-l/ to check that a .tfvars file with no Terragrunt block and associated source, and no .tf file in the directory, will be skipped.  All tests are passing locally.  

Let me know what you think!

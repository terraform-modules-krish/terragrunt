# Make xxx-all commands ignore modules with skip=true

**cbascom** commented *Feb 23, 2019*

Some terraform.tfvars files exist just to DRY up the config. In those
cases, we need a way to tell the xxx-all commands that those files don't
actually represent any infrastructure, they are just included in other
terraform.tfvars files. This change allows you to specify skip = true in
the terragrunt { ... } block to accomplish this. This addresses #623.

> You can probably put the `Skip` check in `cli_app.runTerragrunt`.

cli_app.runTerragrunt only handles single module commands. Are you saying just add support for this skip flag in that case in addition to how I have it supported for the multi module commands?

I don't see a good way right off to move the multi module command support I added over into cli_app because cli_app.runCommand calls cli_app.runMultiModuleCommand instead of cli_app.runTerragrunt for the xxx-all commands. Also, that processing is different anyway since we need to look for the skip flag in every terraform.tfvars file that we find in the xxx-all cases.

Let me know if we're on the same page there and I will get the single module command support added as well.

IIRC, the multi-module commands eventually call `runTerragrunt` for each of the modules. Add some logging and you should be able to verify.

Ahh nice, I didn't add logging yet, but I believe you are correct based on looking through that code path more thoroughly. I will hopefully have some time later today to make that change. Thanks for the heads up!

@brikis98 Can you take a look at the updated version of this when you get a chance?
***

**cbascom** commented *Apr 2, 2019*

Integration tests have been added now as well.

**brikis98** commented *Apr 4, 2019*

Wonderful, thanks! I'm running you branch through our test suite in our test env now.

My bad, that will teach me for not re-running the tests after resolving a merge conflict :). It should be good to go now.

Got another test failure. Not sure how much of the log is relevant:

Hmm, I can't repro that failure locally so there must be something I'm not understanding about the integration test environment. I'm going through the logs from that run to see if I can understand what is different.

I just re-ran the tests and they failed again, so this doesn't seem like an intermittent failure. Here's the latest log output:

This may be something to do with `terraform init` and having your local copy already initialized, whereas the one in CI always starts from scratch and isn't. Perhaps try to do a clean check out of your branch into a new folder and run the tests from scratch?
***

**cbascom** commented *Apr 15, 2019*

I was able to reproduce locally by running all four tests from the command line instead of one at a time through VS Code like I had been doing. It appears the problem is running them in parallel, which makes sense given the fact that multiple tests are creating/deleting files in the same fixture directories.

I've gone ahead and just made the tests not parallel in my latest push. The other option would be a separate fixture directory for each test so they can run in parallel. If you prefer that second option let me know and I will change to do it that way instead.
***

**brikis98** commented *Apr 16, 2019*

Ah, gotcha. Instead of disabling parallelism, look into the `copyEnvironment` approach used by the other tests.
***

**cbascom** commented *Apr 16, 2019*

Ahh, of course, thanks. I saw that when I first wrote the tests but then forgot about it. That definitely seems to do the trick on my end, hopefully it will here now as well!
***

**cbascom** commented *Apr 19, 2019*

Any word on this? It looks like all the checks passed, do you still need to run tests elsewhere as well or does that indicate this is good to go?

I'm not sure about license point, I got this code snippet from [Terraform repo](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/13cb0d03c7d6cca7b22966428c6032ab1ac4c574/internal/command/fmt.go#L569) which is licensed under MPL 2.0.

Hi, will be helpful to have tests to track and validate that this feature is working overtime

@denis256 I thought about tests but currently have no idea how to implement testing diff.
Create diff output fixture, run hclfmt with diff option and compare?

Hi, 
integration tests examples can be found in `test/integration_test.go`, 
I think the test should run `hclfmt --terragrunt-diff` and verify that difference is generated.

@denis256 could you help me here?
I can't get stdout using `bytes.Buffer{}`:

```go
func TestHclFmtDiff(t *testing.T) {
	t.Parallel()

	cleanupTerraformFolder(t, TEST_FIXTURE_HCLFMT_DIFF)
	tmpEnvPath := copyEnvironment(t, TEST_FIXTURE_HCLFMT_DIFF)
	rootPath := util.JoinPath(tmpEnvPath, TEST_FIXTURE_HCLFMT_DIFF)

	stdout := bytes.Buffer{}
	stderr := bytes.Buffer{}
	require.NoError(
		t,
		runTerragruntCommand(t, fmt.Sprintf("terragrunt hclfmt --terragrunt-diff --terragrunt-working-dir %s", rootPath), &stdout, &stderr),
	)
	output := stdout.String()

	expectedDiff, err := ioutil.ReadFile(rootPath + "/expected.diff")
	assert.NoError(t, err)

	logBufferContentsLineByLine(t, stdout, "output")
	assert.Contains(t, output, string(expectedDiff))
}
```

`output` is empty. Could it happen because I'm using `fmt.Printf()` [here](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/2570/files#diff-3e517b1044febd64a328b7f30b8a2d8d33092b32fb3f288c64a5d8f1544ee5d6R102)?

Hi,
I think should be used `terragruntOptions.Writer` https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/options/options.go#L129
```
_, err := fmt.Fprintf(terragruntOptions.Writer, "%s\n", diff)
```

Resolved all the threads, added integration test

**okgolove** commented *May 29, 2023*

@denis256 could you take a look?

Should be better now.

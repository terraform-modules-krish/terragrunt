# Unskip S3 bucket access logging test

**ina-stoyanova** commented *Dec 2, 2020*

**Context:** 

This was previously skipped, until Terratest was updated to contain a `GetBucketLogging` function exposed - https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/pull/689.

**This PR:**
- is unskipping the `TestTerragruntSetsAccessLoggingForTfSTateS3BuckeToADifferentBucket` test & updating `terragrunt` to use the latest `terratest` release

Thanks for the review @marinalimeira ðŸ™‚ Going to look at the tests & why they've failed at some point later today.

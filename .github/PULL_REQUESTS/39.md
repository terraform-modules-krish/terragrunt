# Bump all dependency versions, and AWS SDK in particular.

**josh-padnick** commented *Oct 3, 2016*

One user was reporting random panics when `STS.GetCallerIdentity()` was being called, so hopefully updating to the latest AWS SDK for Golang will resolve the issue. 

BTW, note the new explicit specification of a tag in `glide.yaml`. We should probably do this for all dependencies going forward.

# feat: improve local source code download behaviour

**BlackDark** commented *Feb 1, 2022*

* generate hash based on source dir and save it as the current version

Fixes #1926 

What logic is applied:
* in case of local sources (checked via the `IsLocalSource` func)
* generate a hash of the local directory and use it as version for terragrunt



Currently in discussion state. If the maintainers are happy with the changes I will cleanup the print outputs ( for the developing they are useful to keep an eye on the generated hashes :) )

Stuck since a while now.

Hi,
once test `printfs` will be removed and fixed spacing for `TestAlreadyHaveLatestCodeLocalFilePathWithHashChanged` I think PR will be ready for merge

Remove the prints and not sure what you mean with wrong spacing in the test method?

Not a big deal, but it is inconsistent with the rest of test functions

Found the error. Removed one output to the test version file which is necessary. Now the tests should pass again.

Just eyeballing the changelogs, I am suspecting that this change might be behind #2171 ....

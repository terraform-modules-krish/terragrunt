# Fixing behavior of `--terragrunt-strict-include` when no `--terragrunt-include-dir` flags are included

**celestialorb** commented *Apr 2, 2021*

This PR is an attempt to fix the behavior of Terragrunt when the `--terragrunt-strict-include` flag is supplied without any `--terragrunt-include-dir` flags.

The expected behavior is that Terragrunt will evaluate to not run on any modules in this case, but the current behavior is that it will run over all modules of the working directory.

This is to address #1600.

Added in basic tests for this behavior and was able to get them to pass locally on my machine after a minor change as Go wasn't picking up the `TERRAGRUNT_DEBUG_FILE` constant value located in `integration_debug_test.go`. I didn't include that change though, just the additions to the tests and the actual fix as well.

@brikis98 Yep, I'll find some time to do that later tonight or tomorrow, thanks!

@brikis98 Added a statement to the docs about the new behavior of the `--terragrunt-strict-include` flag. If it all looks good, this should be ready to merge in. :)

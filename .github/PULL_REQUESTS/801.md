# hclfmt

**yorinasub17** commented *Jul 27, 2019*

According to https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/22092, it seems unlikely that `terraform fmt` would support formatting `terragrunt.hcl` directly. In that PR, it was suggested that [we should standardize to using `hclfmt`](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/22092#issuecomment-512028847). However, this is an additional utility that one needs to install, not to mention that it is not officially released yet.

As such, this PR bakes the functionality of `hclfmt` as a sub command of `terragrunt`, so that you can run `terragrunt hclfmt` to format your `terragrunt.hcl` files in the directory tree.

UPDATE:

- Simplified `shouldRunHCLFmt` and `shouldPrintTerragruntInfo`
- Replaced `findTerragruntHclFiles` with `zglob.Glob`
- Replaced `readAllFromFile` with `util.ReadFileAsString`
- Updated working directory to pull from `options.WorkingDir`

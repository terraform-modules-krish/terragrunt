# WIP: fix slice out of bounds on tf cli args

**sarkis** commented *Feb 15, 2018*

@brikis98 got started on this.. still a WIP: 

Fixes #411

* I decided to not use math.Min as the `math` package deals in `float64` so settled on a Min function in the util package. I'll add a test for this.

* This will still fail when you run `terragrunt force-unlock`, however, it won't be a go panic but instead terraform complaining that no ID was passed. This was the best behavior I can think of being that terragrunt is a wrapper - lmk if you think it should behave differently.

I'll need to add tests and check out different edge cases I haven't thought of yet - but hoping to get a CR early to see if I am at least on the right track with this.

@brikis98 Q on tests - I looked over the `arg_test.go` - looks like those tests are just to ensure the args get parsed correctly right? 

Didn't want to re-do work, but couldn't find any tests that actually run and check terragrunt all the way through, which I don't think is right.. but wanted to confirm before starting to write these.

I'll re-open this pull request - looks like something weird happening with my fork

Can delete this for cleanup ... it was reopened and merged here: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/420 - something wrong with this PR (can see above says it's coming from an unknown repository)

@brikis98 Ok addressed comments and sanity checks, and rebased + resolved merge conflicts. I think this is ready for a final review!

UPDATE: Fixed broken build in bc4eba9 . Not sure why this works on `master`, but in any case, this fixes a bug from https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1510 where the `LogLevel` is set to `PanicLevel` when the `TerragruntOptions` struct is `Clone`d.

# Support inheritance and interpolation in .terragrunt files

**brikis98** commented *Nov 25, 2016*

This PR adds support for two new features to Terragrunt:

1. Inheritance. A `.terragrunt` file can specify a `parent` configuration from which to inherit all settings.
1. Interpolation. Terragrunt now supports two basic interpolation functions: `find_in_parent_folders`, which can be used to automatically find a `.terragrunt` file in a parent folder rather than manually specifying the path, and `path_relative_to_parent`, which returns the relative path between a child `.terragrunt` file and a parent, which is useful for automatically populating `state_file_id` and `key` based on folder structure.

Check out the README for full details. Here is a [direct link to the branch](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/tree/inherit#managing-multiple-terragrunt-files), as that's easier to read than a diff.

This fixes #26.

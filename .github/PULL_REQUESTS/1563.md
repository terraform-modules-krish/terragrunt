# Fix dead link in multiple aws accounts docs

**paulvandenburg** commented *Feb 25, 2021*

The link to AWS docs is now 404.
The corrected link seems to most closely resemble the intended target.
Other options to consider:
https://aws.amazon.com/organizations/getting-started/best-practices/
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/aws-multi-account-landing-zone.html

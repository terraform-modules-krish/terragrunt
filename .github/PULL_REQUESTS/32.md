# config: tweak remote_state bindings to be consistent with Terraform

**pmcatominey** commented *Sep 27, 2016*

- snake_case used in favour of camelCase
- backendConfigs renamed to config to read better
- config tags changed from json to hcl for clarity
- updated README examples
- go fmt shuffled some imports in the remote state files

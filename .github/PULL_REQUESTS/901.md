Just a head up I used the same method of determining the default download directory https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/901/files#diff-56be1e853ecf6e7ad64321692db32678R280 as in #866 which itself is somehow related to #904, so maybe it makes sense to understand what's going on there first.

The bad thing is I can't reproduce that issue.

I've been able to reproduce the issue, and is fixed in master. See https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/937. The crux of the issue was https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/906#issuecomment-545072547.

So probably good to pick this up again!

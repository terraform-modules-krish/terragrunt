## Description

Included changes:

 * Improve logging of Terragrunt errors to show HCL files in which locals parsing fails
 * Logging of the directory in which Terraform invocation failed

Example outputs:
```
# Failed evaluation of locals:
ERRO[0000] Encountered error while evaluating locals in file /projects/gruntwork/terragrunt-tests/broken-locals/broken.hcl 
ERRO[0000] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1 

# Failed dependencies:
ERRO[0002] Terraform invocation failed in /projects/gruntwork/terragrunt-tests/broken-dependencies/dependency2 
ERRO[0002] Terraform invocation failed in /projects/gruntwork/terragrunt-tests/broken-dependencies/dependency
ERRO[0002] 1 error occurred:
        * exit status 1
```

# Add basic support for remote state management

**brikis98** commented *Jun 1, 2016*

**Note**: This PR was originally #3, which has already been reviewed, but was a PR against #2. I’ve now reopened it against master and will immediately merge it.

This PR allows Terragrunt to automatically manage remote state for you. The goal is to prevent manual errors, such as forgetting to enable remote state or entering the wrong bucket.

The basic idea is that you can define your remote state details in the `.terragrunt` file and Terragrunt will automatically enable that state any time you run it. 

This is the most basic implementation of this best practice and in future implementations, we could consider even more robust options, such as:
1. Add a `manage-remote-state` command that enables remote state storage with best practices (e.g. creating an S3 bucket, enabling versioning, enabling encryption).
2. Only enable remote state if it isn’t _already_ enabled so commands run faster.

Whoops, I opened this PR against the wrong branch again. Ignore :)

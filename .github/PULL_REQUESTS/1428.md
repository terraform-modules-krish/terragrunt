# Fix Terraform version check with CLI env vars

**awiddersheim** commented *Nov 13, 2020*

Fix passing command line arguments to Terraform using the `TF_CLI_ARGS`
environment variables[1]. Need to exclude those variables from the
version check.

Great, thank you! One more thing, could you pull in the latest from `master`? I can kick off tests after that.

@brikis98 Looks like I didn't `fmt` my last commits. I updated. Can you kick them off again?

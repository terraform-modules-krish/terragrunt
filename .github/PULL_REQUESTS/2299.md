## Description

Update `render-json` to include new field `dependent_modules` which includes list of paths to dependent modules.

Example output:

```

    └── terragrunt_rendered.json

# terragrunt render-json

{
...
  "dependent_modules": [
    "/tmp/terragrunt-test4030865563/fixture-destroy-warning/app"
  ],
...
}

# terragrunt render-json --render-json
{
...
  "dependent_modules": {
    "metadata": {
      "found_in_file": "/tmp/terragrunt-test4030865563/fixture-destroy-warning/vpc/terragrunt.hcl"

I'm getting errors when I run `terragrunt render-json` in the `test/fixture-destroy-warning` folder. The errors only happen when run with the build from this branch; when I run terragrunt `v0.39.0`, it works fine.

```

Interesting case, will look why it happens and how to handle

The issue happens because to detect dependent modules is built a stack from repository root, which in the current case fails to parse HCL from test expected test `fixture-broken-locals/terragrunt.hcl` - this may also happen in regular repositories, some HCL files may be broken and fail detection of dependent modules

So far I was thinking to try to navigate from working dir to git root and for each step to build stack and extract dependent modules:
```
Git dir: /projects/gruntwork/terragrunt
Working dir: /projects/gruntwork/terragrunt/test/fixture-destroy-warning/vpc
Evaluated paths:
/projects/gruntwork/terragrunt/test/fixture-destroy-warning
/projects/gruntwork/terragrunt/test
/projects/gruntwork/terragrunt

```

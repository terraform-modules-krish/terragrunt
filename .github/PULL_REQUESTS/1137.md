# WIP command flag `--terragrunt-debug`

**eboto** commented *Apr 14, 2020*

**Work-in-progress do not merge**

Adds a new flag `--terragrunt-debug`. Right now the flag only helps with dependency and local var resolution, but could be expanded to support things like detailed logs, version output, etc.

See the included README.md for more info.

Tasks:
  - [x] Readme
  - [ ] Test-cases
  - [ ] Implementation

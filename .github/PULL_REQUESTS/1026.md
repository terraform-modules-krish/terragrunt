Hi @ajorpheus,

Thank you for this repo https://github.com/ajorpheus/terragunt-auto-init-issue! I just tried to reproduce the issue with your example, but I didn't succeed. I run in many different ways in the hope that it will show me the mentioned error, but no, every time terragrunt runs `terraform init`. I assume that the issue is somehow resolved. Could you please confirm or deny this?

I close the PR as it is no longer relevant.

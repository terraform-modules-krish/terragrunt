# Make sure Terragrunt redownloads code if no .tf files in tmp folder

This is a fix for #266. The typical cause is that OS X deletes the *contents* of a tmp folder, but not the tmp folder itself, so Terragrunt thought the download source was still there, even though the folder was empty.

Merging now. Feedback welcome. Hopefully this will fix that annoying issue for everyone!

# GH-493: do not add -var or -var-file extra_arguments during "apply" if plan is provided

**marcoreni** commented *Sep 27, 2018*

Fixes #493 

This PR adds a "special case" as discussed in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/493#issuecomment-417814191 

The script now checks if the command in question is `apply` and if the second argument is a file. If so, `-var` and `-var-file` appends are skipped. 

I also added some tests on the function to be sure.

Hey @brikis98 ,

1. Yes I did: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/577/commits/fcc3a263cd9bede2860a469d81625843e292d4a6
2. I tried running the tests on Windows but I received some strange failures, for example:
```
--- FAIL: TestGetParentTfVarsDir (0.01s)
Error Trace:    config_helpers_test.go:825
Error:          Not equal:
				expected: "D:/other-child"
				actual: "C:/other-child"
Messages:       For include &{../../other-child/terraform.tfvars} and options &{C:/child/sub-child/terraform.tfvars terraform  <nil> true true [] C:\child\sub-child 0xc00028a820 map[]  false C:\child\sub-child\.terragrunt-cache  false 0xc00008a008 0xc00008a010 100 [] 0x53b590}
```
I assume that this is because my gocode dir is on D:\ drive. 

Do I have to do anything in particular to run the tests?

Ah, yea, looks like we make an unfortunate assumption here: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/968cf5b2dca606339eabeeaf407732ed34eac9f4/test/helpers/test_helpers_windows.go#L5. Later on, that test code ends up calling [filepath.Abs](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/0bdb5f9ebbcad4ebe2c104bb1c51c186d3ad10f7/util/file.go#L106) which will use the current working dir. 

I know it's unrelated to this PR, but you could you see if changing the hard-coded `C:/` to the root of your working dir fixes it?

Hello @brikis98. I tried changing `C:/` to `D:/` but I think there still are some issues, for example:
```
FAIL: TestLocalWithBackend (2.24s)
    integration_test.go:1144: Copying fixture-download to C:\Users\reni\AppData\Local\Temp\terragrunt-test775695595

    assertions.go:239: 
```

I tried running the tests on WSL and they all passed. 
```shell

```


I'll make further checks on the Windows errors and try to open a separate PR for that.

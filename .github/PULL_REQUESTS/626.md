# Implements #607 - Run apply-all only on specified targets

**mattiarossi** commented *Dec 20, 2018*

This implements #607 by adding a -terragrunt-include-dir CLI flag.

It supports unix-style globs and will include all modules within or under the specified directories during execution. It will ignore any other module (except for dependencies)

I have reused code from the --terragrunt-exclude-dir patch, shouldExcludeModuleBecauseOfPath  would need renaming in order to reflect the dual usage
Also, I reused the TEST_FIXTURE_LOCAL_WITH_EXCLUDE_DIR in the integration test, let me know if you need them duplicated in  a dedicated folder instead

Regards,
Mattia

Hm, tests failed on release. Relevant snippets:

```
--- FAIL: TestIncludeDirs (6.59s)

Weird, it runs locally, but haven't run all tests, doing it now

I have tried to run go test -v -parallel 128 in ./test but depending on the OS I run it it fails at different points, and cannot understand the state of TestIncludeDirs:

`

.. and scratch that, testincludedirs passes:
`
--- PASS: TestTerragruntBeforeAndAfterMergeHook (8.88s)
    integration_test.go:255: bucketName: terragrunt-test-bucket-5r2iik
    integration_test.go:1556: Deleting test s3 bucket terragrunt-test-bucket-5r2iik

--- PASS: TestTerragruntWorksWithIncludes (9.08s)
    integration_test.go:1556: Deleting test s3 bucket terragrunt-test-bucket-fhfwej

--- PASS: TestIncludeDirs (9.34s)
`

The fail happens later, just after destroying the temp s3 bucket

Just re-ran the tests and this time they passed... Perhaps there was some intermittent issue? We'll keep our eyes on the tests...

Am I using this wrong?  I want to build any folder underneath me that matches this pattern *mcs*.

te plan-all --terragrunt-include-dir=*mcs*

te plan-all --terragrunt-include-dir="*mcs*"

thanks

# Fix get_path_from_repo_root typo

**stevenpitts** commented *Mar 10, 2022*

The documentation for `get_path_from_repo_root` is backwards.

For example, if my repo root is `/code/my-repo` and the current directory is `/code/my-repo/environments/staging`, `get_path_from_repo_root` returns `environments/staging`, not `../..`.

@yorinasub17 @rhoboat @zackproser Is there anything I can do to proceed with getting this merged? It should be a pretty clear cut fix

# adding env var for --terragrunt-include-external-dependencies

**elebertus** commented *Feb 12, 2021*

Hey there!

We've been running into the same issue as #1418 and [gruntwork-io/terratest/issues/699](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/issues/699). This small patch provides the ability to use an environment var with the expected behavior.

I looked through the tests around this code and didn't see where the env var bits for cli flags were tested. I'm happy to add coverage for this or discuss any required changes.

Let me know what thoughts are around the change.

Edit: forgot to include test run output, gist link [here](https://gist.github.com/elebertus/449c9b72e9a9310e920518996140c051) - not sure if the full integration tests need to pass as well, in which case I'll need to read through what is required in AWS and plan accordingly.

@brikis98 sorry about the hassle on the strange commit for `configstack/stack.go` and my poorly configured vscode plugins for markdown.

I think all your comments are addressed now.

# Update cli-options.md to mention silent auto-approve on run-all.

**gchappel** commented *Jan 20, 2022*

Added a note explaining that due to the shared `stdin` and `stdout` meaning you can't approve any given individual apply, the use of `run-all apply` or `apply-all` will silently add `-auto-approve`.

This appears to have been true for several years, but I saw no mention of it on this documentation page or anywhere outside of finding the original GitHub issue, so when I changed a workflow from `run-all apply` to just `apply` today it broke in a non-obvious way that I couldn't diagnose with the documentation...

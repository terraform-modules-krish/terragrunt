# read_terragrunt_config

**yorinasub17** commented *Feb 14, 2020*

This implements `read_terragrunt_config`, a helper function that can be used for reading in another terragrunt config and accessing its blocks and attributes for reuse.

This is one of the suggested improvements coming out of https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1025

### TODO

- [x] Update when https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1050 merges (there are some conflicts in that `generate` blocks will need to be added to the converter).

I believe I addressed all the comments, but given the complexity of the new tests, I rerequested a review.

> My only concern is about the maintainability of terragruntConfigAsCty... Or more accurately, of the 3-4 places we now have to update every time we add a new config option to Terragrunt.

Filed https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1055 so we don't forget this thought.

UPDATE: bfeab4c 

Added `generate` block and property to the output cty and updated the tests so that they pass and check that the block and property is accessible.

I also found a bug in the `generate` block where `comment_prefix` was ignored, so fixed that. 

Thanks for the review! Going to merge this in now!

# Configure remote state and download modules if necessary

**brikis98** commented *Jun 1, 2016*

This PR makes two changes:
1. Only configure remote state when necessary. The requirements are a) you’re calling a Terraform command that uses remote state and b) remote state is not already configured.
2. Download Terraform modules when necessary (using `terraform get`). The requirements are a) you’re calling a Terraform command that uses modules, b) there isn’t already a `.terraform/modules` folder, and c) your Terraform templates use modules.

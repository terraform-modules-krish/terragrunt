# Update glide.lock

**kevinburke** commented *Oct 31, 2017*

Generated this file by creating a new Git branch and running "glide
update". While none of the revision hashes changed, the subpackage
lists changed quite a bit, which leaves me a little confused.

Generated using glide version 0.13.0-dev.

Trying to merge this separately because I ran into a conflict in the `.lock` file attempting to add a dependency for #318.

Hmm, that is weird. I find glide very confusing :-\

Do the tests still pass?

Not sure, see https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/336.

Another option would be to check in the entire vendor directory, which would make the changes here more obvious, as they'd appear in the diff.

I'm not a big fan of checking in thousands of random Go src files. In fact, the sheer volume of code would likely make that diff even less useful than the `glide.lock` one.

Running tests on this...

These tests passed. Merging now.

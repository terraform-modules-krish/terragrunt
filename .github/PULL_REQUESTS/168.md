# Add a get_tfvars_dir helper (review, but do not merge)

**brikis98** commented *Apr 20, 2017*

This PR is a fix for #143. It adds a new helper called `get_tfvars_dir()` that makes it possible to use relative file paths with remote Terraform configurations. This should allow us to make our `.tfvars` files much more DRY, by defining commonly used variables (e.g. the AWS region, AWS account ID, etc) in a common `.tfvars` file and referencing it from all the others.  

Note that this PR is against the terraform-0.9 branch, so please review, but do not merge this one. Once #167 is merged, I’ll reopen this PR against master, and then it’ll be ready for merging.

@brikis98 FYI, I believe GitHub now lets you change the "comparison" branch of Pull Requests without having to close and open a new one.

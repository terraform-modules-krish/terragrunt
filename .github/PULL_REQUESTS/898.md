# Change order of parsing so that include is parsed first

**yorinasub17** commented *Oct 8, 2019*

This is a fix for https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/814#issuecomment-518919484. Specifically, right now due to the parsing order `get_parent_terragrunt_dir` does not work in `locals`. This breaks usage of locals to refactor out a path calculation that depends on the parent dir, such as getting a default `empty.yml` file in the workaround for merging in optional variables from the directory hierarchy.

Note that this is a **backwards incompatible** change, where you can no longer reference `locals` in `include`. However, this is probably a worthy tradeoff where we are trading the not so useful function of referencing `locals` in `include` blocks (which will in 80% of use cases be `find_in_parent_folders()`) with the ability to use `include` dependent functions in the parent `locals`.

# Bump sops from v3.7.0 to v3.7.2

Hi!

After hitting this error `Call to function "sops_decrypt_file" failed: Error getting data key: 0 successful groups required, got 0.` coming from the sops package. I have tried to upgrade the sops dependency and build the project and  It solves the issue. 

Fix the issue : #1486

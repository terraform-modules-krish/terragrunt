> Thanks for the PR! One thing that isn't clear to me is why this wasn't handled by [auto init](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/auto-init/)? Had you run `init` before, and then updated to a new version of Terraform? If so, and you already had a `.terraform` folder, then I guess Terragrunt would not have run `init` automatically, and therefore, wouldn't have copied the lock file.

This change is to explicitly support the flow described here https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/providers/lock.html#specifying-target-platforms.

`terraform init` is not guaranteed to pull all checksums depending on platforms, if you already have the provider requested in a cache, or if you are using a mirror. There are lots of details here https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27264#issuecomment-743389837. This extra sub command enables you to ensure that the lock file is fully populated.

Ohhh, I get it, thanks for the context! Could you add that to the comment above `shouldCopyLockFile` so future maintainers can see the context too?

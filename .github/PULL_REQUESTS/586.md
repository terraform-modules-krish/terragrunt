# Add a command that prints the temporary directory.

**tamsky** commented *Oct 11, 2018*

## What's changing

This PR adds a command `terragrunt-info` that intercepts normal operations but stops just after downloading source code.

## Why

After downloading sources (after `terragrunt init`), some automation may want a method for determining the download directory.

Fixes #352 

If additional work (eg: additional changes to README.md) are required, please let me know.

Thanks for the PR!

A few thoughts:

1. Would it make more sense to have something like a `terragrunt-info` command? It could print out in some machine-parseable format (JSON or just key:value pairs on new lines) a variety of useful info from Terragrunt: working dir, download dir, terraform binary path, env vars, etc. You could also run `terragrunt terragrunt-info xxx` to get just the info on `xxx`, analogous to how `terraform output` works.

1. Please add this to the docs and a corresponding automated test in `integration_test.go`.

I've recently pushed new commits to my branch, but they don't show up here.
Hm.

@brikis98 I like your proposal to make it similar to `terraform output` command. In fact, mirroring it even more closely would make this more usable in scripts, etc. (see [docs](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/output.html)).

## Proposed command ideas
Return just the value for the terragrunt download directory
```
$> terragrunt tg-info download_dir
```

Return all terragrunt info as key/value pairs, one per line
```
$> terragrunt tg-info
```

Return all terragrunt info in json format:
```
$> terragrunt tg-info -json
```

> Thanks! Could you add a simple test for this command in integration_test.go?

I have added a simple test for this command.

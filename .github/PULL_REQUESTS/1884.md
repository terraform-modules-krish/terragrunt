# Update aws-go-sdk to v1.41.7

**adrien-f** commented *Oct 21, 2021*

Greetings ðŸ‘‹ 

I've been experiencing a hard to debug issue which I think part of it is because of OSX network stack, part of it is our office network setup and part of it is in the aws-sdk-go:

```
2021/10/21 11:21:36 DEBUG: Send Request s3/HeadBucket failed, attempt 3/3, error RequestError: send request failed
caused by: Head "https://xxx.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/": EOF
error running head bucket: RequestError: send request failed
caused by: Head "https://xxx.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/": EOFRemote state S3 bucket xxx does not exist or you don't have permissions to access it. Would you like Terragrunt to create it? (y/n)
```

After building Terragrunt against the different versions of the SDK, I've noticed that the versions > `v1.41` resolve my issue so I suppose this can benefit others! 

The related changes: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/releases/tag/v1.41.0

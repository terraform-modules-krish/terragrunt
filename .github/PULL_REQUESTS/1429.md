# fix: Set Terraform plan file as last argument in apply-all

**amontalban** commented *Nov 13, 2020*

This PR should fix #1271 (The position of the Terraform plan file in the `apply-all` command).

I'm having the same problem as @ibacalu when running Terragrunt with:

```
  extra_arguments "save_plan" {
    commands = [
      "plan"
    ]

    arguments = [
      "-out=${get_terragrunt_dir()}/${trimspace(run_cmd("basename", "${get_terragrunt_dir()}"))}.tfplan"
    ]
  }

  extra_arguments "load_plan" {
    commands = [
      "apply"
    ]

    arguments = [
      "${get_terragrunt_dir()}/${trimspace(run_cmd("basename", "${get_terragrunt_dir()}"))}.tfplan"
    ]
  }
```

And then running `plan-all` and `apply-all` (I am aware that this is an antipattern as described by @yorinasub17 but I think it needs to be fixed anyway).

Thanks!

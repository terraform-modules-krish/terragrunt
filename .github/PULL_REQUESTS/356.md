# State locking no longer required or supported?

**mcameron** commented *Nov 9, 2017*

According to this issue: #125, state locking is no longer required or supported in terragrunt.

If that's the case, it's probably a good idea to pull the references for it out of the README.

Thanks for the PR, but I think there is a bit of confusion here. Let me try to clear it up.

Terraform did not used to do any sort of locking, so we did added support for locking in the first version of Terragrunt using DynamoDB. The latest versions of Terraform *do* support locking: e.g., the [S3 backend](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/s3.html) uses DynamoDB for locking, just like Terragrunt used to. So we removed the locking from Terragrunt, but Terragrunt still helps you [manage your backend (AKA remote state) configuration](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt#keep-your-remote-state-configuration-dry)! That configuration includes the [dynamodb_table configuration](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/s3.html#dynamodb_table)  natively supported by Terraform's locking. That also includes the ability to [create the S3 bucket and DynamoDB table automatically](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt#create-remote-state-and-locking-resources-automatically) if they don't exist already.

Therefore, I believe the docs are actually up to date.

Ok, I appreciate the feedback - terragrunt simply passes through that config for terraform to handle now rather than it being duplicated functionality.

This is why I was confused: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/269.

So terragrunt is responsible for _creating_ the dynamodb table which terraform then _uses_ to manage the locks.

Yes, exactly!

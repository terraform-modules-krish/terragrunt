# #1944 Updated logic to resolve full path on includes

**denis256** commented *Dec 15, 2021*

Updated module exclusion to first resolve path based on the module path, without this change, includes like bellow are ignored

```
app/terragrunt.hcl:

  include "incl" {
      path = "../parent.hcl"
  }

parent.hcl

locals {
    overwrite_var = run_cmd("echo", "parent hcl")
}

```

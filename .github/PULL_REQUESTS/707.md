# enables multiple includes

**twang817** commented *May 17, 2019*

Allows for multiple includes.  Should fix #303.

`path_relative_from_include()` and `path_relative_to_include` include tested.  Behavior should be to evaluate within the context of the included file.

Thanks for the PR! I'm a bit buried now and will review this later on to think through the implications.

How does this work with `*-all` commands?  Is there a way to either mark files as intermediary or mark them as leaves?

@twang817 When you get a chance, please rebased this PR on `master`. Note that in `v0.19.0`, Terragrunt config parsing had a major refactor to support Terraform 0.12 and move to HCL2.

Would be happy about this feature!

Until we get the `imports` block, I would be majorly super-duper happy to see it revisited!

It would be great to get this one merged. We want the child modules to include some extra files (that generate TF config) and that is not possible at present.

Hi, what is blocking to see this merged?

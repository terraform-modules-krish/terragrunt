# Check ${TF_DATA_DIR} when looking up Terraform state files

This prevents incessant reinitialization on every invocation of Terragrunt if
TF_DATA_DIR is set

Closes #838

Thanks! Kicking off tests now.

Failing test seems to be unrelated to my change.

OK, re-ran tests and they passed, so looks like it was some transient issue with S3. Merging now, thanks!

Thanks. Are binaries generated asynchronously, should I wait for them to appear on the releases page?

It takes the build ~10 min to run and upload the binaries. They should be there shortly.

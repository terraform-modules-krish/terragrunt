# Introduce concept of merge strategy for includes

**yorinasub17** commented *Jun 17, 2021*

This adds a new attribute `merge_strategy` to `include` blocks, allowing you to specify an `include` block without merging the config in. This can be used in conjunction with the new `expose` attribute to simulate `read_terragrunt_config` for certain use cases. Note that due to the limitation of single include blocks, it is not a full replacement for `read_terragrunt_config` (yet).

This PR also refactors the merge functionality of the config into a new `include.go` file. This is in preparation for the next PR after this one, which will introduce deep merge strategy.

# Faster dependency outputs

**yorinasub17** commented *Feb 5, 2021*

Fixes https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1322

This implements a further optimization to dependency output fetching, where if terragrunt detects that the target module is already initialized, the dependency fetcher will directly run `terraform output` instead of running `init`. This skips a relatively long operation, where terraform needs to pull down the providers and modules.

Note that to implement this, I needed to refactor the `TerraformSource` struct so that it is available in the `config` package without a circular dependency between `config` and `cli`. Everything in `cli/tfsource` are functions that were straight copied from `cli`, with a few exceptions where the functions were converted to methods.

(I was compelled to implement this because I noticed this `init` operation is SUPER SLOW for the account-baseline module, which we have dependency links to in the ref arch)

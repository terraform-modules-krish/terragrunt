# configure s3 client session to support force_path_style

**fosrias** commented *Sep 14, 2018*

@brikis98 This correctly implements `force_path_style`. It maintains all the current terragrunt functionality with the following changes:
1. It graciously fails if a third party s3 API does not support versioning
2. It allows other boolean configurations without incorrectly triggering an init everytime when comparing with string based existing configuration.

Relates to https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/565

This supports the following config:

```
terragrunt = {
  remote_state {
    backend = "s3"
    config {
      bucket   = "terraform-state2"
      key      = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
      region   = "us-west-2"
      encrypt  = true
      endpoint = "https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com"

      skip_region_validation      = true
      skip_credentials_validation = true
      skip_requesting_account_id  = true
      skip_get_ec2_platforms      = true
      skip_metadata_api_check     = true
      force_path_style            = true
    }
  }
```

I have not written tests, but will if you are comfortable with this. I have manually tested this on our third party object store and on AWS (with both regular and path style configuration).

Another issue is that Terraform has schema checking on `backend-config`, for example using v0.11.1, I got:

```
$ terragrunt init

[terragrunt] 2018/09/14 08:19:49 Hit multiple errors:

```
So, we can either trap this type of error in code and put a message about checking the Terraform version support for the config element or we we should put it in README or both. Thoughts?

Also, should I update the README to discuss this support for the other s3 options along the lines of the sample config above?

Also, `shared_credentials_file` does not work ATM. I planned to put that in another forthcoming PR, but could add it in this PR. It needs to get passed into the S3 client session for HeadBucket and GetBucketVersioning as well in like fashion to S3ForcePathStyle.

And finally, in the CreateS3Client function and CreateS3Session functions, there are a ton of arguments now. And will need one more for `shared_credentials_file`. I think we should just modify them using a struct and maybe pass in the struct with these items set and just use that. So you would have something like:

```
func CreateS3Client(config *ClientConfig, terragruntOptions *options.TerragruntOptions) (*s3.S3, error) {
...
}
```
Thoughts?

So, output is from Terraform and cannot parse the error string, so will have to add to documentation. Can't add in code. Will do that.

If you're putting elements in your config that your version of Terraform doesn't support, you should see that error. I don't think Terragrunt should do anything about it.

> Also, should I update the README to discuss this support for the other s3 options along the lines of the sample config above?

If it's already documented in the Terraform S3 backend config, no need to duplicate in Terragrunt configs, unless we're doing something different with it.

Another PR is prob best. Thanks 👍

Yup, seems like a good idea!

@brikis98 This should do it for this PR. Address prior comments.

Thanks. Your welcome. This is a great tool, so happy to help.

Ran `make fmt` (using vscode so reformats continuously, and not changes with `make fmt`) and ran all the tests:
```
$ sudo go test ./...

I am going to whip up the `shared_credentials_file` fix immediately, FYI.

Great, thanks! Merging now. I'll let the tests run and once they pass, I'll create a new release, and paste the link here.

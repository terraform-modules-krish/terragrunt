# Load .terragrunt file relative to working dir

**brikis98** commented *Dec 21, 2016*

This fixes a bug where Terragrunt’s default path for the config file is `.terragrunt` in the current working directory rather than the working directory specified by the `—terragrunt-working-dir` parameter.

LGTM! I appreciate your fixing this. I was in a rush so worked around it and wasn't sure if it was an official bug.

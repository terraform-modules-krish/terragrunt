# Fix the prevent_default flag functionality

**alexkayabula** commented *Jun 19, 2020*

### What does this PR do?
- This PR provides a fix for issue [1217](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1217).
### Description of task to be completed?
- The issue was that the ```child``` module configuration was not configured to override the `prevent_destroy` flag in the `parent` `terragrunt.hcl` file for the destroy commands to destroy resources . 

- It is important to not that the `find_in_parent_folders()` helper in the `child` module automatically searches up the directory tree to find the `parent` `terragrunt.hcl` file and inherit the `remote_state` configuration from it. 
- So for the `terragrunt detroy` command to actually destroy resources of the `child` module with `prevent_destroy` flag set to `false`, the `prevent_destroy = true` flag in the `parent` `terragrunt.hcl` file has to be overriden.

@brikis98, with reference to the [repro](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1217#issuecomment-644618776) of the bug,  
I think `test/fixture-prevent-destroy/child/terragrunt.hcl` should be created with `prevent_destroy = false` other than `prevent_destroy = true` like you had suggested.

Yes, sorry, copy/paste error in my comment! Just updated my comment to clear that up.

Looks like there was a compile error:

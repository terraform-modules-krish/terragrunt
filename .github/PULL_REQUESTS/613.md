# Fix potential concurrency bug in RunShellCommandWithOutput

**brikis98** commented *Nov 24, 2018*

This hopefully fixes #611. In `RunShellCommandWithOutput`, we were writing both `stdout` and `stderr` to a single `bytes.Buffer`. Since `bytes.Buffer` is not guaranteed to be goroutine-safe, it's possible this was sometimes causing a race condition where some of the output was lost or overwritten, which led to weird behavior downstream. In this PR, I update `RunShellCommandWithOutput` to use two `bytes.Buffer`, one for stdout and one for stderr.

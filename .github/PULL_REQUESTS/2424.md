## Description

Reverts #2387. The [tflint-ruleset-aws-cis](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/tflint-ruleset-aws-cis) is now opensource so we won't have issues running it in the ECS Deploy Runner.

Now, Tflint will only recognize private GitHub repos based on the token in `GITHUB_TOKEN` (as it's default behaviour).

The test failure is in `TestTerragruntStackCommands`. I will merge this PR as it is since it's not related.

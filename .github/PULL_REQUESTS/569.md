# Shared credentials file support

**fosrias** commented *Sep 15, 2018*

Supports user specified credentials file location for terragrunt-specific calls to object store. Formatted and all tests passing.

You will want to review this after merging https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/567, but all changes in 07c1db3 here, regardless.

@brikis98 BTW, how long does it typically take you to get around updating `brew` with the new release?

The community actually does all the homebrew updating for us! See https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/551.

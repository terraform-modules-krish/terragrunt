# Add Ignore external dependencies flag

**gpiper14** commented *Mar 20, 2019*

Adds a `--terragrunt-ignore-external-dependencies` argument that will not prompt the user if they want to include an external dependency.  This is useful if you just need to run a targeted subset of modules of a larger config

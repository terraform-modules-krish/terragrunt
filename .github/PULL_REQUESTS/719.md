# Check to see if symlinks are directories

**dmyerscough** commented *May 30, 2019*

Verify if a symlink is a directory and copy the file correctly. Before this patch you would receive the following for symlinks:-

```
[terragrunt] [/Users/damianmyerscough/Development/panw/panw/infra/network/us/dev/vpcs] 2019/05/30 14:28:19 Ignoring error from call to init, as this is a known Terraform bug: https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/18460
[terragrunt] 2019/05/30 14:28:19 Copying files from /Users/damianmyerscough/Development/panw/panw/infra/network/us/dev/vpcs into /Users/damianmyerscough/Development/panw/panw/infra/network/us/dev/vpcs/.terragrunt-cache/5oHzwSSOmD3uGskQ_bC74SZOJwc/XEQVXshD_EJIaErY-io8P3Sp52Y
[terragrunt] 2019/05/30 14:28:19 read /Users/damianmyerscough/Development/panw/panw/infra/network/us/dev/vpcs/test: is a directory
[terragrunt] 2019/05/30 14:28:19 Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1
```

```bash
$ ls -l test

No problem @Etiene I noticed the failed integration tests look unrelated to my change:-

```
* null_resource.tf_retryable_error: Error running command 'echo 'Failed to load backend: Error configuring the backend 's3': RequestError: send request failed caused by: Post https://sts.amazonaws.com/: net/http: TLS handshake timeout' && exit 1': exit status 1. Output: Failed to load backend: Error configuring the backend s3: RequestError: send request failed caused by: Post https://sts.amazonaws.com/: net/http: TLS handshake timeout
```

I re-run the tests and they pass now. The previous failure was likely due to an intermittent failure with AWS.

@Etiene do you know when a new Terragrunt release will be made with this change? I would like to consume the build from the releases page rather than using my locally built version

# Some typo fixes

**udondan** commented *Nov 27, 2018*

Just some typo fixes I noticed while reading through the readme.

It appears like 90% line trimming, which I hope is ok. I *could* change that but I think it's not a bad thing. Most folks auto-trim their code today. Changing it now prevents this kind of changes in future whenever someone touches the readme.

# get_aws_caller_identity_arn and get_aws_caller_identity_user_id functions

**mcalhoun** commented *Oct 7, 2019*

This PR:
* adds new `get_aws_caller_identity_arn` and `get_aws_caller_identity_user_id` functions that will return the ARN and UserId, respectively, of the currently configured user or IAM role similar to the existing `get_aws_account` function.
* updates the circle config to run unit and integration tests in parallel to save times on each CI run

In doing my own code review, I realized my example doesn't make any sense...I'll update that

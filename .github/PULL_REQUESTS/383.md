Thanks for the PR! The change looks good. Could you paste the output from running the tests? Unfortunately, we can't run our CI for external PRs automatically due to security concerns.

I just ran the ones for `remote`, but if needed I can run the full test suite...
``` bash
terragrunt $ cd remote && go test -v -parallel 128

Could you run all the tests please? It should only take a 1-2 min or so. Thank you!

**TimJones** commented *Nov 27, 2017*

Do the tests incur a cost for my AWS account? I notice they use DynomoDB and my AWS credentials...
***

**brikis98** commented *Nov 27, 2017*

The tests create S3 buckets and DynamoDB tables, write some data to them, and then clean them up again. If you're still eligible for the free tier, this shouldn't cost you anything. If you're not, it'll cost you some fractions of a cent for S3 usage (DynamoDB's always has a free tier, so that still shouldn't cost anything). If you're not comfortable with that, let me know.

I'm having issues running the tests. We use MFA even with AWS-CLI, and setting the environment variables doesn't seem to be enough for the tests. All calls to AWS fail.
***

**brikis98** commented *Nov 27, 2017*

Setting env vars correctly with MFA is tricky. We even built a tool for it :-D

Anyways, I'll merge this in and see if the tests pass. Worst case, I'll revert it.

**brikis98** commented *Nov 27, 2017*

The tests passed. New release is here: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.13.22. The binaries should show up in a few minutes. Thanks again for the fix!

**TimJones** commented *Nov 28, 2017*

Awesome! Is the MFA CLI tool publicly available?? Sounds useful!
***

**brikis98** commented *Nov 28, 2017*

No, it's currently only available for Gruntwork customers.

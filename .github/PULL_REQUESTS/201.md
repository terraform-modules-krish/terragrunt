# Fix problem on Windows with temp directory name encoding

**jocgir** commented *Apr 29, 2017*

I just found out that there is a bug on Windows.

The algorithm used to encode directory name use a base 64 encoding. But this generates names with non alphanumeric characters that are invalid for some command on Windows.

When we call `terraform get`, it tries to issue a `mklink` command to link the `.terraform\modules\<tempname>` to the actual module source folder. Since `terragrunt` is working in a temp directory with mangled names containing invalid characters (especially the = at the end), that cause the `mklink` command to fail on windows.

Also, I fixed a problem with `RunShellCommandAndCaptureOutput()`. In case of error, this function didn't return any captured output. I think the function should returns the captured buffer in any circumstance otherwise, we are loosing the output to stderr.

@jocgir Looks like this PR causes some test failures:

```

My guess is that all of these tests have a base64 hash in them that needs to be updated to the new encoding. Could you take a look?

# Add ability to set terragrunt-working-dir with env var TERRAGRUNT_WORKING_DIR

**yorinasub17** commented *Jun 25, 2020*

Bonus features:

- Update reference docs to include env vars at the top for easier readability
- `TERRAGRUNT_CHECK` was parsed incorrectly (it would enable the flag when it was set to `false` as opposed to `true`).

# Output run-all plan errors

**boekkooi-fresh** commented *Mar 24, 2021*

By using a [`io.MultiWriter`](https://golang.org/pkg/io/#MultiWriter) terraform errors and hook output is printed/output to stdErr.
This makes debugging of a hook and terraform easier because errors are no longer swallowed.
It also makes `terragrunt run-all plan` act the same in regards to output as `terragrunt plan`.

In my case having the terraform output while running terragrunt is very helpful since we have more then 900+ terraform things being called in some cases.

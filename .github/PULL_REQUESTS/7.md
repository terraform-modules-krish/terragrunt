# Refactor error handling. Add comments.

**brikis98** commented *Jun 1, 2016*

**Note**: This PR is the same as #4, but this time, opened against master. Since #4 was already reviewed, I’m going to merge this one in immediately.
1. Refactor error handling to a) use custom types for our own errors
   and b) include a stacktrace with all errors. This is a first pass at PT Ticket [#119003093](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/119003093), "Standardize on go-errors for error handling in our Go code". The fact that with Go you have to put in a bunch of work to get stack traces is sad. Also, defining custom error types takes too much damn code, although it's worth it, as it helped me fix one bug already.
2. Update tests to look for specific error types instead of simply
   checking an error is or isn’t nil.
3. Add comments through out the code.

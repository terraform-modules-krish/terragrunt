# Add prevent_destroy flag

**ozerovandrei** commented *Jul 15, 2018*

Add boolean flag to protect selected Terraform resources.

For #489

@brikis98 Hello.

I started working on this for the issue #489 and I want to ask how to better deal with this configuration parameter.

As far as I understand, it's better to use the Terraform's native `prevent_destroy` [lifetime flag](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#prevent_destroy)?
If so, better way to do it is to pass 
```
lifecycle {
  prevent_destroy = true
}
```
to all of resources that are declared in the modules if user provided
```
terragrunt {
  prevent_destroy = true
}
```

Am I thinking into right direction?

@ozerovandrei Thanks for taking a crack at this! This would be a very useful feature.

The code looks good so far. I think the next step is to check which Terraform command is being executed by the user, and if it is `destroy`, and `prevent_destroy` is set to `true`, just log a message explaining this module is protected (and the user can only destroy it by removing the `prevent_destroy` flag), and gracefully exit. I don't think you need to integrate with Terraform's `prevent_destroy`, as that is on a per-resource basis, and it would be very tricky to make it work.

@brikis98 thank you for the explanation.

What about `destroy-all` command? Does check need to be added to this command too?
***

**brikis98** commented *Jul 15, 2018*

`destroy-all` eventually goes through the same code path as `destroy`, so as long as you put your check in the right place, it'll work automatically for `destroy-all` too :)

@brikis98 seems that I found a right place to put my checks ðŸ˜„ 

I've noticed lack of `cli/cli_app_test.go` file to test methods of the `cli_app.go`. Can I create such file to add a test for my new method? Or you have some different plans to test `cli_app`?

Aside from tests this PR only needs documentation updates for a new configuration parameter. So it's almost ready for a full review.

Sure! If there are unit tests that make sense to add for `cli_app.go`, putting them in `cli_app_test.go` makes sense. If they are more integration tests (i.e., they run the whole app, rather than executing a function or two), those should go under `test/integration_test.go`, which has quite a few integration tests already.

Fantastic. Let me know when it's ready. Thanks!

**ozerovandrei** commented *Jul 16, 2018*

@brikis98 I've decided to add just a single integration test with a fixture.

This PR is ready for review.

Hm, weird. `TestPreventDestroyDependencies` is failing consistently in CircleCI... But when I run it locally, it passes... I'll have to look into this tomorrow.

@ozerovandrei Apologies for the delay on this. I'm traveling this whole week and won't be able to dig into this test failure for until I'm back. If you're able to repro it locally and have any idea of the cause in the meantime, let me know! This is a great feature and I want to get it released as soon as I can, but sometimes things get a bit busy, so thank you for your patience.

**ozerovandrei** commented *Jul 25, 2018*

@brikis98 I'll try to look into it, sure.

OK, finally had time to sit down and figure this one out. Turns out that there was a bug in the file copying code which prevented the `terraform.tfvars` files from being copied when running in CircleCI, as the `GOPATH` in CircleCi is in a folder with a dot in it  (`~/.go_workspace`). Fix: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/commit/0bdb5f9ebbcad4ebe2c104bb1c51c186d3ad10f7.

Release with this new feature: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.16.4. New binaries should show up shortly.

@brikis98 that's great news, thank you for review and debugging ðŸ˜„

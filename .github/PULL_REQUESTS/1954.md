# add repo path functions

**tbell83** commented *Dec 17, 2021*

This PR adds two functions, `get_path_to_repo_root()` and `get_path_from_repo_root()`, loosely linked to https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/305

Thanks for addressing the comments and apologies for the delay in getting to this. I've been buried with other tasks and only now getting back to terragrunt again.

The updates LGTM! I'll kick off a regression build and if it passes, we can merge this in.

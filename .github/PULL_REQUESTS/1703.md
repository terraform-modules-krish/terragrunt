Looks like there is a build failure. Specifically, the check at https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/pull-request-1703/test/integration_test.go#L1502 and https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/pull-request-1703/test/integration_test.go#L1711 are failing with:

```
Object expected to be of type multierror.Error, but was *multierror.Error

```

# #1788 Verification if module source point to existing directory

**denis256** commented *Sep 6, 2021*

Updated source downloading logic to verify if module directory actually exists

Example:
```

$ cat terragrunt.hcl
terraform {
  source = "git::ssh://git@github.com/denis256/internal-terragrunt-test-cases.git//module-666/invalid-path?ref=main"
}

$ terragrunt init
ERRO[0001] Working dir module-666/invalid-path from source git::ssh://git@github.com/denis256/internal-terragrunt-test-cases.git?ref=main does not exist 
ERRO[0001] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1 


```

Included changes:
 * Added verification of terraformSource.WorkingDir after downloading of sources
 * Added test cases

Fix for issue: #1788

Looks like a pre-commit check failed:

```
goimports................................................................Failed
- hook id: goimports
- files were modified by this hook

cli/download_source.go
cli/download_source_test.go
```

I think you need to run `goimports`.

Fixed, will try to make GoLand do `goimports` automatically
***

**brikis98** commented *Sep 9, 2021*

Tests passed! Merging now.

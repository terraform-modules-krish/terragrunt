# Update repo to use TF 0.13

**brikis98** commented *Sep 17, 2020*

1. Update CI to use latest Docker image, which has TF 0.13 installed.
1. Add pre-commit hooks to run `terraform fmt` and `go fmt`. 
1. Fix formatting on all `terraform fmt` issues.
1. Add `-auto-approve` to all the integration tests. How on earth did it work without this before???
1. Remove a trailing space from the `command` passed to `runTerragrunt` in a bunch of tests in `integration_test.go`. Under the hood, `runTerragrunt` calls `strings.Split` to split the `command` into a bunch of CLI args, and with the trailing space, it was passing it as an explicit arg... Terraform, in turn, was interpreting this as the folder path where it should run. Of course, a folder called space (`" "`) doesn't exist, so you get a super confusing test failure about `stat: no such file or directory` with no more information.

I'm super confused how the tests in `integration_test.go` were working before... Or if they were working at all... But all tests are passing now and this is ready for review!

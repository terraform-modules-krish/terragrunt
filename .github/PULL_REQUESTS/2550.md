## Description

Fixes #1997.
Fixes #2477.

Based on #2052.

- Change the scope to `ScopeFullControl` for label updates. (refer to [here](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/d360c6ca670e914b38cd6f5dc48433234064fea0/remote/remote_state_gcs.go#L460-L461))
- Implement test for the following scenario.

### Test senario

#### Preparation

1. Prepare the following two service accounts.
`Account A`: Terragrunt test runner account. This requires storage administrator privileges.
`Account B`: Impersonation test runner account. This requires token creation privileges without storage admin privileges.
2. Set the following environment variables.

| Name  | Value | Note |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS  | path to service account key json of `Account A` | (Optional) [Not required in either case](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials?hl=en)<br>- User credentials set up by using the Google Cloud CLI<br>- The attached service account, returned by the metadata server
| GCLOUD_SERVICE_KEY_IMPERSONATOR | service account key json content of `Account B` |
| GOOGLE_IDENTITY_EMAIL | e-mail address of `Account A`  |

#### Execution

1.  Change runner account to `Account B`.
2.  Run terragrunt without impersonation.
3.  Confirm failure to create backend bucket.
4.  Run terragrunt with impersonation. (impersonate `account A`)
5.  Confirm successful to create backend bucket.

Thank you for your review!

>Noticed failed integration tests:

Maybe you don't have enough environment variables set.
I added an environment variable check to my test code.

Definitely GCP environment variables should be added to CICD
Also, [documentation](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/tree/master/docs) should be updated to list required environment variables
***

**yamadayutaka** commented *May 9, 2023*

Changed to set the contents of the service account key to an environment variable considering running in CICD.
Along with that, I changed the environment variable name.
Also added processing to revert to default credentials before validation.

Sorry, I couldn't find any documentation that lists the environment variables required for integration testing.
Could you tell me where in the documentation I should update?

**findmyname666** commented *May 29, 2023*

Is there anything I can help with to get PR reviewed & merged pls ?

FYI We cannot upgrade Terragrunt because impersonation is broken in GCP.

Thx a lot.

Is this PR still waiting on the [documentation update](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/2550#issuecomment-1539288019)? We would like to adopt terragrunt, but this bug is a show-stopper since our backends all use impersonation to switch to a Terraform service account.

This PR has not passing integration tests:

```

    integration_serial_test.go:369: Required environment variable `GCLOUD_SERVICE_KEY_IMPERSONATOR` - not found

```

**jmesterh** commented *Jun 29, 2023*

It is not passing integration tests because the CICD attached to this repo needs to be updated to include a second service account key. Yamadayutaka mentioned that above and in the [test code](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/7956720c2c9cc4a17fb6d8de61a54494e4962655/test/integration_serial_test.go#L362). I assume this is something that must be done by a project admin who has access to the CircleCI account attached to this repo?

**Pardeep009** commented *Jul 12, 2023*

Hi @denis256 any updates on this, we are also blocked on using the latest terraform version in our environment because of this broken impersonation thing, do anyone here know other way-out for using the latest terraform version using terragrunt ?
***

**cmeury** commented *Jul 26, 2023*

Do I understand correctly, the "only" thing missing is a second service account key in the Circle CI configuration (as per [this comment](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/2550#issuecomment-1612426893)?

**denis256** commented *Jul 26, 2023*

Hello,
yes, I asked for help with adding an additional service account to CICD pipeline which will be used in impersonation tests

**robmorgan** commented *Aug 14, 2023*

Sorry for the delay on our side. I've added the `GCLOUD_SERVICE_KEY_IMPERSONATOR` environment variable to our CI/CD pipeline, but I still have an issue running the tests. Here is the output:

Hi @robmorgan, Thank you for trying.

The first call of terragrunt should result in an error, could you try waiting a little longer without interrupting?

And perhaps the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable is set incorrectly.
The CI/CD pipeline outputs the value of the GCLOUD_SERVICE_KEY environment variable to a file and sets it to the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable, so I think the same setting is necessary when running tests on the command line.

https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml#L95-L97

For example, as follows.
```
echo $GCLOUD_SERVICE_KEY > ${HOME}/gcloud-service-key.json
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=${HOME}/gcloud-service-key.json
go test -v -run TestTerragruntWorksWithImpersonateGCSBackend 
```

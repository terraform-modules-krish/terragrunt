# Add parameter to merge mocked outputs with the state outputs

**gregorycuellar** commented *Jul 31, 2021*

Add parameter to merge mocked outputs with the state outputs

- Adding a parameter, with explicit name => merge_state_and_mocks_outputs
- As default is should be set to false
- If true, terragrunt will add missing mocks, in the state outputs

In order to fix
#940

Ok the build failed, but the test failure is because of the branch name and not related to this PR, so we can go ahead and merge this in!

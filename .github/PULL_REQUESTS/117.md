# Add a --terragrunt-source-update flag

**brikis98** commented *Feb 1, 2017*

In https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/114, I added the ability for Terraform to cache the temporary folder so we don’t have to redownload code unnecessarily. This PR adds a new flag that I (naively) hoped wouldn’t be necessary: `—terragrunt-source-update`. This flag is a bit like the `-update` flag in terraform. It deletes the temporary folder before downloading into it.

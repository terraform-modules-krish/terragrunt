# Add Terragrunt integration test for latest Terraform.

**josh-padnick** commented *Aug 5, 2016*

This PR adds a simple integration test to validate that Terragrunt works with the latest version of Terraform. It executes a trivial Terraform template that just renders a `data.template_file` resource.

Do NOT merge this PR until https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-ci/pull/6 is merged and a new release is tagged in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-ci since running this integration test successfully depended on an update to `configure-environment-for-gruntwork-module` in github.com/gruntwork-io/module-ci.

Now that https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-ci/pull/6 is merged, tests are passing, so merging.

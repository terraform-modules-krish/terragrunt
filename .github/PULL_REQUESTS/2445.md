# Bug/support running apply destroy in reverse order

**jlepere-everlaw** commented *Feb 10, 2023*

## Description

Invert module group ordering for `apply -destroy` commands, mirroring the functionality for `destroy` commands.

## Testing
This has been tested by:
- [x] `$ go test -v ./...`
- [x] Validating the group ordering is now correct with `$ go run main.go run-all apply -destroy --terragrunt-working-dir ...`

## TODOs
I'm not sure if documentation should be updated. Maybe somewhere [here](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/execute-terraform-commands-on-multiple-modules-at-once/)?

## Release Notes (draft)

Added support for inverting module group ordering for `apply -destroy` commands.

@denis256, do you mind rerunning the tests? I don't believe I have access to.

I was wondering in which case is required to invert module group ordering?
In case if is required to destroy first and apply back modules?

I think we want to invert on any "destroy", right? `destroy` is [actually an alias for `apply -destroy`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/destroy).

We are running into this same issue. Our workflows perform a "run-all plan" with the destroy option and then use the "destroy" plan generated to do a "run-all apply", which should delete module state in the reverse order in which they were created. I posted issue https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/2453 on this yesterday. I will close that issue as I can see you are already working on this problem.

# fix config remote state s3 and update if needs

**leonardobiffi** commented *Apr 11, 2022*

Hi, this PR is a suggestion to resolve the KMS config when the bucket is created, as the default key KMS ID is not being informed, the bucket has encryption enabled but without the KMS:

I am also suggesting an important change so that buckets that do not comply with the default encryption settings, public access blocking, bucket policy (enforce SSL only), access logging, versioning enabled are updated according to what is defined in the block of config. The `disable_bucket_update` attribute disable this behavior for anyone managing the bucket outside of terragrunt. This change causes the buckets to be updated when running terragrunt to conform to the config that are already made when the bucket is created.

Another fix is for the bucket policy, where currently only EnforcedTLS is being defined, the first policy configured for RootAccess is overwritten.
What I changed is to check the policy already configured and be attached to the existing one, as shown in the image below

Closes #1770 
Closes #1143 
Closes #1106

Noticed that integration tests failed, each run different tests, I was wondering merge from master(to include https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/2073) will help tests to pass

@denis256 Hi, 
Did this change in the integration test work?
Do I need to change something in PR?
***

**denis256** commented *Apr 26, 2022*

@leonardobiffi try to merge the last changes from master and we will see if it will help to pass more integration tests

**denis256** commented *Apr 27, 2022*

Build passed :+1:

@denis256 when this PR will be release?

**denis256** commented *May 3, 2022*

Hi, I think this week, I was doing more tests to see if will appear any issue when switching from older versions

@denis256 awesome, let me known if anything is wrong

Noticed that still fail test `TestTerragruntStackCommands`, 3 runs - 3 failures:

Can be a concurrency issue? when multiple tests try to change S3 configuration?

@denis256 Hi, i fixed this error and the test passed. Can you validate?

See here this error message: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/blob/main/service/s3control/errors.go#L50
***

**denis256** commented *May 6, 2022*

I see the build started to pass, I'm still somehow suspect since the last change is to shallow NoSuchPublicAccessBlockConfiguration error, and before last change individual run of `TestTerragruntStackCommands` passed but it failed when the entire `integration_test.go` was executed

**leonardobiffi** commented *May 9, 2022*

@denis256 Hi,
The `integration_test.go` still failing because of update in s3?
I couldn`t see circleCI pipeline
***

**denis256** commented *May 9, 2022*

Hi, tests are passing all, I was wondering if is a good solution to [shallow error NoSuchPublicAccessBlockConfiguration](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/2063/commits/bba4beabf509161f99df0b29a47971b24978cf3d#diff-345e9cbcc2ee6f8ec2d5e8b20eca286f240ac84f31b7c377a31b17b5b2aed8a1R1144)

@denis256 
Looking at this aws doc, I understood that this error happens for accounts that don't have the option to configure S3 PublicAccess at the account level

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/s3control/#S3Control.GetPublicAccessBlock
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/configuring-block-public-access-account.html

What do you think?
***

**denis256** commented *May 10, 2022*

Hello,
error make sense to handle for buckets without PublicAccess configured, 
but it doesn't explain why individual execution of `TestTerragruntStackCommands` pass successfully, but run of entire integration tests fails on `TestTerragruntStackCommands` (all this before commit with handling of error), so far I think it is an issue of tests not of implementation and can be handled in other PR

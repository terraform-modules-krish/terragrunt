This one seems to be failing due to `go.sum` [mismatches](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/867/workflows/e1f61c5e-1926-4f38-af63-1a4ce920a0d6/jobs/6946) which should be fixable by running all the specified `go get` commands perhaps followed by `go mod tidy`.

Thanks, Zack - giving this a go now :)

I don't know why this keeps failing - I addresses the missing variables and ran `go mod tidy`.... I feel uncomfortable publishing it if we've got failing tests all unexpectedly.

Merging with master now, and let's see where the tests land.

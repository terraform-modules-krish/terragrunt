## Description
After more longer tests found that approach to setting encryption on access logs bucket can be improved, after more tests found that is enough to set(ASES256)/disable encryption on the logs bucket.

| State encryption  | Access log encryption  | Logs are generated to access log bucket?  |
|---|---|---|
| KMS | KMS  | No  |
| KMS | AES256 (SSE-S3)  | Yes  |
| KMS | Disabled  | Yes  |
| AES256 (SSE-S3) | KMS  | No  |
| AES256 (SSE-S3) | AES256 (SSE-S3)  | Yes  |
| AES256 (SSE-S3) | Disabled  | Yes  |
| Disabled | KMS  | No  |
| Disabled | AES256 (SSE-S3)  | Yes  |
| Disabled | Disabled  | Yes  |

Included changes:
 * if `accesslogging_bucket_name` is defined, set predefined `AES256` encryption on access bucket
 * if `skip_bucket_ssencryption` is defined, disable encryption on access logs bucket
 * removed user notification about wrong SSE algorithm since value is controller by Terragrunt(AES256 or Disabled)

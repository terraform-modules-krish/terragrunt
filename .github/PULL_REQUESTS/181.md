# Backend config should use proper types, including bool for encrypt

**brikis98** commented *Apr 23, 2017*

This is a fix for #179. While Terragruntâ€™s original `remote_state` config used solely strings, the `backend` config in Terraform 0.9 uses proper types, including `bool` for the `encrypt` parameter. This PR updates `remote_state` to use a `bool` for `remote_state`.

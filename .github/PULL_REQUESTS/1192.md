# Adds `terragrunt_version_constraint` functionality

**jakauppila** commented *May 22, 2020*

Adds the ability to define a `terragrunt_version_constraint` within the Terragrunt configuration.

Since we're dependent on the version fed in via the build process, I assume we really shouldn't have to worry about it not being parsable? If it does encounter an issue, currently have it defaulting to "0.0"; while not ideal, it's probably better than just erroring out.

Are there any additional tests to add?

Fixes #849

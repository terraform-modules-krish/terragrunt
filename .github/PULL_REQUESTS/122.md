# Read configuration from terraform.tfvars

**brikis98** commented *Feb 5, 2017*

This PR changes Terragrunt so that, by default, it reads its configuration from `terraform.tfvars` instead of `.terragrunt`. The reasons for this change are:

1. We piggyback on top of a file format Terraform users are already used to.
1. We reduce the number of files you need. This is especially valuable with [remote Terraform configurations](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt#remote-terraform-configurations), as it means you only need a single `terraform.tfvars` file to define what code to download and provide the variables for that code.

For backwards compatibility, Iâ€™ve made sure that Terragrunt can still use `.terragrunt` files as before, though it will now log a deprecation warning. 

Note, this is a long PR, but just about all of the important stuff is in two files: `README.md` and `config.go`. Please focus your code review efforts there. The rest of the changes are:

1. Test code to check the new functionality.
1. Test code to check backwards compatibility with the old `.terragrunt` configuration format.
1. Updating lots of comments, docs, and test cases to not explicitly say `.terragrunt`. We had that copy/pasted in too many places.
1. An unrelated change regarding filepaths. We need to use `util.JoinPath` for paths to work correctly on all platforms. I should've done this fix as a separate PR, but got impatient.

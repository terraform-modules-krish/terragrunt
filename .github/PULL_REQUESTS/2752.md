# `sops_decrypt_file()`: resolve path argument relative to `terragrunt.hcl`

## Description

Update path resolution logic in `sops_decrypt_file()` to resolve relative path arguments relative to the file containing the call to `sops_decrypt_file()`, rather than relative to the working directory of the Terragrunt process.

This change should be invisible for the common case of running Terragrunt directly inside the directory containing `terragrunt.hcl`. However, it enables intuitive use of `terragrunt run-all` with `sops_decrypt_file()`, ensuring configurations behave the same, no matter if they're evaluated directly or under `run-all`.

An additional test case for `sops_decrypt_file()` was added that validates its behavior in combination with `run-all`.

## Release Notes (draft)

<!-- One-line description of the PR that can be included in the final release notes. -->
Updated `sops_decrypt_file()` path resolution to be relative to `terragrunt.hcl` instead of Terragrunt's working directory.

### Migration Guide

<!-- Important: If you made any backward incompatible changes, then you must write a migration guide! -->

If you were relying on the behavior of `terragrunt run-all` on a set of modules using `sops_decrypt_file()` using a file in the current working directory, such as a shared secret, you can wrap the argument to `sops_decrypt_file()` in a call to `find_in_parent_folders()`, as shown in the documentation for `sops_decrypt_file()`.

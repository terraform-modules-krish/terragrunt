# Multiple include blocks

**yorinasub17** commented *Sep 10, 2021*

This is the implementation of the feature described in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1803

This is backward compatible for the most part, except for the expose feature, where you must now index into the label - any prior references to exposed `include` must be updated to `include[""]`. E.g., if the user had:

```hcl
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
  expose = true
}

inputs = {
  region = include.locals.region
}
```
the `include.locals.region` reference must be updated to `include[""].locals.region`.
```hcl
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
  expose = true
}

inputs = {
  region = include[""].locals.region
}
```

Thanks for review! Will merge this in, cut a new release as backward compatible (given how much code change there is to the `include` machinery), and then open a follow up PR to update that function docs.

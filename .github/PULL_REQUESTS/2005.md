# Handle relative paths correctly when fetching tfr

**yorinasub17** commented *Jan 31, 2022*

Fixes https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/2003

This updates the relative path handling to use the same approach that terraform uses internally by relying on the `URL` struct to combine reference paths, instead of manually doing it.

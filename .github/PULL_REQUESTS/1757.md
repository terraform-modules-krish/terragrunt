# Introduce --terragrunt-strict flag for validate-inputs

**zackproser** commented *Jul 26, 2021*

Fixes https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1603

These changes introduce the `--terragrunt-strict-validate` flag which enables the behavior outlined [here](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1603#issuecomment-805944075). 

By default, terragrunt's `validate-inputs` command runs in relaxed mode. In relaxed mode, `validate-inputs` only returns an error if there are required inputs that are missing. 

By passing `--terragrunt-strict-validate`, strict mode is enabled. When strict mode is enabled, Terragrunt will return an error if any required inputs are missing, OR if any variables that are passed in a Terragrunt configuration are NOT used in the underlying Terraform configuration.

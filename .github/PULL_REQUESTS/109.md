# Allow explicitly setting up the remote state

**Bowbaq** commented *Jan 25, 2017*

This adds a new `setup-state` command which basically only runs `configureRemoteState`. This allows explicitly pulling down the remote state (in a CI environment for example) without other side effects.

Our use case is that we use some values from the state to configure the application layer (DNS names, things like that). Running `terragrunt output <some output>` works, however it writes a bunch of "logs" to `stdout`, so a script doing something like `DNS_NAME="$(terragrunt output dns_name)" ends up with unexpected values.

We currently run a `terragrunt validate` beforehand to pull down the state, but it feels a bit hacky.

What version of Terragrunt are you using? As of [v0.8.0](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.8.0), all of Terragrunt's logs go to `stderr`. Or are you saying that the logs from Terraform's `remote config` command are getting in the way?

It's the latter. I guess another solution would be to fix that instead.

If you redirect the `remote config` logs to `stderr` when Terragrunt is executing it, will that fix your issue? If so, that might be simpler than adding (and then maintaining) a whole new command.

It would fix the issue. I still find it strange that there is no way to explicitly setup the remote state without side effects (unless I overlooked one?)

I agree there should be some sort of `init` command for Terragrunt. It came up in #107 as well. See my [latest comment](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/107#issuecomment-274973923) for some ideas on what that command could look like.

Since #110 was merged, I'm going to close this. I'm still open to PRs for some sort of `terragrunt-init` command as discussed in #107.

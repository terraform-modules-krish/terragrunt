## Description

Improved setting of source code changes locks to lock execution of `tflint` hooks instead of all hooks which reduced performance.


Tests on my environment:
```
# before changes
$ time terragrunt  run-all plan --terragrunt-log-level=debug >out.v0.custom 2>&1  

real    2m40.836s
user    1m23.821s
sys     0m47.366s

# after changes
$ time /projects/gruntwork/terragrunt/terragrunt  run-all plan --terragrunt-log-level=debug >out.v0.custom 2>&1 

real    0m20.176s
user    1m25.956s
sys     0m46.518s
```

Fixes #2480.

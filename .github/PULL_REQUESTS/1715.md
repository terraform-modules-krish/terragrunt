# Better error message for aws-provider-patch

**yorinasub17** commented *Jun 11, 2021*

This is a follow up to https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1714.

After testing, I realized that the error message is super confusing when you run the command the old way without quoting:

```
ERRO[0007] invalid character 'e' looking for beginning of value
ERRO[0007] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1
```

This PR patches that to make it easier to follow and explain what is going on:

```
ERRO[0001] Could not determine underlying type of JSON string eu-west-1. This usually happens when the JSON string is malformed, or if the value is not properly quoted (e.g., "eu-west-1"). Underlying error: invalid character 'e' looking for beginning of value
ERRO[0001] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1
```

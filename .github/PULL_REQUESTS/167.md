# Update Terragrunt to support Terraform 0.9

**brikis98** commented *Apr 20, 2017*

This PR updates Terragrunt so it works with Terraform 0.9.x. This finally fixes #158.

Here’s the approach I used:

1. Instead of calling `terraform remote config` (which was removed in Terraform 0.9), we now call `terraform init` and pass `-backend-config` parameters as necessary.

1. I have removed support for DynamoDB locking, since this is now built into Terraform itself. To enable it, you just specify a `lock_table` attribute in your s3 backend configuration. I’ve updated Terragrunt to automatically create this table if it doesn’t exist already. If you want to Terraform to retry locks, you can use an `extra_arguments` block.

1. I’ve completely refactored the docs to emphasize that Terragrunt is now focused not on locking and remote state, but working with multiple modules and keeping your Terraform code DRY.

I’ve included a section in the README on how to migrate from the old Terragrunt and Terraform to this new version. Feedback is welcome!

It may be easier to browse the README directly in the branch: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/tree/terraform-0.9. You can find the migration instructions here: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/tree/terraform-0.9#migrating-from-terragrunt-v011x-and-terraform-08x-and-older.

How does this handle environment specific remote state files?  I imagine this would be best done using [state environments](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/environments.html) but I didn't notice it in the code.

What are you referring to with "this"?

I'm not sure this PR has any impact on remote state files... Can you give an example of what you mean?

I've reread the README, let me rewrite my initial question better!

Are you considering using the Terraform native support for [state environments](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/environments.html) or is it not needed due to how the remote statefile path is derived using `"${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"`?

I think Terraform's new state environments are a completely alternative way to manage multiple environments from what we describe in the Terragrunt README. The Terragrunt approach is to define all those environments in files on disk so that you can read the files, version them, revert them, etc. The state environments approach is to run a command to pick a different environment and perhaps to put conditional statements throughout your code so it behaves differently based on which environment was selected. I find the former approach easier to understand and less error prone, but AFAIK, nothing in Terragrunt or this PR prevents you from using the latter approach.

Thanks for the clarification.  I was slightly confused about the use case for the state environments as it seemed to conflict with your 'Golden Rules' of Terraform!  Good to hear your thoughts on it.

> One thought I had is that after reading everything, the reader still has to make one more leap on their own: What is the ideal, complete setup with Terragrunt that combines all these use cases? For that reason, it'd be nice if we had a _sample folder with maybe live and modules subfolders which mimicked a real setup and showed exactly what the root terraform.tfvars file and each "child" terraform.tfvars file looks like.

That's a *great* idea, but I think it's outside the scope of this PR. Could you file a separate bug to track this?

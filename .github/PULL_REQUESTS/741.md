# Fix concurrency issue with go-getter usage

**brikis98** commented *Jun 12, 2019*

When overriding the "file" getter in our `go-getter` usage, we were accidentally doing it in the globally-shared `getter.Getters` map. This is bad because (a) we're modifying a global variable and (b) since Terragrunt may make this change from many goroutines concurrently when you call `xxx-all` methods, this was occasionally causing a `fatal error: concurrent map writes` error.

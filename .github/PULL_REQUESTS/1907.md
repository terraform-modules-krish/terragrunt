# #1895 Updated tfr handling to support full paths

**denis256** commented *Nov 7, 2021*

Updated handling of TFR paths to concatenate strings and avoid using `path.Join()` which for URLs generate broken paths like:
```
path.Join("http://foo", "bar") => http:/foo/bar
```

Fix for: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1895

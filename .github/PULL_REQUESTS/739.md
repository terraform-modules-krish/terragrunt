# Switch from symlink and file copy to just file copy; upgrade dependencies; fix stack traces.

1. By default, `go-getter` uses symlinks for local files. This is fast and disk-space friendly, but it [doesn't seem to work on windows](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/733). Moreover, you can't copy anything into a symlinked folder, as it would end up copying it back into the original, so this caused issues for Terragrunt. As a workaround, I was letting `go-getter` create the symlink in one folder and then copying the files to another, but this was effectively the worst of both worlds‚Äîslow, not friendly to disk space, and complicated. In this PR, I've added by own `Getter` implementation that does file copying instead of using symlinks. I'm _hoping_ this fixes #733. It also allow us to copy existing symlinks without hitting infinite cycles, which I _think_ fixes #736. 
1. Update all our dependency versions. Turns out we had some really old dependencies in there, including a several-year-old version of `go-getter`.
1. Fix a bug where stack traces were being lost due to `MultiError` usage.

# Expose include config attributes

**yorinasub17** commented *Jun 14, 2021*

This is the first of several PRs for implementing the Imports RFC, as described in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1566

This PR is a minimal, backward compatible change that exposes included config attributes in the current config if the special `expose` attribute is toggled to `true`. When `expose` is set to `true`, users can reference the values from a parent included config using `include`, e.g. `include.locals.foo`.

Some caveats:
- In the interest of backward compatibility, the `expose` toggle defaults to `false` - in the future, once the full feature set is implemented, we can decide if we should default to `true` instead.
- Dependencies are not automatically fetched at the moment. This is a future feature (the ticket has been updated accordingly).
- Currently only one include block can exist per terragrunt config (this is why the include vars are available directly under `include` and not `include.LABEL`). This will change in the future.

# Reverse the dependency questions to match non-interactive behavior

**natefaerber** commented *Jun 30, 2018*

Since non-interactive answers "yes" to questions, we want the running of dependencies to depend on a "yes" answer instead of "no".

https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/471

I have run these test cases with `plan-all`:
* w/o --terragrunt-non-interactive: answer 'y' to all dependency questions
* w/o --terragrunt-non-interactive: answer 'n' to all dependency questions
* w/o --terragrunt-non-interactive: answer 'y' to first dependency question then 'n' to all others
* w/ --terragrunt-non-interactive

In all cases, dependencies were run or not-run as expected.

I had to [update a couple tests](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/commit/c0a0d72635d023ade569ae24cba12dd6a254f7a9), but now the build has passed. New release is here: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.15.0. New binaries should show up soon.

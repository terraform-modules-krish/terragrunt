@denis256 before updating docs, do you have a suggestion that is better than "groups-json" for the command name ?

> - [ ] Run the relevant tests successfully, including pre-commit checks.

The PR doesn't modify any code, though, I should probably add some tests ?

Hi,
since is related to reading output, I was thinking about something `output-xxx`

@smaftoul thank you for the PR! I am very excited to see it might be implemented soon 🤞 🙏

@CarterSheehan Hi ! Thanks for pinging, I stopped working on this because I have been fired (like a lot of startups are laying off) and took some holidays ...
I should definitely finish this feature, as it almost already works !

@smaftoul I like this feature a lot for cicd, but I am not clear exactly how it is intended to be used. When I run it, I just get the same module list as normal, except it is in json (which is useable, but takes a lot of additional work). What I was thinking would be most useful and applicable to cicd would be to run a command at the root that will automatically

1. get module groups
2. for Group1, run a `plan` for all modules and check if there are any changes
3. if there are changes, output a plan file and exit (ci tools can then post this for human review, which will then get ingested into an `apply`
4. if there are no changes to Group1, then move on to Group2

This nicely separates each dependency layer in your stack, and ensures that you have as much knowledge as possible about each deployment's consequences. No more having to fiddle around with "mock outputs", because modules only have a plan attempted when all previous-order modules have no pending changes.

Wish I could help, but I am still learning Go

Would love to see this @smaftoul ! I believe that this output can enable you to code what you are describing @phillip-constantine, but I don't think the whole process should be managed by Terragrunt.

I've added the documentation required :)

I've implemented a test close to the `TestTerragruntOutputFromDependency` test. WDYT ?

Looks like CI build is failing:
```
Stderr: # github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/cli
cli/cli_app.go:643:50: not enough arguments in call to configstack.FindStackInSubfolders
	have (*options.TerragruntOptions)
	want (*options.TerragruntOptions, *config.TerragruntConfig)
```

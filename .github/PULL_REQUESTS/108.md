# Add support for specifying the AWS profile to use in the config file

**Bowbaq** commented *Jan 24, 2017*

This adds support for specifying the AWS profile to use in the config file, in two places:
- Specifying an `aws_profile` in the `lock` config. This profile will be used by the SDK to provide credentials.
- Specifying a `profile` in the `config` section for the S3 backend. Terraform supports this, and terragrunt should as well.

I believe this addresses #48

Note: I tried to not introduce extraneous changes, but my editor is configured to run `goimport` on the files that I edit, and `goimport` seems to disagree with the formatting in this repo.

@jgartrel Does this solve the issues you brought up in #48? @allandrick What about yours?

@Bowbaq Should the profile be specified separately in the lock and remote state config, or should Terragrunt support a `provider` block where you configure the provider for everything that Terragrunt does?

```hcl
provider {
  backend = "aws" 
  config {
    profile = "foo"
  }
}
```

That way, if we use other remote state stores or other lock providers, we have a common mechanism to specify these sorts of details.

My vote would be to keep it simple for now.

The credentials needed for the remote state are not necessarily the same as the ones needed for the lock. Once other providers are supported, I could choose to store my state in Azure and my lock in AWS (for example). This would lead to two provider blocks.

Adding a provider block would also be a rather more involved amount of work, I think.

Big 👍 for this, solves #48 for me.

This would also really help our workflow. :+1: 

We also run multiple AWS accounts., one account per environment. Each time we switch environment, we currently have to export the AWS_PROFILE value to encure that Terragrunt speaks to the right account.

@smitthakkar96 Also please merge or rebase on master, which has the fix from #1980.

@rhoboat can you run the build. I also rebased and fix the pre-commit errors 
***

**rhoboat** commented *Jan 14, 2022*

Are you sure you rebased/merged with master? I'm kicking off a build with a version of this branch merged with master, so don't worry about it. If that build passes, we'll merge this up.

Thanks @smitthakkar96 for your contributions and for sticking this through!

No problem! Thanks for quick and detailed feedback and helping to merge `error_hooks` :)

I was interested in creating the RFC as we were discussing in the previous PR regarding lexical ordering of hooks. Can I go ahead?

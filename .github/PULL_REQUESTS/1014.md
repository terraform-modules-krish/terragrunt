I think that we can ignore this one.
"Use cases" under **Features** use `redirect_to` plugin. It builds the link using:
a) `url` from *_config.yml*
b) `baseurl` from *_config.yml*
c) `redirect_to` from *doc*

https://altalogy.github.io/terragrunt had the URL set to `https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/`. I changed it on a forked repo to use `altalogy.github.io`.It only affects the forked repo, so nothing has to be changed on `github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt`.

# Add support for STS duration option

**mantoine96** commented *May 12, 2021*

This PR adds the possibility to specify a specific STS Session duration when assuming a role via Terragrunt.

Resolves #495

Test output: https://gist.github.com/thehunt33r/895f31f880142e9587dd6afd5937dc7c

From what I gather on the tests, it's only GCP/GCS stuff which fails (due to me not having a GCP account), which I haven't touched

Hey @brikis98 , thanks again for your review. 

I've renamed the argument as agreed, as well as extracted the `3600` into a var.

Finally I've re-run the tests and updated the gist. 

Would you like me to clean up the history before we can consider merging?

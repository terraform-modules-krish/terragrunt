This PR adds a flag to **enable** the prepending of prefixes.

Also it may be reasonable to trim the prefix to be relative to a common parent of the modules or to cwd (or other place) - please guide me what is the suggested approach. In logs `prefix` key is an absolute path - I started from that.

Added tests for PrefixWriter for a complete picture. Somehow missed that initially.

Thanks! Where did this end up? Is the prefix the absolute path, or a relative path of some kind? I didn't see an example in the changed files...

Tested to find the answer myself, it is the absolute path...

Yeah, it's the absolute path:
```
[/home/sysop/code/github/dhirschfeld/azure-infra-test/terraform/dev/network]
```

That takes up a lot of screen real-estate. It would be great if the path could be relative to the `cwd` - i.e. running in the `dev` folder that would be:
```
[./network]
```

As a workaround you can utilize something like this 
terragrunt run-all plan -lock=false --terragrunt-non-interactive | sed "s#$(pwd)/##g"

# Include session configuration for aws helpers

**bwhaley** commented *May 22, 2020*

Fixes #1191.

In #978, we added a bucket policy giving the root user of an account access to the bucket. However, this introduced a bug in which certain credentials configurations would fail to create the policy because the session configuration was not included. 

This resolves the issue by passing the session configuration to the relevant functions. When not needed, an empty session configuration is passed.

> I feel like we have had at least a dozen issues/fixes around all the varieties of AWS auth. The changes look OK at first glance, but with all the permutations, I can't say for sure. Should we bite the bullet and add some sort tests for this? Although, with a root user, I'm not even sure what tests we could (safely) add?


To an extent this solves the issue, but the helper functions may still be broken since their sessions are still not initialized properly. The issue brings attention to the code structure of the remote state and helper functions. I think the sane option would be to add tests for this 100%, but at the same time I think we should be asking ourselves whether investing more time into the current code is worthwhile. Should we be planning a refactor instead?

# Graph representation of the terragrunt dependencies similar to terraform graph

**mauriciopoppe** commented *Apr 5, 2020*

Fixes https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1116

Implementation details:

- There's a new boolean param `--terragrunt-graph` that's only used in plan-all for now, when it's set the stack is printed in the graphviz language to stdout
- I created a new integration test that's a clone of `fixture-output-all`

## Usage

```sh
$ pwd
test/fixture-plan-all-graph/env1

$ terragrunt plan-all --terragrunt-graph | dot -Tjpg > graph.jpg
```

## Output

![graph](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1616682/78470355-b2553500-76dd-11ea-906d-72dae4960085.jpg)


## Pending items

- Path resolution to folders outside the working dir
- Display style for ignored modules
- Early exit in all the *-all commands
- More unit tests

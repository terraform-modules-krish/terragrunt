# fix: Adding terragrunt-log-level to cli help

**antmordel** commented *Feb 5, 2021*

I noticed the new added [terragrunt-log-level](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli-options/#terragrunt-log-level) wasn't specified in the CLI help.

This tiny change adds it :)

Have a great weekend.

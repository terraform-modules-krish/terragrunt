# Add regression test to confirm vars from env var in apply-all works

**yorinasub17** commented *Sep 21, 2020*

There was confusion from one of our users regarding whether or not setting tf vars via env vars works with `apply-all`, so I created a regression test for it. AFAIK, none of the existing tests tests this combination.

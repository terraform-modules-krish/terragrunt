# Add configurable retries

**andreykaipov** commented *Apr 2, 2021*

Addresses https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1630. Please lemme know what y'all think!

This PR adds two new options to configure our retries. For example, the following will try up to 10 times with 60 seconds in between each retry:

```hcl
retry_max_attempts = 10
retry_sleep_interval_sec = 60
retryable_errors = [
  "My own little error",
  "Another one of my errors",
]
```

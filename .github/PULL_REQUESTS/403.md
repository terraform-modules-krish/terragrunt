# Fix of issue #402: load given state file when specified.

**ColOfAbRiX** commented *Jan 17, 2018*

This is a bugfix for "Getting json.SyntaxError unexpected end of JSON input" Issue #402

When using a local backend and a path is given, terragrunt should load that file instead of looking in the default working directory.

As a Go beginner, feel free to suggest any correction or semantic mistake.

If the build passes, the new binaries should be here in a few minutes: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.13.25

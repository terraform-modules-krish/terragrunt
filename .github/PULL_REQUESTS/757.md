Unlike AWS, GCS automatically encrypts bucket contents. Should we provide a way to disable it? In addition, data is encrypted using a Google-managed key, but in the future, we could add the option to specify customer-managed encryption keys.

After speaking with @yorinasub17, we agreed to leave out the ability to disable encryption. Also, customer-managed keys can be implemented at a later date as needed by a specific customer.

I've added GCP configuration to the CircleCI env now and the tests pass.

@vincentdeity FYI - I've added support to Terragrunt for working with remote state using the GCS backend. It's pending review.

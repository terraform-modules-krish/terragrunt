## Description

Found that `findTflintConfigInProject()` function is not checking current directory for `tflint` configurations.
Tssue wasn't detected before since in tests were used `terraform` blocks with `source` field which during execution leads to copying of working directory to a temporary location from which `tflint` configuration lookup works by finding parent config file.

Included changes:
* added test case for failing case, with `terraform` block without `source` field
* updated `findTflintConfigInProject` to check current directory for tflint configuration and then lookup parent directories
* added tflint test for Windows CI

Fixes #2450.

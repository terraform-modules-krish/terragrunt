The goal of this PR is to resolve #674 to add the ability to call `show-all` to get a report of current state across all folders.

@brikis98 Let me take a stab at it . . .

@troylar, was a followup to this started?  I was looking at hacking together a script that did a similar thing using bash to find all output files matching a specified naming convention, and run a terraform show for automation purposes.  Before I did that, I wanted to make sure this wasn't something that was going to be implemented soon, since a native solution would probably be the better route.

Is there an update on this? I really could use a `show-all` command to combine with https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/infrastructure/#output-terraform-plan-information-into-a-merge-request

If anybody would like a quick n' dirty script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

create=0
update=0
delete=0

while read -d $'\0' file
do
  echo -e Processing $file
  cd $(dirname $file)

  alias convert_report=
  RESOURCES=$(terraform show --json plan.tfplan | jq -r '([.resource_changes[]?.change.actions?]|flatten)|{"create":(map(select(.=="create"))|length),"update":(map(select(.=="update"))|length),"delete":(map(select(.=="delete"))|length)}')

  (( create+=$(echo $RESOURCES | jq -r '.create') ))
  (( update+=$(echo $RESOURCES | jq -r '.update') ))
  (( delete+=$(echo $RESOURCES | jq -r '.delete') ))

  cd - >&-
done < <(find . -name "plan.tfplan" -print0)

echo \{\"create\": $create, \"update\": $update, \"delete\": $delete \} > tfplan.json

cat tfplan.json
```

It collects any `plan.tfplan` files, and produces one final `tfplan.json`.

# Detect cycles in dependency block parsing

**yorinasub17** commented *Sep 3, 2019*

This implements a friendlier error message instead of an infinite loop for the case described in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/844

Specifically, because `dependency` block output reading depends on `terragrunt output`, and because `terragrunt output` depends on parsing the config, you can end up in a situation where a simple `terragrunt plan` on a config that has a cyclic dependency would loop indefinitely trying to read `terragrunt output` across all the dependencies.

Merging this in. Thanks for the review!

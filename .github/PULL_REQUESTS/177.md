# Fix init command used to download remote configurations

**brikis98** commented *Apr 23, 2017*

This PR fixes #174 and #176. Weâ€™ve been using the `terraform init` command to download remote Terraform configurations for a while now. As of Terraform 0.9, this same command also tries to configure backends, download modules, etc. When updating Terragrunt to support Terraform 0.9, we forgot to update this original `init` call to pass `backend` parameters.

@josh-padnick I'm going to merge this in so I can submit a couple more fixes. Feedback welcome!

# Wait for shell when forwarding signals; shell package test coverage

**asobrien** commented *Feb 21, 2017*

This PR fixes #120.

The changes include:

* Modifying the `NewSignalsForwarder` so that the signal forwarder waits for the command to finish. It is possible that multiple signals need to be passed the command. Additionally, this fixes a bug where the signal forwarder previously panicked by passed the `*exec.Cmd`, instead of `os.Process`, to the signal forwarder since `os.Process` is only allocated after the command starts running.
* Adds test coverage for the `shell` package
* Creates a `GetExitCode` function, the exit code logic in `main.go` was migrated into the `shell` package so it could be tested.

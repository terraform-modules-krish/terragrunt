# Made sure external_id and session_name are respected when s3 backend needs assuming role

**kujon** commented *Feb 24, 2020*

Certain roles can be set up such that an additional `external_id` parameter is required, before assuming role can go ahead. Terraforms S3 backend [supports this functionality](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/s3.html#external_id). Terragrunt seems to ignore it.

Alternatively, maybe it would be good to replace the remote_state_s3.go with this https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/master/backend/remote-state/s3/backend.go?

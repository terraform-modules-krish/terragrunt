Thanks for your contribution! However, I think the go mod file was botched somehow because I am getting the following compile error when I checkout this PR:

```
# github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/test

Perhaps it's better to update the internal terraform version to latest, which is where we are getting the terraform defined helper functions from?

That's weird. The `go.mod` file didn't run for me even before updating `go-cty-yaml` so I think it's something on my part...

Would that fix it? Reading through https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23770, it looks like it was fixed in Terraform in v0.13, so I imagine the fix would have been included in Terragrunt by now.

We don't update the internal link with terraform frequently (since that only affects the included functions), and only opt to update it as needed (to conservatively avoid introducing too many backwards incompatibilities). So if you look at `go.mod`, you will see that we are linking in `v0.12.24`.

Ah I see! I tried updating it to the latest v0.15.5 but I'm getting even stranger module import errors regarding the `k8s.io/*` libraries. Even for v0.13.0 there's some funky `k8s.io/*` import errors. üò¨ I'm kind of worried what other implications that might have though.

I realized my mistake in the original commit though. I didn't realize y'all exclude the vendor directory so I shouldn't have tidied. Would you be okay with only a change to the underlying library?

That's fine! I just confirmed the updated go.mod works for me now, so we can move forward with this PR! I'll kick off the internal build, and if it passes, we can merge this in.

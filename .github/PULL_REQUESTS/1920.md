Thanks for the contribution!

However, I'm weary of this setting living on the `dependency` block, because that means you have to set it on every child module that depends on it. The desired solution is for `terragrunt` to use the right `terraform` binary when [terraform_binary](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#terraform_binary) is set on the dependency config (that is, `terraform_binary` is encoded in the `terragrunt.hcl` for `"../test-keypair"`). Does it work if you do that?

Hi @yorinasub17 

I tried to add `terraform_binary` in`terragrunt.hcl` of dependency `"../test-keypair"`, but got the same error.
```
[terragrunt] [/builds/ZvsktM4n/0/sandbox/us-east-1/iac/dev/ec2-test-keypair] 2021/11/25 12:00:55 Running command: /usr/local/bin/terraform/0.13.3/terraform output -json
Failed to load state: state snapshot was created by Terraform v1.0.6, which is newer than current v0.13.3; upgrade to Terraform v1.0.6 or greater to work with this state
```

it seems that in the execution of the `terraform output` command the `terragruntOptions` of the current `terragrunt.hcl` is used and not the one of the dependency `"../test-keypair"`

Ah then that is actually a bug, as the intended behavior is to honor the `terraform_binary` of the dependency `terragrunt.hcl`. I'll investigate to see if I can get that fixed.

# Added support for gcs impersonate_service_account option available in terraform 0.14rc1

**ksvladimir** commented *Nov 20, 2020*

We just started using terragrunt and love the tool, thanks for building it!

Our environment relies on the [impersonate_service_account](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/master/website/docs/backends/types/gcs.html.md#configuration-variables) option of the gcs state backend. It's available in terraform 0.14rc1, so terragrunt will soon need to support it. This PR adds this support.

With `bucket_sse_algorithm=aws:kms` access logs aren't populated and no warnings or notifications appear in logs or in AWS console...
Once is set `bucket_sse_algorithm = "AES256"` - after a while logs are poduced

Added validation of `bucket_sse_algorithm` if `accesslogging_bucket_name` is defined, if the configuration is invalid it will throw an error

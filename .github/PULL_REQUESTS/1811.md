# #1499 Added logic to skip outputs verification in case of module initialization

**denis256** commented *Sep 16, 2021*

Added logic to skip outputs verification in case of module initialization, if the dependency fail to generate outputs it is handled as error code from terraform invocation

Example: https://github.com/denis256/terragrunt-test-1499

Before this change:
```
$ terragrunt run-all init

ERRO[0011] Module /work/app has finished with an error: /work/module1/terragrunt.hcl is a dependency of /work/app/terragrunt.hcl but detected no outputs. Either the target module has not been applied yet, or the module has no outputs. If this is expected, set the skip_outputs flag to true on the dependency block.  prefix=[/work/app] 
ERRO[0011] 1 error occurred:
        * /work/module1/terragrunt.hcl is a dependency of /work/app/terragrunt.hcl but detected no outputs. Either the target module has not been applied yet, or the module has no outputs. If this is expected, set the skip_outputs flag to true on the dependency block.
 
ERRO[0011] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1 
```

After this change:
```
$ terragrunt run-all init
...
Terraform has been successfully initialized!
...
$ terragrunt run-all apply
Apply complete!
```

Thanks for the PR! The code LGTM and I tested and verified that it fixes the bug. I'll kick the tests off.

Looks like `terraform fmt` needs to be run on the newly added fixture files. Everything else looks good!

Updated formatting for test fixture, wondering if this can be somehow verified locally

Excellent, thanks! Re-running the tests now.

You can run `pre-commit` locally to verify, e.g. `pre-commit run --all-files`.

# Add a fallback param to find_in_parent_folders

**brikis98** commented *Oct 17, 2017*

This is a follow-up to #320. A use case we’re likely to see frequently with `find_in_parent_folders(xxx)` is to use it in combination with `extra_arguments`. The catch is that you’d want to specify the `extra_arguments` block once and have it apply to all modules, even if not all the modules have an `xxx` file in a parent folder, but as it is now, `find_in_parent_folders` exits with an error if it can’t find the file. With this PR, you can specify a second param that is a fallback value to return if the file cannot be found: `find_in_parent_folders("foo.tfvars", "some-fallback.tfvars")`.

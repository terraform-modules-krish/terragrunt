# Support Existing Buckets for the GCS backend

**robmorgan** commented *Jul 2, 2019*

Ensure `project` and `location` are optional when using the GCS backend. This allows users to use Terragrunt with an existing GCS bucket they may have already created.

This PR also fixes a bug that may lead to Terragrunt creating a GCS bucket in the wrong location.

# Hclfmt specific file

**EDsCODE** commented *Mar 26, 2020*

Implements #1091 as @yorinasub17 suggested!
 
I added cli functionality for when hclfmt command is run if the `--terragrunt-hclfmt-file` is present with a specified file (e.g. `terragrunt hclfmt --terragrunt-hclfmt-file /path/to/terragrunt.hcl`)

Gist result of the two new tests hclfmtfile and hclfmtfileerrors [here](https://gist.github.com/EDsCODE/76e88fce4ad92f4dd76b299d6dbcef3c)

**Edit:** I didn't put up an RFC for this as I added the option in a pretty similar fashion as the other options. But as a short descriptor: if hclfmt is run with the option and a specific file is provided the `runhclfmt` command will only match and add the specific file to the array of files to process rather than the entire tree. If the option is not provided, then the entire tree of subdirectories will be added as previously implemented.

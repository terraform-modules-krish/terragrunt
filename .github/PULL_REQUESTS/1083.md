# Fix source of panic

**yorinasub17** commented *Mar 7, 2020*

This fixes the cause of the panic in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1079, where a catastrophic exit from `terraform` causes the shell command to return the error without output, but `runTerraformWithRetry` was expecting an output always.

# Commercial support bug fixes

**brikis98** commented *Nov 2, 2020*

1. Fix the features that are included with pro support. 
1. Capitalize the word "Grunt."
1. Fix typo in "prodduction-grade" (lol).
1. Strengthen the CTA at the bottom of the page.
1. Add link from the README to the commercial support page.
1. Remove `jekyll build` command from start script as it's redundant with the `jekyll serve` that's already there.

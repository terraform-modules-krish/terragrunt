Hi @yorinasub17 no worries about the time to review! I don't expect much in December ðŸ˜„ 

I've pushed updated docs, let me know if that does the job. Another thought on `MustWalkTerraformOutput`, I only needed it for my tests, i wouldn't be surprised if it panics on some cases, would you prefer it to be moved into the test folder instead of `reflect.go` so people don't rely on it?

cheers

Looks like one of the tests failed with the following error:

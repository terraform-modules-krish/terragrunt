Thanks for the PR @robinbowes! It looks good to me, but you'll probably also want to update the [test](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/1b0cb787c0314681e92f5ff083486eb5a988452f/test/integration_test.go#L523) as well

Good spot. How's that look? If it wasn't 02:30 here I'd think about setting up a local go env and running the tests :)

@robinbowes Any update on this?

I'm afraid I've not had time to re-visit yet.

OK, I just opened #309 with the full fix, which also allows me to run tests in the PR. Closing this one now. Thanks!

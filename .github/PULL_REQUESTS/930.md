# Revert change introduced in #866

**yorinasub17** commented *Oct 29, 2019*

This reverts #866 in favor of resolving the issues reported in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/906 and https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/904. These two issues are caused by concurrent calls to terragrunt to update the source OR run `init` in the same working folder, caused by concurrent calls to `terragrunt output` due to dependency ordering.

The proper fix that will allow us to reimplement this are:

- Introduce locking mechanism to prevent concurrent calls to `terragrunt output` in the same module.
- Introduce a graph logic that will extract the outputs, once, prior to calling the steps in a `xxx-all`.

Both are non-trivial solutions that introduce a lot of complexity. I have decided that it will take enough time to implement that it seems better to revert the fix as suggested in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/906#issuecomment-547482455.

Hmm now that you mention it, yes we can probably resolve this right there in the output call. Originally I was thinking we would need some fixes in the `xxx-all` calls, but it is probably good enough to mutex the output call. Let me try that.

Closing in favor of https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/937. We can revive this if that does not resolve the issue.

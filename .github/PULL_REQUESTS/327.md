# Don't silently swallow errors during xxx-all methods

**brikis98** commented *Oct 22, 2017*

This PR fixes a bug where the `xxx-all` methods (e.g., `apply-all`, `plan-all`) would silently swallow errors found while parsing `terraform.tfvars` files. For example, if you had a syntax error in one of your `terraform.tfvars` files, the `apply-all` method would simply skip that entire module, rather than telling you there is a problem.

Also, to make it easier to spot this sort of thing, the `xxx-all` methods will now print out the modules that were found in alphabetical order.

# Handle empty args for get_terraform_cli_args function

**camlow325** commented *Jun 8, 2020*

Closes #1214

When the `get_terraform_cli_args()` function is called and the list of CLI args is empty, the function previously caused Terragrunt to crash. With the change in this MR, the function would now just return an empty list to the caller when the list of CLI args is empty.

Thanks for the review and comments, @yorinasub17. I added a unit test for the fix. Locally, the new test fails with the "must not call ListVal with empty" error without the fix and passes with the fix. Please let me know if you see anything else that you would like for me to update for this. Thanks again!

# GH-1147: do not add -var or -var-file extra_arguments during "destroy" if plan is provided

**FineWolf** commented *Apr 21, 2020*

Fixes #1147 

The script now checks if the command in question is destroy and if the second argument is a file. If so, -var and -var-file appends are skipped.

Tests have been updated.

# hclfmt should run before parsing the terragrunt config

The formatting tool should not be concerned with decoding the terragrunt config, and should only deal with HCL2 syntax errors.

Any chance to see this merged ?

@yorinasub17 Is this waiting on anything? Test failure?

Yes there is a deterministic failure where the test stalls and times out. I haven't had a chance to dig in given that I couldn't repro it locally.

Ok I don't know why the build was failing before, but it is passing after a rebase so going to merge and release this now.

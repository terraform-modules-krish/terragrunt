# Update remote state docs to recommend generate first

**yorinasub17** commented *May 13, 2022*

The comment in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/2104 made me realize that our remote state documentation is a bit misleading. We default to recommending the `remote_state` block for setting up your remote state configuration, but in reality, that may not be the best option for all use cases.

For example, one could use `generate` blocks instead to manage the backend config, which works well just like `remote_state`; the main difference being that `terragrunt` does not try to manage the remote state objects when using `generate`, whereas the design of `remote_state` blocks is to have `terragrunt` manage your state buckets.

For this reason, this PR proposes to revamp the remote state docs to instead recommend:

- Using `generate` blocks to generate a `terraform` block containing the `backend` subblock.
- Recommend using `remote_state` block if users want to additionally have `terragrunt` manage the state resources, like automatically creating and updating them.

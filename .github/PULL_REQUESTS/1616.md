# feat: add built-in function to `get_aws_account_alias`

**jones2026** commented *Mar 28, 2021*

This is the PR for issue #1615 to add support for looking up the current account alias for AWS. I did not see any other unit tests for the other AWS built-in functions, but would be glad to figure out how to add some in for this if that would help.

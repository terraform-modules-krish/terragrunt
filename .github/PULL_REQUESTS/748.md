# Add terraform functions to terragrunt eval context

**apottere** commented *Jun 14, 2019*

This PR allows you to use all of the [built-in terraform functions](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/functions.html) in terragrunt files.

I'm not sure how to use `dep`, so if I messed up the `Gopkg.*` files let me know and I can revert that commit.

I didn't realize until writing the docs that this + hcl2 means you can use functions outside of a string interpolation, which is super cool.
```hcl
    key    = format("%s/terraform.tfstate", path_relative_to_include())
```

# Fluxcd controller for terragrunt

**mcortinas** commented *Oct 13, 2022*

Hello,

 I used some Terragrunt two times in a different projects amb I'm very happy due to DRY filoshophy.
 For ther hand, we're working moving Terraform code inside FluxCD with this controller https://github.com/weaveworks/tf-controller 
 I think could be a good idea if there was the same at Terragrunt level, i mean a fluxcd controller for terragrunt codes.

PD: I should preferred comment via slack or some chat message service but I don't found , apologies for sharing ideas as a github issues...

In case @mcortinas or anyone else is interested there is prior art for the DRY pattern with TF-controller here - https://github.com/phoban01/flux-terragrunt-poc. It might be interesting to also consider something where terragrunt  and TF-controller OCI could work together to provide separation of concerns around configuration and instruction

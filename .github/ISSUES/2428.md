# Terragrunt only accepts a path to service account key file in remote_state.config.credentials for GCS

**stilljake** commented *Jan 23, 2023*

Terraform allows the credentials attribute for a gcs backend to be either the path to **OR** the contents of a service account key in JSON format. However, when trying to use the JSON contents of a key file in the terragrunt remote_state block there is an error:

```
ERRO[0000] dialing: cannot read credentials file: open {
}: file name too long 
ERRO[0000] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1 
```

The other method of supplying credentials via `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` also seems to only accepts a file path. Where as with terraform we can use the JSON file contents to set `GOOGLE_BACKEND_CREDENTIALS`.

It would be nice to have the option to use the file contents directly the same as with terraform. In our environment we can easily pass in the JSON as secrets to our CI/CD pipelines but baking in the files adds extra complexity

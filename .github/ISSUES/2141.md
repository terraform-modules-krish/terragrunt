# [Question] How do I handle the following fields in the golang code?

**guodongq** commented *Jun 13, 2022*

I would like to generate the following file.

```
locals {
  region_vars = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("region.hcl"))
  region      = local.region_vars.locals.region

  project        = "abc-dev"
  account_number = "443813933915"
  services = [
    "apiserver",
  ]
  additional_statements = [
    {
      "Sid" : "",
      "Effect" : "Allow",
      "Action" : [
        "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
        "kms:Decrypt"
      ],
      "Resource" : [
        "arn:aws:secretsmanager:${local.region}:${local.account_number}:secret:*",
        "arn:aws:kms:${local.region}:${local.account_number}:key/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

But in my golang code, I can define a structure as following
```
type ProjectHcl struct {
	Locals Locals `hcl:"locals,block"`
}

type Locals struct {
	Project       string   `hcl:"project"`
	AccountNumber string   `hcl:"account_number"`
	Services      []string `hcl:"services"`
}
```

How can I deal with other fields  `region_vars`, `region`, `additional_statements`?

# Is there a way to destroy resources when I delete a folder

**marko-roman** commented *Jun 9, 2022*

For example i have applayed follow structure
|_envs
|__prod
|__dev

And I want to delete `dev`. I need firth run `terragrunt run-all destroy` inside `dev` folder, and after that delete folder and push to git.
But i want to use CI/CD and destroy resources when i delete `dev` folder.

Are there any way how to detect that folder was deleting when i run `terragrunt run-all apply` or `plan`?

Hi,
afaik this is not supported, it will require to remember commit of "last run" calculate diff, identify what is removed and run destroy

Hi,
I was wondering if there is a way to run a `terragrunt run-all plan -destroy` in case of terragrunt file deletion.

Any opinions ? @denis256 ?

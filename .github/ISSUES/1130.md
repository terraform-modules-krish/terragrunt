# Released build is not compatible with cross-platforms

We are trying to install `terragrunt` on linux machine but looks like build is not compatible for cross platform.
```

```

Also, On mac I tried using the binary but looks like it's failing.
Need to fix go build.

If you look at the error message, you will see that the file you downloaded is HTML, which means `wget` didn't follow the links properly to the S3 URL returned by github where the actual binary asset lives. Note how there is a URL embedded there where the actual binary lives.

Apologies, binary wasn't downloaded properly. 
Closing issue.

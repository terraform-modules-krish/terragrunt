# Msys2 shell hook script causes Windows Powershell/Cmd console output colours to be displayed as escape sequences

**Tzrlk** commented *Apr 27, 2022*

Similar issue as #614 and #1854. Coloured console output for Terragrunt displays as the literal colour escape sequences, rather than the colours themselves.
* Consoles tested are Cmd, Powershell 5, Powershell 7.
* Msys2 is 20220128.0.0 and version hasn't changed since before upgrade.

Situation:
* Upgraded Terragrunt to v0.36.7
* Installed Windows 10 updates
* Restarted computer

Results (Apologies for the extreme redaction):
![terragrunt-plan-0 36 7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/169667/165417334-c18d8f34-fdd5-4c79-a189-77f683f846fb.png)

Appears to be something to do with the shell hook script that runs before the job:
```hcl
terraform {
	# ...
	before_hook "AwsAuthCheck" {
		commands = [
			"plan",
			"apply",
			"refresh",
			"destroy",
		]
		execute  = [ "sh", "${get_repo_root()}/bin/ensure-auth.sh" ]
	}
	# ...
}
```
* Changing execute to `[ "sh", "-c", "echo 'hello'" ]` has the same effect.
* Issue occurs even if the script file contains _nothing_ but `aws sts get-caller-identity`
* Changing the hook command to `[ "aws", "sts", "get-caller-identity" ]` displays correct output.
* Wrapping `sh` command with powershell also works: `[ "pwsh", "-Command", "sh ${get_repo_root()}/bin/ensure-auth.sh" ]`
* Executing terragrunt in the msys2 shell directly outputs three "failed to get console mode: The handle is invalid." error log messages, but otherwise displays correctly.

Without looking at the code, I'd suspect the issue is something to do with the console mode defaulting to v1 when `sh` runs. Once the command is done, the value doesn't reset, and the rest of the output displays without the needed v2 ANSI code processing.

What's happening is that the `bash.exe` from msys2 seems to be un-setting `ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_PROCESSING` (see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/setconsolemode#parameters) on stdout, presumably because it wants to handle those itself when launching subprograms?

Terragrunt could reset the console mode after running one such hook, I presume.

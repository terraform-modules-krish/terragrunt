# backend config overwrite

**grimm26** commented *Apr 26, 2017*

terragrunt keeps asking me about overwriting the backend config.  It seems like things are just ordered differently?

```
% terragrunt plan
[terragrunt] [/Users/git/aws/terraforms/production/prod/data-storage] 2017/04/25 20:49:06 Running command: terraform --version
[terragrunt] 2017/04/25 20:49:07 Reading Terragrunt config file at /Users/git/aws/terraforms/production/prod/data-storage/terraform.tfvars
[terragrunt]  WARNING: Terraform remote state is already configured for backend s3 with config map[bucket:enova-tfstate.us-east-2 encrypt:true key:prod/data-storage/terraform.tfstate lock_table:terragrunt_locks region:us-east-2], but your Terragrunt configuration specifies config map[encrypt:true bucket:enova-tfstate.us-east-2 key:prod/data-storage/terraform.tfstate region:us-east-2 lock_table:terragrunt_locks]. Overwrite? (y/n) 
```

We've been issuing a number of releases lately, so I'm thinking this is a duplicate of #188. Could you try the latest version of Terragrunt and see if that fixes your issue?

I upgraded from 0.12.8 to 0.12.11 this morning and the problem seems to have been remediated.

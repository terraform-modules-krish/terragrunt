# $AWS_PROFILE/$AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE env vars not being honored

As per issue #21 

@brikis98 looks like I'm still having this issue.

```
[karl.barbour@xxx tf_poc]$ terragrunt apply
[terragrunt] 2016/12/21 15:04:13 Reading Terragrunt config file at .terragrunt
[terragrunt] 2016/12/21 15:04:13 Initializing remote state for the s3 backend
[terragrunt] 2016/12/21 15:04:13 Error finding AWS credentials (did you set the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables?): NoCredentialProviders: no valid providers in chain. Deprecated. 
	For verbose messaging see aws.Config.CredentialsChainVerboseErrors
[karl.barbour@xxx tf_poc]$ echo $AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE 
poc-account
[karl.barbour@xxx tf_poc]$ echo $AWS_PROFILE 
poc-account
```

As you can see, the env vars are working. 

Versions:
terragrunt `0.7.1`
aws-cli `1.10.47`
Darwin `15.5.0`

Any ideas?

With these ENV vars set, I can use the CLI fine (i.e. `aws ec2 describe-instances`), so it doesn't appear to be a credential issue.

Out of curiosity, what happens if you run `terraform plan` directly with the exact same env vars and profile?

@brikis98 yes, it worked fine at the time (apologies - I should have mentioned).

This may be environmental (to me) as I have now managed to make it work by creating a completely new OS X profile. I'll mark this as closed again but if anybody else sees the issue in future please do raise a new issue. 

For reference, https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/index.html mentions the following:

> Shared Credentials file
> 
> You can use an AWS credentials file to specify your credentials. The default location is $HOME/.aws/credentials on Linux and OS X, or "%USERPROFILE%\.aws\credentials" for Windows users. If we fail to detect credentials inline, or in the environment, Terraform will check this location. You can optionally specify a different location in the configuration by providing the shared_credentials_file attribute, or in the environment with the AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE variable. This method also supports a profile configuration and matching AWS_PROFILE environment variable:
> 
> Usage:
> 
> provider "aws" {
>   region                   = "us-west-2"
>   shared_credentials_file  = "/Users/tf_user/.aws/creds"
>   profile                  = "customprofile"
> }

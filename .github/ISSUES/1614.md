# --terragrunt-include-dir doesn't work with relative paths

**queglay** commented *Mar 27, 2021*

I'm finding some odd behaviour with --terragrunt-include-dir.  First it doesn't seem to think more than one sub dir should be included in this example:

```
admin:~/environment/firehawk (firehawk-init-folder) $ terragrunt run-all apply --terragrunt-include-dir /home/ec2-user/environment/firehawk/firehawk-init/modules/**

Are you sure you want to run 'terragrunt apply' in each folder of the stack described above? (y/n) n
```

More importantly I also find that a relative path doesn't work at all.

I have tried other variants of the above commands with and without wildcards.

The version is:
```
admin:~/environment/firehawk (firehawk-init-folder) $ terragrunt --version
terragrunt version v0.28.15
```

I'm not sure I follow. What behavior are you expecting for each of those? What does your folder structure look like?
***

**queglay** commented *Apr 2, 2021*

The folder structure is as the log shows above.

For example I am running from ~/environment/firehawk.
Directly in there would be one example folder:
```
firehawk-init/modules/private-tls-cert 
```

I was expecting `terragrunt run-all apply --terragrunt-include-dir ./firehawk-init`
to include that folder above but it doesn't.
***

**queglay** commented *Apr 2, 2021*

Sorry I realised that was an ambiguous example - it wasn't excluded in the first example, but only in the second.
But the next line was always excluded:
```
Module /home/ec2-user/environment/firehawk/firehawk-init/modules/terraform-aws-iam-profile-packer (excluded: true, dependencies: [])
```
That also is contained in the same dir `firehawk-init`, but it is excluded and I dont think it should be.

I'm also seeing similar behaviour.

> I'm not sure I follow. What behavior are you expecting for each of those? What does your folder structure look like?

While I can't necessarily answer _for_ the original poster, I can tell you what I would expect based on what they supplied:

```
terragrunt run-all apply --terragrunt-include-dir /home/ec2-user/environment/firehawk/firehawk-init/modules/**
```
I would expect these two entries, which are the second and third line down in their module output to be `excluded: false` because it is contained within the `firehawk-init/modules` directory and should be glob-matched by the `**`
```
=> Module /home/ec2-user/environment/firehawk/firehawk-init/modules/private-tls-cert (excluded: false, dependencies: [])
=> Module /home/ec2-user/environment/firehawk/firehawk-init/modules/terraform-aws-iam-profile-packer (excluded: true, dependencies: [])
```
* They are both within the directory supplied as the `include-dir`.
* They are both only one level deep (so should match with both `*` and `**`). 
* And crucially, they are direct siblings to each other, so they should either _both_ be `excluded: false`, or _neither_. I can't see any reason for being treated differently

Digital Ocean's interactive glob checker also says they [both match](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tools/glob?comments=true&glob=%2Fhome%2Fec2-user%2Fenvironment%2Ffirehawk%2Ffirehawk-init%2Fmodules%2F%2A%2A&matches=false&tests=%2Fhome%2Fec2-user%2Fenvironment%2Ffirehawk%2Ffirehawk-init%2Fmodules%2Fprivate-tls-cert&tests=%2Fhome%2Fec2-user%2Fenvironment%2Ffirehawk%2Ffirehawk-init%2Fmodules%2Fterraform-aws-iam-profile-packer).

Are you sure you want to run 'terragrunt apply' in each folder of the stack described above? (y/n)
```
I have highlighted three lines with a `*` prefix; these are entries which I believe should be included based on my current working directory and the `include-dir` glob I provided. Again, in this case there are some folders which are siblings of either other in my directory hierarchy, but some are included and some are excluded, and I don't see a reason (or a fix) for this.

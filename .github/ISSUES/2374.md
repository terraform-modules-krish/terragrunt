# before_hook on destroy action

**den-is** commented *Nov 28, 2022*

I'm trying to add before_hook with cleanup steps not related to terraform before the deletion of an AWS resource.

I'm curious if there is a way to determine if what "action" terragrunt is executing to run command in the before_hook.

Any variable and flag that can be passed to before_hook context for building if_else logic?

damn... wrote issue too fast.. sorry
 there is a `commands` argument to terragrunt hooks:

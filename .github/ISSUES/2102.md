HI,

I have already tried --terragrunt-log-level debug, there are so much outputs, but I can't see any hint according to the mentioned error message! :)


Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

Hi, 
"Running command:" logs should say where terraform is invoked,
like "Running command: terraform plan prefix=[/home/mqiu/terragrunt_deployment/dev/west-europe/dev/ehyp/platform/database/postgresql/flexible_server/pgdb_flex_server]"

Is module `terraform-provider-vault` used? was tried to define `VAULT_ADDR` env variable?

Hi,

I really don't know, what is exactly going wrong, but I copied the pgdb_flex_server to pgdb_flex_panda, and I can deploy again.

Regards!

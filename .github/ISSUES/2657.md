# Terragrunt fmt fails when common files contain includes

**TaxBusby** commented *Aug 8, 2023*

**Describe the bug**
Issue is similar to #824 but for the builtin `terragrunt fmt` command. Terragrunt is trying to parse some files as modules that should only be used as includes in other modules, and the command fails.

When I run `terragrunt fmt -recursive -check` on the root of my repo, I get:

```
ERRO[0000] Error: Error in function call
      
ERRO[0000]   on /path/to/repo/terragrunt.hcl line 15, in locals: 
ERRO[0000]   15:   environment_vars = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("env.hcl")) 
ERRO[0000]                                              
ERRO[0000] Call to function "find_in_parent_folders" failed: ParentFileNotFound: Could not find a env.hcl in any of the parent folders of /path/to/repo/terragrunt.hcl. Cause: Traversed all the way to the root..
```

I have a repo structure like the following:

```
├── root
├── account-1
│   ├── region-1
│   │   └── terragrunt.hcl
│   ├── region-2
│   │   └── terragrunt.hcl
|   └── env.hcl
└── terragrunt.hcl
```
And my root `terragrunt.hcl` contains:
```hcl
locals {
  # Automatically load environment-level variables
  environment_vars = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("env.hcl"))
}
```
in order to load some common config files 


**Expected behavior**
Terragrunt format should avoid parsing these includes, or provide a workaround to skip a folder or file with includes.


**Versions**
- Terragrunt version: Tested 0.36.6 and 0.48.6
- Terraform version: 1.2.2
- Environment details (Ubuntu 20.04, Windows 10, etc.): MacOS + Linux

**Additional context**
I'm not super familiar with terragrunt structures. If there's a workaround in how I author this root `terragrunt.hcl` I'd be happy to apply it, or some way I can get the format command to ignore this root folder. `hclfmt` works fine and has no issue parsing any of these files.

We're having this problem too!

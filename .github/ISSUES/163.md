# Confusing Error Message when terraform.source property points to an invalid location.

**josh-padnick** commented *Apr 12, 2017*

My `terraform.tfvars` file looked like this:

```
terragrunt = {
  # Terragrunt will copy the Terraform configurations specified by the source parameter, along with any files in the
  # working directory, into a temporary folder, and execute your Terraform commands in that folder.
  terraform {
    source = "git::git@github.com:Acme/infrastructure-modules.git//iam-cross-account?ref=v0.0.1"
  }

  # Include all settings from the root terraform.tfvars file
  include = {
    path = "${find_in_parent_folders()}"
  }
}
```

But when I ran `terragrunt apply` I got a confusing error message:

```

The issue turned out to be that the `terragrunt.terraform.source` property pointed to an invalid location. That is, the git repo didn't have the folder location specified. 

So this GitHub issue is really to report two separate things:

1. When this happens we should have a much friendlier error message.
1. Tmp folder paths are so longer that it makes logs hard to read. It'd be better if we had logs that looked more like this:

   ```

Ah, I hit this once before too. Should definitely be fixed.

We use `terraform init` to do the downloading. I wonder why it doesn't exit with an error for an invalid path.

This is fairly specific to OS X, which has an odd tmp folder. On other OS's it's `/tmp`...

FYI, the macOS `/tmp` is a symlink to `/private/tmp/`.

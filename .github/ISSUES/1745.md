# Feature request - provider generators

**PertsevRoman** commented *Jul 9, 2021*

Current terragrunt version doesn't support functions for generation any kind of typical content (except backend), so current generator requires `<<EOF` syntax usage for contents field.
```hcl
generate "provider" {
  path      = "provider.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite"
  contents = <<EOF
  provider "aws" {
    region              = "us-east-1"
    version             = "= 2.3.1"
    allowed_account_ids = ["1234567890"]
  }
EOF
}
```
I'd suggest to use following syntax (which is cleaner than use Bash-like constructions)
```hcl
generate "test-provider" {
  path = "test-provider.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"

  contents = make_aws_provider({
    region = "us-east-1"
    profile = "test-profile"
  })
}
```

I was thinking about something like this in the context of our particular situation (multiple accounts + multiple regions + specific provider aliases for some overly complex modules) and a potential syntax like this could work:

```
provider "aws_cloudfront" {
  type = "aws"
  alias = "cloudfront"
  config = {
    region = "us-east-1"
    profile = "a"
  }
  generate = {
    path = "provider_aws_cloudfront.tf"
    if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  }
}
```

which generates `provider_aws_cloudfront.tf`:
```
provider "aws" {
  alias   = "cloudfront"
  region  = "us-east-1"
  profile = "a"
}
```

This doesn't quite match the current architecture of passing things on the commandline, but we're already specifically generating files and passing things that way, e.g. the `generate` option on the `remote_state` block, so it's not that far off.

Actual hierarchical provider stuff, e.g. having a base provider which specifies the access key parameters which is then overridden with the specific bits needed for this module, would be implemented by the import RFC: https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/rfc/imports/

An enhancement for this could be adding a block that generates the `terraform` and `required_providers` blocks based on the provider blocks present + any overrides specified in that block.

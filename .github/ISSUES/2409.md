# Can terragrunt destroy be executed without the interactive prompt saying no?

As part of CI/CD automation, I need to set destroy option to prompt no to exit with 0. Is this possible?

Hi,
AFAIK can be disabled destroy by setting `prevent_destroy = true` on `terraform` block which will prevent destroy but the exit code each time will be different from 0.

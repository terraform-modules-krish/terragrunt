# download_dir is not respected with read_terragrunt_config with a file in parent folder

**nicolasnoel** commented *Oct 26, 2020*

I have a configuration where `download_dir` is used to 'build' the project aside of my sources:
```
download_dir = "${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/../build/.terragrunt-cache/${path_relative_to_include()}"
```

This works fine, however, when I use `read_terragrunt_config()` with a file that contains a dependency block _and_ that file is in a parent folder, then the download dir for the dependency is in the current folder, instead or the download_dir folder.
If the _read_terragrunt_config_ file is in the same directory, the download_dir folder is correctly used.

for example:
```
terragrunt.hcl (contains download_dir)
└── module
    ├── common.hcl (contains dependency)
    └── submodule
        └── terragrunt.hcl (contains read_terragrunt_config(../common.hcl)
```
This doesn't work as expected and will create a `.terragrunt-cache` folder in the submodule folder.

Instead,
```
terragrunt.hcl (contains download_dir)
└── module
    └── submodule
        ├── common.hcl (contains dependency)
        └── terragrunt.hcl (contains read_terragrunt_config(common.hcl)
```
This works as expected, the `.terragrunt-cache` folder will be created at the `download_dir` location.

but it requires to copy the common.hcl file inside the submodule folder. When having a lot of submodules, it would be nice if the common.hcl could be unique and shared with all the submodules.

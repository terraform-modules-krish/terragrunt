# Custom IAM and STS endpoint support for `terragrunt --terragrunt-iam-role` commands

**marshall7m** commented *Sep 16, 2022*

I've looked at the Terragrunt "Work with multiple AWS accounts" [docs](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/work-with-multiple-aws-accounts/) but could not find any reference to flags or env vars that can be set in order for terragrunt to retrieve AWS credentials from a custom endpoint. My specific use case is for local testing terragrunt commands that need to assume an IAM role that is simulated locally. Internally this means changing AWS `sts assume-role` API requests to incorporate an endpoint URL parameter (e.g. in the AWS CLI form it would be something like `aws sts assume-role --endpoint-url=${CUSTOM} ...`)

Maybe env vars along the lines of `TERRAGRUNT_IAM_ROLE_ENDPOINT_URL` and `TERRAGRUNT_STS_ROLE_ENDPOINT_URL`

Hi,
endpoints used by Terragrunt can be configured for S3 and Dynamodb, for remote state block  through keys, which chan be configured to load env variables:

```
endpoint
dynamodb_endpoint
```

If is required to pass custom endpoint to invoked Terraform - it should be implemented in provider definition in HCL files, or generated through `generate` block

Hi @denis256, thank you for your quick response. My question is in regards to an endpoint for Terragrunt to 
 use for assuming roles before invoking Terraform. Specifically, I'm referring to passing a custom endpoint URL to the STS client created within the aws_helper/config.go file's `AssumeIamRole` function.

Hi,
I think it should be implemented in code, not sure if you can pass a custom endpoint through `AWS_STS_REGIONAL_ENDPOINTS / AWS_S3_US_EAST_1_REGIONAL_ENDPOINT` env variables

I did a keyword search for those env vars but couldn't find any matches within the Terragrunt repo. Unless those env vars are implicitly inherited within the AWS SDK clients?

I don't use Go at all but with the little research I've done, it looks like the master branch's aws_helper/config.go file's `AssumeIamRole` function's `sess.Config` attribute isn't passed an `aws.Config` object with any `EndpointResolver` configuration that specifies an `URL` to point to a custom endpoint.

# `terragrunt show -json` ERRs on Terraform outputs something to stderr

I have an existing state (tf v0.13.7) and want to call `terragrunt show -json`

```
$ terragrunt show -json
Failed to marshal state to json: unsupported attribute "ena_support"
ERRO[0009] Hit multiple errors:
Hit multiple errors:
exit status 1
```

The actual error on the Terraform side seems to be, that the state contains some AMI attribute, that the client does not understand. But this more like a warning message that appears on `stderr`. When I call it without the json parameter I still get the message `unsupported attribute "ena_support"`, but the output is shown as expected.

```
$ terragrunt show | head -3
unsupported attribute "ena_support"
# aws_instance.bastion[0]:
resource "aws_instance" "bastion" {
```

So I guess, Terragrunt could output the json despite the fact that Terraform writes something to stderr...

I had an old provider version in my .terraform-cache . Although the show without -json looked like it worked, it stopped somewhere with an error. I fixed it by deleting the cache dir and reinitializing.

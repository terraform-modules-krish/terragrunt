# Make importer locals available to imported terragrunt file

**jyoder-deloitte** commented *Oct 23, 2023*

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I would like to be able to have some dynamic logic in my imported terragrunt file based on the module that is calling it.

The idea is to be able to do things like set what `generate` blocks are enabled/disabled, which files get loaded, and to control other logic with conditionals based on things set by the caller.

Super simple (and not terribly useful) example:

`module/terragrunt.hcl`:
```hcl
locals {
  module_type = "data"
}

import "root" {
  path = "../terragrunt_root.hcl"
}
```

`terragrunt_root.hcl`:
```hcl
locals {
  tags = {
    "managed-by" = "terraform"
    "ModuleType" = caller.locals.module_type
  }
}

inputs = {
  tags = local.tags
}
```

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Creating a `module.hcl` file that is read in by the root file.  This will 100% work but requires maintaining another file alongside the `terragrunt.hcl` file in each folder.

`module/module.hcl`:
```hcl
locals {
  module_type = "data"
}
```

`terragrunt_root.hcl`:
```hcl
locals {
  module_vars = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("module.hcl"))

  tags = {
    "managed-by" = "terraform"
    "ModuleType" = local.module_vars.locals.module_type
  }
}

inputs = {
  tags = local.tags
}
```

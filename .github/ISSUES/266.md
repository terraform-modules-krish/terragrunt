# No Terraform configuration files found in directory

A common issue we get from Terragrunt users is something like the following error:

```
Downloading modules (if any)...
Get: git::ssh://git@github.com/gruntwork-io/module-ecs.git?ref=v0.5.0
Error downloading modules: Error loading modules: module ecs_service: No Terraform configuration files found in directory: /private/var/folders/s1/fmkvqbdj0v38wzyd3sck_v0h0000gn/T/terragrunt/BD_3wScLWM0rOaX4H6GqMvg1KEw/lc2S_-xSO1M5_VZbM9r3nLEbEtc/services/finance-system/.terraform/modules/2c57b312914a8bcbf55a756c539a1bba/modules/ecs-service-with-alb
```

What's happening here is that Terragrunt starts by downloading the module files referenced in the `terragrunt.terraform.source` property of a `terraform.tfvars` file to a temp directory. After a while, your local OS may simply delete these temp files (after all, they're temporary!), but not necessarily the containing folder. This confuses Terragrunt since it sees that the temp folder still exists, even though it's now empty. Hence you get the error that "No Terraform configuration files found in directory".

A workaround is to simply use the `--terragrunt-source-update` option with Terragrunt (e.g. `terragrunt apply --terragrunt-source-update`) so that Terragrunt will re-download all files to a new temp directory.

A fix for this would update Terragrunt to pre-verify that the temp directory it sees is non-empty, and possibly automatically run with the `--terragrunt-source-update` option if the directory is in fact empty.

This happens because OS X seems to delete the *files* in `/tmp`, but not the folders, whereas Terragrunt's caching is merely checking for the presence of the folder. Should be an easy fix if you're up for it :)

Maybe a path like `~/.terragrunt-cache` would be more appropriate than `/tmp`?

That's actually a great point. I think it would be a simple fix too! PRs welcome :)

does anyone ever meet this problem while execute terraform plan : "Too many command line arguments. Configuration path expected"?

@jinrangcui That sounds like a Terraform error, not a Terragrunt error. Check out the Terragrunt logs to see which terraform command is being run.

I am having this same issue when trying to download modules from s3 with plain terraform
`Error downloading modules: Error loading modules: module my_module: No Terraform configuration files found in directory: .terraform/modules/eaab51770e5add74cf295e21939fa78`

I believe this is fixed by #301. The new binaries should show up in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.13.4 shortly. Please try it out!

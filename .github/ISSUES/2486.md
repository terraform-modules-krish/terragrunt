# [tflint] Revisit lock solution for hooks.

This is a follow-up from https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/2469#issuecomment-1448518004

> 4. Thought experiment: is locking on code generation and hooks in folder `xxx` the right solution? Or should we be locking on _all_ TG execution in folder `xxx`? For example, when you do `run-all apply`, we start executing, say, 3 modules concurrently: `A`, `B`, `C`. Now imagine that `A` and `B` both depends on `C` via a `dependency` blocks. Before this PR, we could run code generation and hooks in `C` twice, concurrently, once from each of `A` and `B`'s `dependency` blocks. With this PR, we now have locking on code generation and hooks... But perhaps what we really want is a _global_ lock, so that only one thing can execute `C` at a time: if we're processing a `dependency` block on `C` from `A`, then processing the `dependency` block from `B` has to wait. That will include the code generation and hooks, but also code copying, `init`, and anything else we add in the future.

> 5. Thought experiment: should code generation be idempotent? If code generation creates a file `foo.tf`, and its contents are the same as the `foo.tf` on disk, perhaps we don't overwrite it?

We can try to implement code generation  in all modules and after executing `run-all xxx` but not sure what will happen if in the common module should be generated file with content based on data from childs - may be generated content from other module

FWIW, I opened #2480 which seems to be affected by all of this new locking.  Perhaps whatever locking is done could be controlled by an option (or one that tells terragrunt that it doesn't need to do any sort of locking).  The locking seems to be creating a serialization that greatly affects our overall runtime and it seems all of this is for the one use-case where your hook is running `tflint` (or something similar) that's not concurrency-safe.  To me, this seems like an outlier, not the norm for hooks.  Anyway, just trying to bring this potential issue to light for the folks involved in this change.  I'll be trying to debug my particular issue more and provide tests, but these locking changes seem like an obvious reason for our terragrunt runs to take 2-4x longer.

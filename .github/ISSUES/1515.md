# [feature request] Print relative paths instead of absolute paths in console output

**calebplum** commented *Jan 28, 2021*

Instead of showing absolute paths, is it possible to make Terragrunt's console output show paths relative to where the command was run?

For example, commands like `validate`, `validate-all`, `plan` etc. often fill my screen with lots of line wraps and long paths which make the output unwieldy and difficult to read.

It would be really nice if Terragrunt could be configured to show relative paths instead, which would make the output much easier to read.

Hm, the downside to relative paths is, well, that they are relative... And the question always is, relative to what? The most likely answer with `run-all xxx` is that they would be relative to each module where the `xxx` command is being run, which means that the relative paths for multiple nested modules may all end up being the same (e.g., if you have multiple `vpc` folders in different envs). I wonder if that would be more confusing than helpful?

Sorry for the delay in replying.

The intention of this issue was to reduce the noise in Terragrunt's output. With the new verbosity feature and proper logging now implemented I think this issue is less relevant than it was before.

In any case, I think the best implementation of this would be if the path printed to the console was relative to the location where the Terragrunt command was run. As an example, if my Terragrunt project is located at `/home/user/Documents/git/sample-terragrunt-project` and I execute `run-all xxx` in that directory, all the paths in Terragrunt's console output will contain `/home/user/Documents/git/sample-terragrunt-project`. I already know this is where I've executed the command from, so I don't think it's necessarily helpful to repeat that path in all output events.

Having said that, areas where I can see this potentially causing confusion are in automated deployments (CI/CD pipelines) and possibly Terragrunt projects that reference Terraform modules in another repository - I haven't used this feature of Terragrunt yet so I'm not sure whether this change might cause some ambiguity there. If relevant, perhaps a command-line argument could fix that.

Understood, thanks. TBH, I don't think we want to add yet another flag to Terragrunt. It bloats the API further, which we probably don't want to do for this particular feature. If anything, we might want to do something like print relative paths by default, but absolute paths if the log level is debug or lower.

I came across this issue wondering the same thing. The logs are really verbose making debugging a bit tricky to navigate  with full paths for every single file command. Watching in case any option becomes available to help with easier to read logging, or perhaps structured logging as an option? If I could output to structured json logs then I'd just use shell/powershell to select the fields I wanted.

# TERRAGRUNT_DOWNLOAD variable for setting up centralized cache is not working as expected

**ankitcharolia** commented *Apr 11, 2023*

Hi,
I would like to have centralized terragrunt cache directory for plugin and modules, I am trying the following code snippet in root terragrunt.hcl file. TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR seems to work fine, but TERRAGRUNT_DOWNLOAD is **not working** as expected.

```
**## terragrunt.hcl (root terragrunt HCL file)**
terraform {
  before_hook "before_cache" {
    commands     = [get_terraform_command()]
    execute      = ["mkdir", "-p", abspath("${get_repo_root()}/.terragrunt-cache/.plugins")]
  }
  extra_arguments "terragrunt_plugins" {
    commands = [get_terraform_command()]
    env_vars = {
      TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR = abspath("${get_repo_root()}/.terragrunt-cache/.plugins")
      TERRAGRUNT_DOWNLOAD = abspath("${get_repo_root()}/.terragrunt-cache")
    }
  }
}```

It would be really cool for big project, if this works. I am looking forward to a fix for terragrunt-cache. 

if I export TERRAGRUNT_DOWNLOAD environment variable before executing any terragrunt plan/apply command, it works (BUT this is just a workaround)

@denis256 may I please have you input on this issue ? I would like to know if this is intended way of implementation. Thank you!

Hi,
from the description is not clear how it is working now and how it is expected to work in this case.

Environment variable `TERRAGRUNT_DOWNLOAD` should be defined before execution of `terragrunt` since it is to download dependencies before executing `terraform`. 
Declaration in `env_vars` is not helping since it is evaluated only when `terraform` is invoked.

It should work this way
```hcl
## terragrunt.hcl (root terragrunt HCL file)**
terraform {
  before_hook "before_cache" {
    commands     = [get_terraform_command()]
    execute      = ["mkdir", "-p", abspath("${get_repo_root()}/.terragrunt-cache/.plugins")]
  }
  extra_arguments "terragrunt_plugins" {
    commands = [get_terraform_command()]
    env_vars = {
      TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR = abspath("${get_repo_root()}/.terragrunt-cache/.plugins")
    }
  }
}
download_dir = abspath("${get_repo_root()}/.terragrunt-cache")
```
As per https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#download_dir
(untested though)

@ekini that works. I was missing `download_dir = abspath("${get_repo_root()}/.terragrunt-cache")`
Thank you! :)

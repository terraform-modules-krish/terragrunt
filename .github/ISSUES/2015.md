# Is it possible to filter 0 change plan from terragrunt run-all show?

**vincenttjia** commented *Feb 14, 2022*

Hi, I am currently developing a Terragrunt CI/CD pipeline for my company and have a question.

My current pipeline goes like this

```
- name: Terragrunt Staging Plan
   run: terragrunt run-all plan -out=staging.plan
          
- name: Generate Staging Plan PR Comment
  run: terragrunt run-all show -no-color staging.plan >> staging_plan.txt
```

But the plan was filled with the changes that I wanted plus a lot of these,
```
An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:

Terraform will perform the following actions:

Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
```

Is there a way to filter these out? also preferably I wanted to not apply these 0 change plan but if that is not possible then I should filter them from the apply output also. Because they are also spamming the apply output with output variables.

Any suggestion is welcomed. Thank you very much.
<br />

Hi,
not sure if that is possible since in the end, it is invocation of `terraform show` that shows plan output

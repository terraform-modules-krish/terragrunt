# Plan-All adds many of empty newlines

**ahmad-hamade** commented *Nov 10, 2020*

I've noticed that whenever I run `terragrunt plan-all` a lot of empty newlines printed out at the end of command execution:

`terragrunt version v0.26.2`

I'm using some sort of `sed` command to remove these lines but I don't understand why they are added.

Example:

Hm, weird. Does seem like a bug. If someone has time to look into this, a PR is welcome!

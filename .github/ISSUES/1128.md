# read_terragrunt_config with dependency is broken

**yorinasub17** commented *Apr 9, 2020*

## Description

`read_terragrunt_config` throws a wrench into [the configuration parsing order](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/getting-started/configuration/#configuration-parsing-order) due to the fact that the function can be called in `locals` blocks. This means that the loaded config has to be parsed in full when parsing locals. This breaks the configuration parsing order because you can now have `dependency` blocks being parsed during `locals` parsing.

This is a problem for any stack related commands (`apply-all` and their siblings) because the graph can not be constructed. In normal operations without `read_terragrunt_config`, the graph is constructed by parsing out the `dependency` and `terraform` blocks in the config (without actually retrieving the dependencies). However, with `read_terragrunt_config`, the `dependency` blocks that the module depends on are no longer visible if you do a partial configuration parse, as they are loaded when the function runs, which in most common usage will be when the `locals` are parsed. This is problematic on two fronts:

- The `dependency` isn't captured in the stack, causing the graph to be incorrect.
- We need to retrieve the dependency outputs when constructing the graph. Not only is this a performance problem, this can also break when doing an `apply-all` on the initial deployment when nothing has been deployed because the `dependency` output will be empty.

For all intents and purposes, usage of `dependency` in `read_terragrunt_config` is broken.


## Workaround

More investigation is needed to identify a workaround for this issue. Right now it appears that you could potentially workaround this issue by doing the following:

- Set `mock_outputs` on the `dependency` blocks in the config that is loaded through `read_terragrunt_config`.
- For each `dependency` block in the loaded config, the *loading config* (the one calling `read_terragrunt_config`) should define a `dependencies` block with those modules listed to force the link.

This isn't a perfect workaround because terragrunt will run `terragrunt show` in each of the dependencies in the loaded config, but it will at least preserve the apply order when doing an `apply-all`.

I don't think there is a quick win here to resolve this unless we switch to a graph based parsing scheme with lazy evaluation. I can't otherwise come up with a way to safely detect that `dependency` blocks don't need to be resolved during the partial parsing phase.

The idea I have is this:

- Find all the `dependency` blocks, both those imported through `read_terragrunt_config` and those defined in the module. Collect the `config_paths` for those.
- Parse the `terraform` blocks, but only the `source` attribute (which is the only thing needed for the graph building stage).
- When parsing blocks, take a bottom up approach. Basically we only want to parse the `locals` that are relevant to the context of parsing the blocks. This has a high chance of avoiding the penalty of looking up the dependencies in the graph building stage because it should be extremely rare for one to be referencing dependencies in the `source` attribute or the `dependency` block.

However, I am not sure if we want to be investing a lot of resources into such a complex parsing scheme. This problem may very well go away if we implement `import` blocks and put the `dependency` in there. `import` blocks have the advantage of being a specific block, which means that it is easier to find during parsing (for collecting dependencies), and easier to inject into the configuration parsing order.

Just another quick thing that this issue causes: Cyclic dependencies just hang forever.

So if moduleA uses `read_terragrunt_config` to read in a file that has a dependency on `moduleA`, calls to `terragrunt plan` will just hang indefinitely, without any errors or warnings in the logs that might point to why nothing is happening.

Was a real head-scratcher to figure out what was going on (the cycle in my codebase was quite deep in the dependency chain) ðŸ˜¬

We are trying to leverage this workaround. But it doesn't seem to work for us for the run-all apply scenario
We see the error `Call to function "read_terragrunt_config" failed` because the dependency block within the file its reading has no outputs yet
Even though the file that calls the read_terragrunt_config has a "depdencies" block on that module too

Is there another way around this?

We have a file dependencies.hcl
It has a depenency block on a moduleA
That dependency block has config and mock_outputs set and then it has 
mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands = ["validate", "refresh", "plan", "plan-all", "validate-all", "state", "force-unlock"]
as well but that does not support apply or apply-all because we need to use true outputs for apply

Then we have our main.hcl
It has a dependencies block on moduleA
It has the read_terragrunt_config to load "dependencies.hcl like
locals{
 common_deps                   = read_terragrunt_config("dependencies.hcl")
}

@lorelei-rupp-imprivata I recommend using multiple `include` blocks instead: https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#include

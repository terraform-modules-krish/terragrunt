# Fetching a module from a branch with / is broken when github.com us the source

**lazzurs** commented *Mar 1, 2023*

When using github.com as a source for a module in a sub directory the following works.

    source = "github.com/xxx/infrastructure-modules//dev-dns-zone?ref=v0.0.1"

But this does not.

    source = "github.com/xxx/infrastructure-modules//dev-dns-zone?ref=feat/PTP-1841"

The first version will run apply and plan as expected. The second version brings the following error.

`ERRO[0001] 1 error occurred:
	* error downloading 'https://github.com/xxx/infrastructure-modules.git?ref=feat': /opt/homebrew/bin/git exited with 1: error: pathspec 'feat' did not match any file(s) known to git


ERRO[0001] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1`

Something appears to be removing the / from the branch name.

Further testing has shown the following does work

      source = "git::git@github.com:xxx/infrastructure-modules//dev-dns-zone?ref=feat/PTP-1841"

For now we can switch to this but the original version should work.

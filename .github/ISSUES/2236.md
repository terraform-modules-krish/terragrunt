# [Feature Request]: Use Provider Alias with Dependency Block

**kderck** commented *Aug 15, 2022*

I would like to be able to use the `Dependency` block with providers so I can read dns_zones in other accounts to be able to create records for them dynamically. For example creating a `NS` record for a `Hosted Zone` in another account.

```hcl
dependency "dns_zones" {
  config_path = "../dns_zones"
  provider = aws.west
}
```

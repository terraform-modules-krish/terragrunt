# the vpc  has dependencies and cannot be deleted.

**Describe the bug**
a vpc re-creation fails due to dependency on another module

**To Reproduce**
Create two modules(VPC and SG)
SG is a dependency on VPC.ID 

Then change the CIDR of VPC, terragrunt will attempt to destroy the vpc and re-create it but it will fail due to dependency on security groups

```hcl

SG HCL

dependency "vpc" {
  config_path = "../network"
  mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands = ["init", "plan", "destroy"]
  mock_outputs = {
    vpc_id = "fake-vpc-id"
  }
}

inputs = {
  vpc_id = dependency.vpc.outputs.vpc_id
}
```

**Expected behavior**
I expect it to propagate through the dependencies including the SG 

**Nice to have**

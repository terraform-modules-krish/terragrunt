# Not able to reference inputs from dependency file in dependency

**gibsster** commented *Apr 22, 2021*

Hello,

My dependency file looks as follows 

```
inputs = {
  env_name = "int-14"
}
```

Part of my Terragrunt file:

```
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

terraform {
  source = "git::ssh://alm.oraclecorp.com:2222/acs_terraform_26775/main-infrastructure.git//common_infrastructure/load_balancer?ref=master"
}

dependency "compute" {
  config_path = "../../redis/compute"
}


locals {
  env_deps    = read_terragrunt_config("../../env_common_deps.hcl")
}

inputs = {

  backend_sets             = {
    "bes-1-redis-${local.env_deps.inputs.env_name}" = {
      policy               = "ROUND_ROBIN"
      health_check_name    = "redis_tcp"
      enable_persistency   = true
      enable_ssl           = false

      cookie_name          = null
      disable_fallback     = null
      certificate_name     = null
      verify_depth         = null
      verify_peer_certificate = false

      backends             = {
        be1                = {
          ip               = "dependency.compute.outputs.instances.oasp-${local.env_deps.inputs.env_name}-redis-1"
          port             = 6379
          backup           = false
          drain            = false
          offline          = false
          weight           = 1
        },
        be2                = {
          ip               = dependency.compute.outputs.instances.oasp-int-14-redis-2
          port             = 6379
          backup           = false
          drain            = false
          offline          = false
          weight           = 1
        },
      }
    }
  }

}
```

As you can see, I have an input in my dependency file called `env_name` that I pass to all my terragrunt files. 
In that particular Terragrunt file, I need to pass the IP address coming from an output like this 

```
instances = {
  "oasp-int-14-redis-1" = "100.100.180.94"
  "oasp-int-14-redis-2" = "100.100.180.93"
}
```
So If I do this ` ip = dependency.compute.outputs.instances.oasp-int-14-redis-2` it works fine. However, I need to find a way to dynamically pass the environment name without hardcoding it in all my Terragrunt files  so I tried this ` ip  = "dependency.compute.outputs.instances.oasp-${local.env_deps.inputs.env_name}-redis-1"` but that didn't work what I got as IP address was `dependency.compute.outputs.instances.oasp-int-14-redis-1` instead of `100.100.180.94` I've been trying multiple combinations but haven't been able to figure that out.

Hope somebody knows the trick or workaround in case Terragrunt doesn't support it.

Thanks,
Carlos

I was able to fix it by using index syntax 
`dependency.compute.outputs.instances["oasp-${local.env_deps.inputs.env_name}-redis-1"]`

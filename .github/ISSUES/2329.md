# lifecycle configuration of S3 remote state

**ebini** commented *Oct 21, 2022*

We use terragrunt with S3 versioning. 
According to the AWS Documentation: "S3 buckets with versioning enabled should have lifecycle policies configured"

Is it possible to add a lifecycle rule to the S3 remote state bucket?

My question:
a) Is it possible to configure this with the remote state configuration (or it may be a feature request)
b) Is there another "best practises" way to add a lifecycle rule to the created s3 bucket?

Thanks in advance

Hi,
AFAIK lifecycle policies from Terragrunt can't be set, only configured `skip_bucket_versioning=true/false`.

Can be attempted to configure lifecycle through Terraform(that may be some kind of recursion)

sorry for my late response. 
wouldn't this a nice feature request do add some more basic configuration to the bucket like lifeccycle policies?

Bump on the above, we're running a security audit through our accounts and that was also noticed. Is there any reason why this is not supported?

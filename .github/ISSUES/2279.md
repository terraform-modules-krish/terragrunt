# Terragrunt fetch dependency output from state functionality unsupported for "generated" backed configuration

**jlepere-everlaw** commented *Sep 15, 2022*

From what I can tell, the [terragrunt-fetch-dependency-output-from-state](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli-options/#terragrunt-fetch-dependency-output-from-state) feature (added in #2123) only works when the [remote_state](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#remote_state) block is used to define the terraform backend configuration. I believe the following code governs this.

https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/7788a525ab61641211e3f8a127ed53b450e96bc8/config/dependency.go#L539-L547

Therefore, if a [generate](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#generate) block is instead used to define the backend configuration, we'll never hit the following line of code and the benefits of `terragrunt-fetch-dependency-output-from-state`.

Does that make sense? Would it be possible to read the backend configuration from the generated `terraform` block, regardless of where it's generated from?

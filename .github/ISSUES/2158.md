# `get_path_to_repo_root()` includes trailing slash unlike other functions

**tjstansell** commented *Jun 22, 2022*

The path returned by `get_path_to_repo_root()` includes a trailing `/` where it looks like all other path functions do not.  When building a `source` based on this, it causes `//` problems.

For instance, using the normal expression like this:
```
source = "${get_path_to_repo_root()}/modules//my-thing"
```
it actually resolves to the path `../..//modules//my-thing`.  This causes the entire repo to get copied as the source.  So, now I have to write my expression as:
```
source = "${get_path_to_repo_root()}modules//my-thing"
```
to get the expected path of `../../modules//my-thing`.

Correcting this will likely cause problems for folks.  Either they lose the `//` they currently expect or their existing expression (like my second example above) is no longer a valid path.

# Create logo for terragrunt

**antonbabenko** commented *Sep 17, 2018*

Well, I know that this is not a traditional issue.

I sometimes need to refer to [terragrunt](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt) in my slides/talks/repositories/blog posts and there is no logo for this open-source project which I can use.

@brikis98 What are your thoughts about this?

We haven't had time to do this, but yes, a logo would be great. Design ideas welcome üëç

I have been thinking about this several times and nothing really good came to my mind. Maybe twitter can help - https://twitter.com/antonbabenko/status/1041629587942371329 :)

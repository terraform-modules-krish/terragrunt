# graph-dependencies does not follow include dependencies

**dmikalova** commented *Oct 10, 2021*

I have been using `include` blocks to DRY repeated dependencies, however graph-dependencies does not follow these transitive dependencies. Example configs:

example/terragrunt.hcl:
```
dependency "container_registry" {
  config_path = "../../../dmikalova/container-registry/"
}

include "kubernetes" {
  path = find_in_parent_folders("kubernetes.hcl")
}

include "terraform" {
  path = find_in_parent_folders("terraform.hcl")
}

inputs = {
  container_registry_info = dependency.container_registry.outputs.info
}

terraform {
  source = "git@gitlab.com:e91e63/terraform-digitalocean-kubernetes.git//modules/service-account-container-registry/"
}
```
kubernetes.hcl:
```
dependency "kubernetes" {
  config_path = "${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/kubernetes/"
}

generate "kubernetes" {
  contents  = file(find_in_parent_folders("terraform/providers/kubernetes.tf"))
  if_exists = "overwrite"
  path      = "provider-kubernetes.tf"
}

inputs = {
  k8s_info = dependency.kubernetes.outputs.info
}
```

When graphing these, I would expect `example` to be dependent on `kubernetes`, but `graph-dependencies` shows that it is only dependent on `container-registry`.

I can't repro this in my test case, but I think I have a sense as to what is going on here.

Can you share your folder structure, and which folder you are running the `terragrunt graph-dependencies` call from? My guess is that the `graph-dependencies` call is running from a nested folder, and you are not including external dependencies into the list, so `terragrunt` isn't including the `kubernetes` module because it's not in the list of modules to graph.

If you run it from the root, you should be able to get the full graph. Or alternatively, if you include the `kubernetes` folder using [--terragrunt-include-dir](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli-options/#terragrunt-include-dir), it should show the right graph.

@yorinasub17 Thanks for looking into this.

[Here is the repo](https://gitlab.com/dmikalova/infrastructure)
[kubernetes.hcl](https://gitlab.com/dmikalova/infrastructure/-/blob/master/digitalocean/e91e63/kubernetes.hcl) file that's included
[container-registry-service-account](https://gitlab.com/dmikalova/infrastructure/-/blob/master/digitalocean/e91e63/manifests/service-account-container-registry/terragrunt.hcl) module that is including kubernetes.hcl but is disconnected in the graph.

I am running `terragrunt graph-dependencies | dot -Tsvg > graph.svg` from the root of the repo and get this graph, notice that container-registry-service-account is disconnected on the right side, and most of the configs in the [services](https://gitlab.com/dmikalova/infrastructure/-/tree/master/digitalocean/e91e63/services) dir are disconnected from kubernetes, although alpine and 2048 are connected even though they also use the include:

Thanks for the reproducible case. This is indeed a bug and I will be investigating it.

This should be fixed in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.35.0

Thanks for the quick fix, the graph now looks as expected!

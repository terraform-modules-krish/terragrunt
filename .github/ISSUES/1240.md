# Remote source for dependency block

**ahmedfourti** commented *Jun 28, 2020*

Hello guys,

This is a question, not an issue.
Is it possible to use `dependency` block by using remote location instead of local path ?
Example: instead using `.../vpc`, use something like `git` repos

Thanks alot,
<br />

Currently, only local file paths are supported with `dependency` blocks. Adding support for cloning a Git repo would be inline with how the `source` param works in Terragrunt, so a PR to add that is welcome. Note that this would make `dependency` blocks even slower: running `terragrunt output` already takes some time; putting a `git clone` before that will take even longer.

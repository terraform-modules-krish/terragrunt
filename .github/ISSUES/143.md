# extra_arguments doesn't work when downloading remote Terraform configurations

**brikis98** commented *Feb 22, 2017*

Imagine you have the following folder structure:

```
infra-live
└ global.tfvars
└ stage
    └ terraform.tfvars
```

The `stage/terraform.tfvars` has the following contents:

```hcl
terragrunt = {
  terraform {
    source = "git::git@github.com:foo/bar.git//frontend-app?ref=v0.0.3"
  }

  extra_arguments "global" {
    arguments = [
      "-var-file=terraform.tfvars",
      "-var-file=../global.tfvars"
    ]
  }
}
```

When you run `terragrunt apply` in `stage`, it will fail, because it will download the Terraform code into a temporary folder, switch to that folder, and then try to use the relative path to `global.tfvars`. Since `global.tfvars` is in the infra-live folder and not the temp folder, it won't find it.

Ideas on possible fixes:

1. Explicitly parse `extra_arguments` for `-var-file` arguments and automatically copy those into the proper folder structure in the temporary folder. This sounds like it would be *very* messy.

1. Instead of downloading code into a temporary folder, download it into the current folder, run Terraform, and then clean up. Again, this sounds like it would be *very* messy.

1. Add a new helper similar to `${path.module}`. For example:

    ```hcl
    arguments = [
      "-var-file=${path.module}/terraform.tfvars",
      "-var-file=${path.module}/../global.tfvars"
    ]
    ```

    Terragrunt would automatically fill in the path of the original working directory, so those relative paths would become absolute paths. 

The third option seems like the proper solution and it should be pretty easy to implement. Anyone up for a PR?

As a workaround you can symlink `../global.tfvars` into your stage directory and reference the symlink file into the `extra_argument` block. This way you can reuse the same global.tfvars everywhere without code duplication.

example:
```
infra-live
└ global.tfvars
└ stage
    └ terraform.tfvars
    └ global.tfvars (symlink -> ../global.tfvars)
```

`stage/terraform.tfvars`:
```
terragrunt = {
  terraform {
    source = "git::git@github.com:foo/bar.git//frontend-app?ref=v0.0.3"
  }

  extra_arguments "global" {
    arguments = [
      "-var-file=terraform.tfvars",
      "-var-file=global.tfvars"
    ]
  }
}
```

Whoops, meant to hit comment, but hit close. Reopened this one until #168 is merged :)

# viewing state with terragrunt

**deric4** commented *Jun 1, 2018*

Trying to figure out how to run the equivalent command with terragrunt:

 `terraform state show  module.vpc.aws_flow_log.this` or `terraform state list`

I can `plan`, `apply`, etc no problem with:

`terragrunt plan --terragrunt-source ...`.


When attempting to run the state list command with terragrunt however:

`terragrunt state list --terragrunt-source ...` I get the following output

```console.log
Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...

The following providers do not have any version constraints in configuration,
so the latest version was installed.

To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking
changes, it is recommended to add version = "..." constraints to the
corresponding provider blocks in configuration, with the constraint strings
suggested below.

* provider.aws: version = "~> 1.21"

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

No state file was found!

State management commands require a state file. Run this command
in a directory where Terraform has been run or use the -state flag
to point the command to a specific state location.

I feel like I'm doing something wrong but don't know if I've missed something in the docs

Does that module have a state file? Did you `terragrunt apply` it?

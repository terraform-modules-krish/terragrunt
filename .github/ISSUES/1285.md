# Terragrunt is painful to use in AWS CodeBuild

**SizZiKe** commented *Aug 5, 2020*

AWS CodeBuild is a build tool in which I'm looking to leverage Terragrunt.

I have two different CodeBuild projects, one for `terragrunt plan` and one for `terragrunt apply`. CodeBuild automatically brings in artifacts assigned to the project but does not necessarily place them in the same directory each time, e.g.:
`terragrunt plan` source path `[Container] 2020/08/05 19:06:00 CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR=/codebuild/output/src745/src/s3/00`
`terragrunt apply` source path `[Container] 2020/08/05 19:07:20 CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR=/codebuild/output/src325/src/s3/00`

Because of the fact that the `.terragrunt-cache` directory is determined not only by the parent folder, but also the absolute path to the parent folder (or something like that), I have to manually force the cache to match that of the apply step, otherwise I lose the cache which I am trying to preserve (which contains my Terraform plan, as an example).

What I'm doing as a workaround (thankfully I figured this out before having an aneurysm):
```YAML
      - cd "$CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR/${directory}" # directory for apply
      - old_cache="$(pwd)/$(echo .terragrunt-cache/*/*)" # construct complete path for old cache
      - new_cache=$(terragrunt terragrunt-info --terragrunt-no-auto-init | jq -r '.WorkingDir') # run terragrunt-info to obtain new cache location
      - echo "OLD CACHE=$old_cache"
      - echo "NEW CACHE=$new_cache"
      - test "$old_cache" = "$new_cache" || (rm -rf "$new_cache" && mv -v "$old_cache" "$new_cache") # if they are the same, don't do anything (rare, but could happen). If not, remove the new cache and move old cache to new location
      - terragrunt apply terraform.tfplan
```

Are you able to leverage [--terragrunt-download-dir](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli-options/#terragrunt-download-dir) so that it is always in the same place?

Alternatively, could you use an absolute path for the plan output so that it is easier to discover and pass around? E.g., putting it in `repo_root/generated_plans` or something like that?

@yorinasub17  It doesn't appear to work that way, Terragrunt is calculating the hashes based on the current directory the Terraform exists in, not the download directory.

If I moved the Terraform directory to the same location, e.g. /tmp/dir, and then run Terragrunt from there, that would work. Perhaps that is a more elegant solution rather than the cache renaming that I'm doing...but I don't feel good about either solution.

@yorinasub17 looking for some more input here, I have found a workaround per the code above but this isn't ideal.

@wolfgz Sorry for the delay in responding here, but I haven't been able to find time to look into this unfortunately. If anyone in the community is able to investigate this further to suggest a code fix, that would be much appreciated!

My solution also isn't great, but is as follows (My Terragrunt/Terraform is in the 'infra' folder):

```yaml
phases:
  build:
    commands:
      - mkdir -p /tmp/infra
      - cp -R ${CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR}/infra /tmp
      - cd /tmp/infra
<snip>
cache:
  paths:
    - '/terragrunt-cache/**/*'
```

In the terragrunt.hcl file at root we specify our download_dir

```hcl
download_dir = "/terragrunt-cache/${path_relative_to_include()}"
```

This seems like a "good enough" solution for even complex Terragrunt/Terraform repos. CodeBuild using a unique folder every run does seem to conflict with the caching methodology of Terragrunt, but I don't see a clear resolution.

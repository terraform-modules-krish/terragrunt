# Adding terraform flags after a terragrunt apply with a plan file will not remove var arguments

**ayqazi** commented *Feb 13, 2020*

Assume I have configured terragrunt to pass -var and -var-file arguments to TF.

Now I call terragrunt apply <plan file>

Those -var and -var-file arguments are not passed onto terraform. Great. As it should be.

However, if I then do terragrunt apply <plan file> -no-color

Then those arguments ARE passed onto terraform.

I feel this should not be so.

See https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/983, as I believe that is the root problem.

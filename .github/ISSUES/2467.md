# TFLint execution fail on reading generated files

**denis256** commented *Feb 23, 2023*

Found that in case of multiple dependent modules, execution of tflint hook may fail on reading random files from `.terragrunt-cache` directory

```
Failed to load configurations; :0,0-0: Failed to read file; The file "../../../../../../../../../_regional/ecr-repos/.terragrunt-cache/7I4-il5IuWxHyoYlk8UCZ4i7ALo/fCw8UgbtyEKZwmAHcT_oAWkqDzs/modules/data-stores/ecr-repos/outputs.tf" does not exist., and 3 other diagnostic(s):

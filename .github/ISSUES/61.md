# release lock on SIGTERM too.

**mildred** commented *Dec 1, 2016*

On SIGINT (Interrupt from keyboard), terragrunt release the lock, but not on SIGTERM (Termination signal). This should probably be fixed. See `locks/lock.go`.

Additionally, terragrunt should forward SIGTERM signals to terraform. There is no guaantee that terraform will have received it. See also hashicorp/terraform#10459

In fact, on some cases (default on systemd services) SIGTERM is sent to all processes in the cgroup. In other cases (sysvservice, docker) the SIGTERM signal is only sent to the parent process.

Good point. Looks like you have some code written for this already. Would you like to submit a PR?

**mildred** commented *Dec 5, 2016*

Yes, I will submit a PR once I get something with terraform. There are two aspects:

- handle SIGTERM as well as SIGINT
- make sure terraform has received SIGTERM. When we type Ctrl-C in a terminal, the VT will make sure that all VT clients are sent a SIGINT signal. With SIGTERM, we are not sure that terraform received SIGTERM and we must probably forward the signal.

Are you ok with forwarding the SIGTERM signal ?

When forwarding SIGTERM we must make sure terraform can handle it. Currently it does not respond to SIGTERM and doesn't cleanly finish like it does with Ctrl-C. I'm currently submitting a PR on terraform for that.

Probably makes sense to wait for your PR to be merged into Terraform itself.

This should have been fixed by #72.

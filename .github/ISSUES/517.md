# validate-all broken since v0.16.0

**ldormoy** commented *Jul 10, 2018*

v0.16.0 creates a .terragrunt-cache directory.

When I run terragrunt validate-all, I get:
`10:51 $ terragrunt validate-all
[terragrunt] [/home/me/git/project/staging/eu-west-1/networking] 2018/07/10 10:51:50 Running command: terraform --version

How this module was found: Terragrunt config file found in a subdirectory of /home/me/git/project/staging/eu-west-1/networking.

Only one level of includes is allowed.

Obviously the .terraform-cache subdirectory should be excluded.

Ah, that's my bad. We run `plan-all` and `apply-all` in tests, so I'm not sure how that was missed! I'll try to get a fix out today. Thanks for reporting.

Just pushed https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.16.1. New binaries should show up shortly. Let me know if that fixes the issue for you!

Nope, still happening (also with plan-all and I guess apply-all).

I suppose your tests don't catch it because you delete the workspace/container between each run, so they never use the cache directory?

The first lines of plan-all:
```
$ terragrunt -version
terragrunt version v0.16.1
$ terragrunt plan-all
[terragrunt] [/home/me/git/project] 2018/07/10 15:54:43 Running command: terraform --version
[terragrunt] 2018/07/10 15:54:43 Module /home/me/git/project does not have an associated terraform configuration and will be skipped.

Hm, that's perplexing. I'll look more into it tomorrow. Thx for the report.

**brikis98** commented *Jul 11, 2018*

OK, let's try this one more time ðŸ˜„ 

https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.16.2

Binaries should be there in a few minutes.

Looks good now!

Thanks for the quick fixes @brikis98

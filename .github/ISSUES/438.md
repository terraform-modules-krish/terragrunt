# Terragrunt doesn't die when given misspelled root command: 'paln-all'

**Roberttmoon** commented *Mar 16, 2018*

As the title implies, I misspelled plan in `plan-all` and Terragrunt ran without inputs. The other root commands also are able to start Terragrunt. 

This is very confusing because it will likely output a misleading error.

Not sure I follow. Can you paste the log output of what happened? Did you not just get an error from Terraform that says `paln-all` isn't a valid command?

Running with a misspelled root command only sends back errors about Terragrunt as if it were running at the local file path. In my case it was not cloning down the module repositories via git and returned an error saying that the `s3 backend was not set`. If you spell the root command incorrectly it will still run Terragrunt targeting just the file in the directory you are in, and error that it could not find the expected `*.tfvars` files. Below is my quick and dirty example.

file structure: 
```
.
├── README.md
├── modules
│   └── s3_bucket
│       ├── s3.tf
│       └── variables.tf
└── provider
    ├── account.tfvars
    ├── terraform.tfvars
    └── us-east-1
        └── buckets
            └── example_bucket
                └── terraform.tfvars
```

Terraform module file:
```
provider "aws" {
  region = "${var.aws_region}"
}

terraform {
  backend "s3" {}
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "basic_bucket" {
  bucket = "${var.bucket_name}"
}

variable "aws_region" {}
variable "bucket_name" {}
```

and the Terragrunt files are:
account:
```
tfstate_global_bucket        = "moon-backend-bucket"
tfstate_global_bucket_region = "us-east-1"
```
root terraform.tfvars file
```
terragrunt = {
  remote_state {
    backend = "s3"

    config {
      encrypt        = true
      bucket         = "moon-backend-bucket"
      key            = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terrafrom.tfstate"
      region         = "us-east-1"
      dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
    }
  }

  terraform {
    extra_arguments "bucket" {
      commands = ["${get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars()}"]
      optional_var-files = [
        "${get_tfvars_dir()}/${find_in_parent_folders("account.tfvars", "ignore")}"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

and the s3 terraform.tfvars
```
terragrunt = {
  terraform {
    source = "../../../../modules/s3_bucket"
  }

  include = {
    path = "${find_in_parent_folders()}"
  }
}

aws_region  = "us-east-1"
bucket_name = "moon-test-terragrunt-bucket"
```

If you use the above with `.../TerragruntExample/provider$ terragunt plan-all` Terragrunt will build the bucket normally but if you run with `.../TerragruntExample/provider$ terragrunt paln-all` it will return with the error:
```
[terragrunt] 2018/03/17 17:07:18 Found remote_state settings in /[redacted]/TerragruntExample/provider/terraform.tfvars but no backend block in the Terraform code in /[redacted]/TerragruntExample/provider. You must define a backend block (it can be empty!) in your Terraform code or your remote state settings will have no effect! It should look something like this:

terraform {
  backend "s3" {}
}


[terragrunt] 2018/03/17 17:07:18 Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1 ```

If you just read the error message with out following the file paths it could lead to chasing ghosts.

Ah, thanks for the clear explanation and repro example. This is indeed a very confusing error message!

The cause is the following:

1. When you run `plan-all` or any of the other valid `xxx-all` commands, Terragrunt searches subfolders for modules to deploy, and it finds one in the `us-east-1/buckets/example_bucket` folder. Therefore, everything works fine.

1. When you run any other command, Terragrunt looks for a module in the *current* folder, which in your example is `providers`. It turns out that folder has a `terraform.tfvars` with a `terragrunt = { ... }` configuration, so Terragrunt tries to process it. That configuration has `remote_state` settings, so Terragrunt is making sure you have a `backend "s3" { ... }` somewhere in your `.tf` files. As there are no `.tf` files in the `providers` folder, it exits with an error. 

FWIW, the logs do explain what's going on:

```
[terragrunt] 2018/03/18 14:32:49 Reading Terragrunt config file at /tmp/TerragruntExample/provider/terraform.tfvars
[terragrunt] 2018/03/18 14:32:49 Found remote_state settings in /tmp/TerragruntExample/provider/terraform.tfvars but no backend block in the Terraform code in /tmp/TerragruntExample/provider.
```

The same error would've happened, and been more obvious, if you had just ran a valid command such as `terragrunt plan`, though I think a better error message in this case would be "no *.tf files found in the provider folder." I'd welcome a PR to add this additional check!

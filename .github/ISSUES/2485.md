# [tflint] Add `defer` to hooks lock

**marinalimeira** commented *Mar 15, 2023*

This is a follow-up from https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/2469/files#r1119087994

Inside the loops for `processHooks`, there is no `defer` in the `actualLock.Unlock`. In case of a `panic`, the locks are not released.

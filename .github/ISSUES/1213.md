# terragrunt not showing output from terraform -version

**dmead** commented *Jun 8, 2020*

during any terragunt action it will show this line

```
> terragrunt plan
2020/06/08 12:12:26 Running command: terraform --version

```

and doesn't show the terraform version. this makes it hard to debug some language issues because I'm not sure what terragrunt is actually running. should this be printing a version string?

We deliberately don't print out the terraform version as it is not necessary in the logs, but I can see how that might be useful. I think we can use [util.Debugf](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/util/logger.go#L29) in [cli.PopulateTerraformVersion](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/cli/version_check.go#L18) to only log the terraform version when in debug logging mode. Would you be up for a PR to add this in?

@yorinasub17 why are you running `terraform --version` then?

To enforce terraform version constraints (tg 0.19+ only works with terraform 0.12+ by default, but is customizable with [terraform_version_constraint](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#terraform_version_constraint)).

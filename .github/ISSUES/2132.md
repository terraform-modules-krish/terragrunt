# fork/exec /bin/terraform: argument list too long with long variable

**ArchiFleKs** commented *Jun 3, 2022*

Hi,

I'm currently using Terragrunt with the Hashicorp Vault provider and [this module](https://github.com/particuleio/terraform-vault-config).

I need to path some long variable as an input (a policy file with more than 1000 lines in it for example). I guess because Terragrunt passes input as environments variable, it hits the maximum number of argument and also the max size of an environment variable.

I'm not sure there is a workaround for this due to the way Terragrunt works. I have not tested with native Terraform but I suspect it would work.

Happened to me too, would really like to hear some solutions, trying to set ulimit did not work

Hi,
yes, Terragrunt uses environment variables `TF_VAR_*` to pass into Terraform, AFAIK to increase env variable size will be required to recompile kernel... as workaround I think can be attempted to generate `variables.tf` from Terragrunt with required content which will be picked automatically by Terraform

@denis256 Can you please further explain how one can generate a `variables.tf` file from terragrunt? thanks you

Hi,
can be used `generate` block and produce `auto.tfvars` files that will be picked automatically by Terraform:

```
locals {
  content = "....long-variable...."
}

generate "vars" {
  path      = "variables.auto.tfvars"
  if_exists = "overwrite"
  contents = <<EOF
content = "${local.content}"
EOF
}
```

@denis256 Thanks a lot! this works and really a very good solution, thanks for the quick and detailed help really appreciate it :) I didn't open the ticket but I would consider it resolved

Haven't tried it yet but seems like a good workaround thanks !

Although there is a workaround for this issue I would expect to keep this issue open and be addressed by terragrunt itself. Any chance we can solve this directly in terragrunt?

@denis256 you mentioned increase env variable size, what variable is that? i am thinking of recompiling kernel.

# Race condition on http backends, when module is nested

**ch9hn** commented *Apr 14, 2023*

Hello,

we are using Terragrunt with a Gitlab HTTP Terraform backend.
Here we have the problem, that when a module is nested under another module, the CI/CD fails due a state lock race condition.

Structure is as follows:

terraform/
├─ terragrunt.hcl
├─ k8s/
│  ├─ argocd/
│  │  ├─ terragrunt.hcl
│  ├─ terragrunt.hcl



Content argocd.hcl


```
terraform {
  source = "${include.root.locals.source_url}//modules/k8s-cluster/argocd?ref=${include.root.locals.source_version}"
}

include "root" {
  path   = find_in_parent_folders("${get_terragrunt_dir()}/../terragrunt.hcl")
  expose = true
}

dependency "k8s-cluster" {
  config_path                             = "../k8s-cluster/"
  mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands = ["init", "validate", "plan", "providers", "terragrunt-info", "show"]
  mock_outputs = {
    cluster_endpoint = "mock-cluster-endpoint"
    cluster_ca_cert  = "bW9ja21vY2ttb2NrbW9ja21vY2ttb2Nr"
    cluster_token    = "bW9ja21vY2ttb2NrbW9ja21vY2ttb2Nr"
  }
  mock_outputs_merge_strategy_with_state = "shallow"
}

inputs = {
  argocd_namespace = "argocd"
  argocd_helm_chart_version = "5.27.3"
  argocd_values_file = "values-repo.yaml"
  cluster_endpoint = dependency.k8s-cluster.outputs.cluster_endpoint
  cluster_ca_cert  = dependency.k8s-cluster.outputs.cluster_ca_cert
  cluster_token    = dependency.k8s-cluster.outputs.cluster_token

}

```

Error:

```
╷
│ Error: Error acquiring the state lock
│ 
│ Error message: Unexpected HTTP response code 404
│ 
│ Terraform acquires a state lock to protect the state from being written

```

Did someone have similar issues ?

Hi,
looks based on the error message, looks like it is "Not found" 404 error
Maybe will show more details running with `--terragrunt-log-level debug`

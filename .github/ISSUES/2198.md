# Add "reverse dependency" information to render-json

**brikis98** commented *Jul 15, 2022*

Currently, when you run the `render-json` command for module `foo`, it includes `dependency` information, showing you other modules that `foo` depends on: e.g., if `foo` contains a `dependency` block pointing to `bar`, then `bar` is in the `dependency` output of `render-json`. It would be useful to add "reverse dependency" information, showing what other modules depend on `foo`: e.g., if `baz` contains a `dependency` block pointing to `foo`, then `baz` shows up in the `reverse-dependency` output of `render-json` for `foo`. This way, any tool introspecting Terragrunt configs using the `render-json` command would be able to see the dependency graph in both directions.

I believe we already know how to fetch this information as per https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1823, so I would guess it's just a matter of exposing it in `render-json`?

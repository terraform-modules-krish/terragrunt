# Terragrunt doesn't show messages when waiting for console input

**dkossako** commented *Oct 1, 2021*

Hello,

I found issue in terragrunt v0.33.2, when it waits for console input it waits, but does not show any messages before, take a look on log:

```
$ terragrunt run-all plan
INFO[0000] Stack at /infrastructure-reference/prod:
  => Module /infrastructure-reference/prod/_global/_global/monitoring/budget (excluded: false, dependencies: [])
  => Module /infrastructure-reference/prod/eu-west-1/prod/networking/vpc (excluded: false, dependencies: []) 
WARN[0000] No double-slash (//) found in source URL /binbashar/cost-budget/aws. Relative paths in downloaded Terraform code may not work.  prefix=[/infrastructure-reference/prod/_global/_global/monitoring/budget]

```
At it waits and waits at this moment, until I will not press n or enter, then it shows a message it was waiting for any input:
```

Hello, can be shared any example code where this issue happens?

I tested on some generic repository:
https://github.com/denis256/terragrunt-test-1815

and it works fine:
```
$ terragrunt run-all plan

INFO[0000] Stack at /tmp/1842/terragrunt-test-1815:
  => Module /tmp/1842/terragrunt-test-1815/applications/gateway/app1 (excluded: false, dependencies: [/tmp/1842/terragrunt-test-1815/shared/service-discovery-core])
  => Module /tmp/1842/terragrunt-test-1815/applications/gateway/app2 (excluded: false, dependencies: [/tmp/1842/terragrunt-test-1815/shared/service-discovery-core])

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # local_file.config_file will be created
  + resource "local_file" "config_file" {
      + content              = "vpc"
      + directory_permission = "0777"
      + file_permission      = "0777"
      + filename             = "./vpc.txt"
      + id                   = (known after apply)
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
....
```

This should now be fixed in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.34.3

This bug is still present for me on 0.35.6

The same issue is also present when using the Terraform console via Terragrunt. You cannot see the line you typing on

Hi @barrydobson, do you have an example repository where this issue appears?

On test repository confirmation dialogs are printed out:

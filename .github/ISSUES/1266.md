# Proposal: standardize terragrunt hcl files read in via read_terragrunt_config to tg.hcl extension (for editor support)

**yorinasub17** commented *Jul 26, 2020*

**NOTE**: This is specifically for terragrunt hcl files that are read in with `read_terragrunt_config` or `import` blocks in the future. This extension does not apply to the `terragrunt.hcl` file and that will remain the same.


I started working on a [dedicated vim syntax plugin for terragrunt](https://github.com/yorinasub17/vim-terragrunt), and realized that it is not ideal to assign all `hcl` files to use the terragrunt syntax highlighting, since not all `hcl` files are terragrunt config files.

This is a proposal to standardize docs and examples to use the `.tg.hcl` extension instead of `.hcl` to indicate terragrunt config files (in addition to the base `terragrunt.hcl` file) so that we can have more dedicated editor plugins that operate on terragrunt configuration files, without compromising the ability to work with other `hcl` files that use the `hcl` extension (e.g., packer uses `.pkr.hcl`).

What's different about Terragrunt syntax highlighting than normal HCL?

We can highlight terragrunt keywords. See https://github.com/yorinasub17/vim-terragrunt/blob/main/syntax/terragrunt.vim#L29 and https://github.com/yorinasub17/vim-terragrunt/blob/main/syntax/terragrunt.vim#L22 .

This will also help when developing a terragrunt language server and adding autocompletion for the terragrunt structs.

And is file extension the _only_ way these tools match? Or do they do a content scan too?

Seems like many file extensions (e.g., `.yml`) are used for all sorts of different tools...

File extension is one of the more convenient and efficient ways to do this, since this is what the editors are optimized for. Otherwise, we need to inject some sort of marker into the file (e.g., `# vi:syntax=terragrunt` would force the file to be parsed as terragrunt), or add some special logic to look for editor specific markers into the plugins.

I don't think I ever come across language servers for `yaml`, or tools that autocomplete yaml, which is a weakness of using yaml as a config file as opposed to dedicated language constructs.

To be explicit, I am only proposing this as a convention to use for editor support. Nothing should change in terragrunt, and we should continue to support reading in and using plain `.hcl` extensions. In fact, all the blocks that read terragrunt config support any file name, so it doesn't even have to be called `.hcl`.

What about using the file name rather than extension? Match on `terragrunt.hcl` and `terragrunt-*.hcl`? 

I'm just trying to avoid renaming the Terragrunt config file _again_. We had `.terragrunt`, `terraform.tfvars`, `terragrunt.hcl`, and now one more...

Oh I think you might be misunderstanding me. This proposal is specifically targetting the hcl files we are importing with `read_terragrunt_config`. We basically keep the `terragrunt.hcl` file and the other hcl files will use the `.tg.hcl`.

Ohhhhhh. Haha, OK, yea, that's fine. Might want to update title/description accordingly :)

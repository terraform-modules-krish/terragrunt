# get_aws_account_id() to fetch the role's account id instead of aws profile's account id

**ebarault** commented *Nov 23, 2017*

I'm using `get_aws_account_id()` to assure uniqueness of the storage bucket per AWS account as in 
```
terragrunt = {
  remote_state {
    backend = "s3"
    config {
      bucket = "mycompany-${get_aws_account_id()}"
    }
  }
}
```

and I run terragrunt commands with the `--terragrunt-iam-role` option to assume a role located in a **member** aws account that belongs to my aws organization.

The profile used to launch the terragrunt commands and assume the role is from the **master** aws account.

I deploy each environment in a dedicated account.

Now, the problem is that `get_aws_account_id()` returns the account id of the **master** account, while the bucket and lock tables are created in the **member** account, meaning that for the next environment I will deploy, the S3 bucket will be the same, as the account id would not change.

Is there a way to make `get_aws_account_id()` return the account id of the assumed role instead?

Ah, interesting find. I guess it is a bit ambiguous which account that's referring to! I guess from a "principle of least surprise" aspect, `--terragrunt-iam-role` feels like it should affect everything globally, so probably that method should assume an IAM role before looking up the account id. I'd welcome a PR to fix that.

I'd be glad to have this landed rather quickly, as i'm starting a new multi-account project and would like to avoid writing down the account ids in the **remote_state** config.

Could you indicate a starting point?

Right here: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/config/config_helpers.go#L348

excellent, i'll work on it until the end of week, hopefully.

@brikis98 : could I reach you through gitter (or whatever IM of your choosing) ? I'd just need a quick help with terragrunt's development environment

@ebarault Probably your best bet is to post in https://community.gruntwork.io.

+1 on https://community.gruntwork.io/. We check it regularly.

**ebarault** commented *Nov 23, 2017*

ok, just to make sure: I was referring to 'developing terragrunt' (this PR), not 'using terragrunt'

**brikis98** commented *Nov 23, 2017*

Yup, I hear ya. Same place for that :)

I can't find an existing test for `get_aws_account_id()`, am i missing it ?
***

**brikis98** commented *Nov 23, 2017*

It doesn't look like there is one. To some extent, it's hard to create one, as that value would be different for every user running the test.
***

**ebarault** commented *Nov 23, 2017*

hmm, just as in the `dynamodb` tests, one would have to configure credentials and the proper role
***

**ebarault** commented *Nov 23, 2017*

ok, now i see what could be done with the PR, but before trying a fix : is there a kind of registry inside of terragrunt where we could store / update the sts session created with credentials (local ones or from assumeRoles) instead of creating new session each time a function requiring one kicks in ?
***

**brikis98** commented *Nov 23, 2017*

Well, you could probably cache it in the `TerragruntOptions` struct, but I worry that with concurrency (e.g., during `xxx-all` operations), that may lead to problems. Do you have code that calls `get_aws_account_id()` so many times this causes a performance concern? If not, I'd avoid premature optimization.
***

**ebarault** commented *Nov 23, 2017*

hmmm, nope i was just asking just in case you'd have one, but we can easily 
- create a new session from local credentials
- get the iam role credentials
- create a new session from iam role credentials
- resolve account from this session

**brikis98** commented *Nov 23, 2017*

Actually, this method will take care of all of that for you: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/4bcec5557da0ced56a61e53698cb92a72f2fd5a8/aws_helper/config.go#L16. You probably just need to update `getAWSAccountID` to use it.
***

**ebarault** commented *Nov 23, 2017*

ah ah, yes :-) 
i was doing just the same thing but with `aws_helper.AssumeIamRole()`
still it might be a good option as this function's signature is much easier to feed !
let me finish this attempt and show you

Fixed by #382. Thanks @ebarault!

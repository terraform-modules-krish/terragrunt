# Question: Use terragrunt with other providers (Vmware/google...)

**goseeped** commented *May 21, 2018*

Can we use vmware/vcenter, opennevula or google clould  providers with terragrunt?

If that's the case how? where to place providers info? 

I failed to find information or code example! 

Thanks in advance

Yup, sure. The `provider` always go into your Terraform code (`.tf`) files, so Terragrunt doesn't need to know about it. Terragrunt has some extra behavior built in for the [S3 backend](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/s3.html), but other backends will work fine too.

Thanks for your quick response, 

So it is still possible to use the advantage of S3 backend for the state and lock and at the same time deploy on Vmware/google? there is not theoretical clash there? 

Thanks,

Your choice of `backend` and the `provider(s)` you use for resources are independent decisions. The most common thing is to use the same cloud for both (e.g., [S3 + AWS](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/s3.html), or [GCS + GCP](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/gcs.html)), but you can mix and match if you wish.

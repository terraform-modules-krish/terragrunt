# Support assigning terragrunt output to shell variables

**bryanneva** commented *Nov 22, 2021*

When using `terragrunt output` in a shell script to assign a variable, if the cache is empty, then the the variable assignment will be empty. To mitigate this, my team runs `terragrunt output` twice, once before assigning to a variable, and the second to assign the variable. 

For instance, this happens to my team most commonly in our CI environment in post-terragrunt steps, such as reading an IP address from output. 

When a job fails because of an empty cache value, the error is subtle and confusing. When you try to reproduce it, running `terragrunt output` typically works because either: (1) the cache has already been established from the first time it ran, or (2) you're testing it locally which likely already established a cache.

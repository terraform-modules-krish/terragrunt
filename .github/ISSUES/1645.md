# use secrets from aws secret manager

**suppix** commented *Apr 18, 2021*

Could you please help me how can I use secret variables from aws secret manager in terragrunt ? 

With terraform I use such approach: 

variables.tf
```
data "aws_secretsmanager_secret_version" "creds" {
  secret_id = "app-prod-config-server"
}

locals {
  app-creds = jsondecode (
    data.aws_secretsmanager_secret_version.creds.secret_string
  )
}
```
Then I can use secret variables in my tf files. 
```
username                   = local.app-creds.DATASOURCE_USERNAME
password                   = local.app-creds.DATASOURCE_PASSWORD
```

The best way would be to use [run_cmd](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/built-in-functions/#run_cmd) with the AWS CLI:

```
locals {
  app_creds = jsondecode(run_cmd("aws", "secretsmanager", "get-secret-value", "--secret-id", "app-prod-config-server", "--region", "us-east-1"))
}
```

Note that we are most likely not going to offer first class support for this in terragrunt to avoid bloating the API.

# Terragrunt not calling init automatically to download providers

**brikis98** commented *Mar 20, 2018*

Terragrunt currently calls `init` automatically when:

1. You have a `module` in your code, but no `.terraform/modules` folder.
1. Your remote state configuration differs from the local `.tfstate` file.

[Terraform 0.10](https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/0-10.html) requires a third case when you must run `init`:

3. To download providers. This applies to just about _all_ Terraform code, so probably the easiest is just to check if the `.terraform` folder existed. 

We never noticed this check was missing because most of our code uses either `modules` or remote state, but if you have simple code with neither one, the auto init fails.

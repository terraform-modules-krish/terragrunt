# Latest alpine/terragrunt image is using Terraform v0.11.15

I see a new tag for 0.11.15 was pushed up a few minutes ago, but I think it was a mistake to tag it as the latest?

```
‚ùØ docker run --rm -it alpine/terragrunt:latest terraform version
Terraform v0.11.15

Your version of Terraform is out of date! The latest version
is 0.15.1. You can update by downloading from www.terraform.io/downloads.html

Or was `0.11.15` a typo for `0.15.1` since that was released yesterday? ü§î

Agh so sorry for the noise! Didn't realize y'all don't really manage that build. The correct repo is https://github.com/alpine-docker/terragrunt. For posterity though this was because Terraform had a [v0.11.15 release](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/releases/tag/v0.11.15) too. (didn't even realize that's still maintained!)

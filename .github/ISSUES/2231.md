# before hook to start a proxy connection

**jw-websensa** commented *Aug 10, 2022*

I want to deploy resources to kubernetes using terragrunt.
However my cluster is in VPC without public access, so I am using jumphost to get to it.
I wanted to add `before_hook` to establish connection to my proxy (SSH port forwarding),
but even though I pass `-f` option to `ssh` command (should be run in background), terragrunt gets stuck on hook execution.
Is there any workaround?

Hi,
AFAIK each hook execution is blocking, so it will not be possible to establish background connection to bastin

# Incomplete Release Assets for v0.35.17

**wpp** commented *Jan 12, 2022*

Hi and thanks for providing this tool and new releases!

But I'm wondering if the assets for [v0.35.17](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.35.17) might be incomplete? It seems like only the Source Code archives are currently available.
Feel free to close this issue if the rest is coming.

Cheers

Hello, +1 on adding the rest of the assets to the `v0.35.17` release - this is currently failing our pipeline as we download the latest version of terragrunt from the github releases.

this seems to happen frequently...or at least I've seen it happen multiple times. Typically the binary assets lag the zip by a few minutes...I've never seen it take this long.

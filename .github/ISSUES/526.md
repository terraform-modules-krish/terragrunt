# Remote state key

**lambertpan** commented *Jul 18, 2018*

I have configured remote state key path in root `terrafrom.tfvars` (key     = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate") . This works perfectly, I get key paths as 

-  dev/us-east-1/vpc/terraform.tfstate
-  dev/us-east-1/iam/terraform.tfstate

However, I hard coded these paths in `account.tfvars` to use the remote state of modules - something like below;
vpc_remote_state_key = "dev/us-east-1/vpc/terraform.tfstate"
iam_remote_state_key = "dev/us-east-1/iam/terraform.tfstate"

and used these variables in modules to get the values using (data "terraform_remote_state").

My question is about the values which I passed to `vpc_remote_state_key`, `iam_remote_state_key`. Is there a way or method which can get rid of the hard coded value?? - something like below 
vpc_remote_state_key = "{path()}/vpc/terraform.tfstate"
iam_remote_state_key = "{path()}/iam/terraform.tfstate"

What about this? 

`vpc_remote_state_key = "${var.env}/${var.region}/${var.service}/terraform.tfstate"`

You can achieve this by having an env.tfvars on dev/ level with:
`env="dev"`

and a region.tfvars on dev/us-east-1 level
`region="us-east-1"`

You can even get further and add a service.tfvars on dev/us-east-1/vpc level
`service="vpc"`

On root terraform.tfvars though you will have to include:
`terraform {
    optional_var_files = [
        "${get_tfvars_dir()}/${find_in_parent_folders("env.tfvars", "ignore")}",
        "${get_tfvars_dir()}/${find_in_parent_folders("region.tfvars", "ignore")}",
        "${get_tfvars_dir()}/${find_in_parent_folders("service.tfvars", "ignore")}",
      ]
}
`

Thats how I do it but I would love to get feedback.

Won't this increase the additional maintenance? and could go against DRY?
Do we have something similar to ${path_relative_to_include()}? but just returns the header path to module, something as `${path_relative_to_include_header()}`, and provides `dev/us-east-1`, in that case It can be used in the arguments? right?
```
arguments = [
        "-var",
        "vpc_remote_state_key=${path_relative_to_include_header()}/vpc/terraform.tfstate"
```

@brikis98 any thought on this?

I'm not aware of a way to make that much more DRY currently.

I am in the same situation.
My terragrunt.hcl fil saves my state in a GCP bucket gs://infrastructure/network/shared-vpc.
But i do not really know how i would go about to use `terraform_remote_state` to access outputs in a parent directory (gs://infrastructure/network).

Did you find any solution @lambertpan ?

One idea: as of [v0.19.4](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.19.4), Terragrunt supports all Terraform built-in functions. Perhaps you can figure out a way to use those to do what you want? See also https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/303#issuecomment-510309532 for interesting ways these functions can be combined.

@brikis98 
Thanks a million! I just put this in my terragrunt.hcl file in order to find the parent state file in my bucket.

```
inputs = {
  bucket_parent_path = "${path_relative_to_include()}/${dirname(find_in_parent_folders())}"
}
```

Closing as it looks like the question has been answered. Please open a new issue if there is a follow up or the question is unsolved. Thanks!

# Apply-all confirmation list includes ignored modules

**josh-padnick** commented *Dec 19, 2016*

When you run `terragrunt apply-all`, Terragrunt will first ask you if you want to apply each external dependency. Whether you say yes or no, it includes the external dependency in the list above "Are you sure you want to run 'terragrunt apply' in each folder of the stack described above?"

The expected behavior is external modules that are not to be applied should be omitted from the list.

[terragrunt]  Module /repos/gruntwork-clients/acme/infrastructure-live/stage/vpc depends on module /repos/gruntwork-clients/acme/infrastructure-live/mgmt/vpc, which is an external dependency outside of the current working directory.

BTW, if I have time later this week, I'll fix some of these issues directly.

Ah, yea, I'm guessing your answer is recorded, but when rendering that Stack object, the answer is not taken into account. That's probably an easy fix.

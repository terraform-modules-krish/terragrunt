# Bug in --terragrunt-strict-include?

**brikis98** commented *Jun 23, 2021*

I created the following folder structure for testing:

```
.
├── bar
│   └── D
│       ├── main.tf
│       └── terragrunt.hcl
└── foo
    ├── A
    │   ├── main.tf
    │   └── terragrunt.hcl
    ├── B
    │   ├── main.tf
    │   └── terragrunt.hcl
    └── C
        ├── main.tf
        └── terragrunt.hcl
```

Each of the `main.tf` files has just a single output variable for testing. E.g., `D/bar/main.tf` is:

```hcl
output "text" {
  value = "D/bar"
}
```

All the `terragrunt.hcl` files are empty, except `foo/A/terragrunt.hcl`, which contains:

```hcl
dependencies {
  paths = ["../B", "../../bar/D"]
}
```

I run the following:

```bash
cd foo
terragrunt run-all apply --terragrunt-include . --terragrunt-strict-include
```

Due to `--terragrunt-strict-include`, I expected it to _only_ run `apply` on the modules in the `foo` folder, but it immediately prompts me as follows:

```
Module /tmp/tginvestigation/live/foo/A depends on module /tmp/tginvestigation/live/bar/D, which is an external dependency outside of the current working directory. Should Terragrunt run this external dependency? Warning, if you say 'yes', Terragrunt will make changes in /tmp/tginvestigation/live/bar/D as well! (y/n)
```

Why is it still looking into the `bar` folder?

I have a similar problem discussed in #1605 I spent some time stepping through the code a while back to try and understand the behaviour around some of the exclude/include flags.

If it's helpful for others, I'm finding the following workaround useful, and I believe it covers what you're trying to achieve in the issue described.

```
terragrunt run-all apply \
-auto-approve \
--terragrunt-strict-include \
--terragrunt-include-dir "$(pwd)/*" \
--terragrunt-ignore-external-dependencies
```

I agree that the behaviour of `--terragrunt-strict-include` and `--terragrunt-ignore-external-dependencies` could use some more investigation.

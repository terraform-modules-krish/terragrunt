# Logging output during terragrunt output makes some scripting difficult

**jmahowald** commented *Sep 10, 2017*

in the past, I'd have a command like

` ecs-cli compose service up --cluster  $(terraform output cluster_name)`

This doesn't work as well with terragrunt, as the actual stdout of that command is


``
 echo $cluster_name
[0m[1mCopying configuration[0m from "file:///Users/josh/workspace/backpackhealth/backpackinfra"...[0m [0m[1mTerraform initialized in an empty directory![0m The directory has no Terraform configuration files. You may begin working with Terraform immediately by creating Terraform configuration files.[0m dev-green-ecs
``

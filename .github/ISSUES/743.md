# Will there be continuing support for 0.18.x?

**cscheib** commented *Jun 12, 2019*

Will there be continuing support/releases for the 0.18.x version, since there are breaking changes on both the terragrunt and terraform (with .12) sides?

relevant to maintaining a Homebrew version of the tool:

No, probably not. We may do some sort of hotfix for security issues, but other than that, there will be no additional support for Terraform 0.11.x. We're doing our best to keep up with the work for one version of Terraform, and unfortunately, I just don't think we'd be able to handle more than that!

But actually, what does really make the new terragrunt incompatible with terraform 0.11?
There are new configuration files `terragrunt.hcl`, ok, but it has nothing to do with terraform itself.

I installed terraform 0.11 into a separate directory, converted `terraform.tfvars` into `terragrunt.hcl`   and hacked the `PATH`:
```
$PATH=~/bin/terraformv11:$PATH terragrunt plan
```
It worked!

For some reason `--terragrunt-tfpath` fails with
```
terragrunt --terragrunt-tfpath=~/bin/terraformv11/terraform plan
Incorrect Usage. flag provided but not defined: -terragrunt-tfpath
```
Anyway, can we set the terraform path in `terragrunt.hcl` instead? It would:
1. Allow using 0.12 in parent `terragrunt.hcl`
2. Allow overriding the version to 0.11 in a module `terragrunt.hcl`

So we'll be able to have a mix of modules for 0.11/0.12.

The differences from 0.11 weren't huge:

1. We're passing the `inputs = { ... }` block as environment variables, converting them to JSON first. Not positive this works as expected with Terraform 0.11.
1. We had to change a bit how we check backend configuration equality. I _think_ it may still work with 0.11, but am not sure.
1. The most important one, and why I set the version constraint to `>= 0.12.0`: we're no longer testing with Terraform 0.11, only Terraform 0.12. So even if it works now, it may well break later, and I'm not a fan of having to develop and test against multiple versions.

The unfortunate reality is that Terraform is not a 1.x tool, so there's no promise of backwards compatibility; the same is true of anything that works with Terraform, including Terragrunt.

Yes, I forgot to mention that I removed the version constrain from terragrunt before it worked :)

Well, I'm still keen on making a PR that will allow overriding the terraform binary path in `terragrunt.hcl`. The change doesn't seem huge to me.

It's just a no-go for the upgrade at the moment, because we can't just upgrade **all** modules we have to `0.12` at once. @brikis98 How do you think?

Also, is it possible to generate a `terragrunt_auto.tfvars` with the variables from `input` instead of converting them to env vars? The file will be automatically included by terraform in that case, and it should work better with complex types https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/738

I agree with @ekini. It's not exactly feasible to upgrade **all** modules at once, especially if there are considerable changes required.

Just to put it out there, one option is to dual boot terragrunt using a method very similar to [this post](https://blog.gruntwork.io/installing-multiple-versions-of-terraform-with-homebrew-899f6d124ff9). Note that I agree it is not an ideal situation because you also have to dual boot terraform and so there is a lot of switching involved, but it is at least a workaround (meaning, partial upgrade is not entirely impossible).

**ekini** commented *Jun 25, 2019*

That's really **a lot** of switching :) Another universal workaround for those who use [direnv](https://direnv.net/) is to download old terragrunt/terraform into separate folders and put the following into `.envrc`
```
export PATH=~/bin/terragrunt-0.18:~/bin/terraformv11:$PATH
```
The main downside is that it will require a lot of files like this in every module that requires a specific version, and any developer will have to install/configure direnv.

Closing as stale, and since OP, there have been additional features to support older terraform versions (namely [terraform_binary](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#terraform_binary)). If this is still a concern, please open a new issue. Thanks!

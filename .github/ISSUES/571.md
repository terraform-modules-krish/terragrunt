# Terragrunt cache folder still contains deleted files in source folder

**Sprinkle** commented *Sep 17, 2018*

When using terragrunt, we noticed that if we renamed a source file or deleted a source file, the working folder still contains the original file / deleted file in its worker folder.

It seems that the copy files operation performed by Terragrunt does not do a sync, but just copy modified or new files.

Hm, it should delete all `*.tf` files: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/cli/download_source.go#L322

Are you referring to other file types?

Oh yeah, we have some .yaml files and some template files being referenced in our .tf files.

Can we make it configurable such that it will sync all files against the working folder?

PRs for improving how Terragrunt does copying are welcome. There are several requests around this functionality:

1. Clean up all files/folders, not just `.tf`.
1. Copy _some_ hidden files and folders, but not all (e.g., not `.git`). See https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/394.

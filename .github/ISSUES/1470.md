# [Question] - How to use -detailed-exitcode with terragrunt plan

**SurdTechnologies** commented *Dec 24, 2020*

https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/plan.html has a 
-detailed-exitcode - Return a detailed exit code when the command exits. When provided, this argument changes the exit codes and their meanings to provide more granular information about what the resulting plan contains:

0 = Succeeded with empty diff (no changes)
1 = Error
2 = Succeeded with non-empty diff (changes present)

When I try to use terragrunt plan -detailed-exitcode I am getting error and my script is not proceeding.

`Running the command `terragrunt plan -detailed-exitcode` gives

```
Running command: terraform plan -detailed-exitcode
Hit multiple errors:
exit status 2
```

It seems the error is there only when plan detects there is a change. If there is no change ( exit status 0 ), the script doesn't stop/exit.
The workaround so far is to run terragrunt plan > out.txt ( without the -detailed-exitcode ) and then parse out.txt to see if any changes are there and take according action.

Unfortunately, we don't currently support this in terragrunt because we don't do any special parsing of the args for terraform, and thus are not intelligently handling the non-zero exit code for non-empty diff. The other issue is that terragrunt does not exit with the error code from terraform (this is due to the ambiguities introduced with using `xxx-all` commands).

To support this, we probably need to enhance the CLI parsing to handle `-detailed-exitcode`, taking care to throw a warning or error when using it with `xxx-all` commands.

Also, its possible to use terragrunt plan -out=<name>.tfstate followed by terragrunt show -json <name>.tfstate to get the plan changes as a json and use the json to decide further course of action for the new plan.

Terragrunt support for `-detailed-exitcode` would make Terragrunt a lot more usable in CI/CD pipelines like GitHub Actions where typically you don't want to generate the apply step if the plan step produces an empty plan.

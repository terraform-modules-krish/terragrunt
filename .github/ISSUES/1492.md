# Getting type issues when passing outputs between modules

**tluzon-digibank** commented *Jan 17, 2021*

I'm getting this:
Error: Iteration over non-iterable value

  on locals.tf line 3, in locals:
   2:   routes = flatten([
   3:     for table in var.private_route_table_ids : [
   4:       for route in var.route_cidr : {
   5:         table = table
   6:         route = route
   7:       }
   8:     ]
   9:   ])
    |----------------
    | var.private_route_table_ids is "[\"rtb-00xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\",\"rtb-06yyyyyyyyyyyyyyy\",\"rtb-01zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz\"]"

A value of type string cannot be used as the collection in a 'for' expression.

when var.private_route_table_ids is sent by dependency output.
it takes the list of strings and puts these backslashes which makes it a string.
this worked when using terraform_remote_state and pulling the outputs using TF.

Any way out of this?

Github removed the backslashes, anyhow there are backslashes before each inner quote sign

Could you put your code in a [fenced code block](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks#fenced-code-blocks) to make the code more readable, add syntax highlighting, and allow characters like backslashes?

I've just encountered a simpler example of the same issue;
I'm sending an input value which is a list of strings and TF gets it as a string because of the backslashes.
This is from the terragrunt.hcl file:
`inputs = {
  allowed_cidrs = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
}`

And this is the error I get:

```Error: Incorrect attribute value type

  on main.tf line 53, in resource "aws_security_group_rule" "rule":
  53:   cidr_blocks       = var.allowed_cidrs
    |----------------
    | var.allowed_cidrs is "[\"0.0.0.0/0\"]"

Inappropriate value for attribute "cidr_blocks": list of string required.
```

Do you have a type annotation (e.g., `type = list(string)`) in the terraform code for the variable (`allowed_cidrs`)? Unlike a `tfvars` file, terragrunt inputs are passed through via env vars using json encoding, and without the `type` annotation on terraform side, terraform defaults to parsing it as string.

I don't have a type set.
Sounds like this is the issue.
Thank you!

# Remote state backend S3 without logging and encryption enabled

**marlovil** commented *Nov 26, 2020*

When creating the remote stat backend S3 bucket, **encryption and logging are disabled**. There is no way to activate it using `terragrunt init` command.

Terraform version: 0.13.5
Terragrun version: 0.26.7

Configuration:
```
remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    profile        = "profile-1"
    bucket         = "project-terraform-tfstate"
    region         = "eu-west-1"
    encrypt        = true
    dynamodb_table = "project-terraform-lock"
    key            = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
  }
}
```
The AWS profile `profile-1` has Administrator access level.

The output is:

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

In your logs, I see:

```
[terragrunt] 2020/11/26 11:23:58 Create S3 bucket with retry project-terraform-tfstate returned an error: InvalidClientTokenId: The security token included in the request is invalid.

```

Some issue with how you're authenticating perhaps?

Hi @brikis98!

Tanks for your question. The profile we used to deploy the infra belongs to Administrator user group. The S3 bucket was created successfully. The only thing that doesn't work is enable versioning and encryption. We've finally enabled both options via console (with the same user). In fact, with the same user, we've deployed other S3 buckets enabling versioning and encryption without any problem.

Thanks!

Ah, if the same user is working now, then it may have been a timing issue, where the creds you were using just happened to expire on that first run. I believe "The security token included in the request is invalid" does show up for expired creds. Sounds like this is resolved, so marking as closed.

Hi!

Thanks @brikis98. But I don't think it was a temporary issue. I have been trying this several times during two different days. Only failed on the first time `terragrunt init` is executed. On the other side, it makes no sense that the init was able to create the bucket but not to enable logging and encryption.

Anyway, thanks for your support. If this issue happens again in another account/environment I will let you know.

//reopen

Not sure why this is closed with reason of permission issue? it is still open.  I have EC2 instance profile which has all admin access.


terragrunt creates remote state bucket without versioning and without encryption enabled where  as by default both should be done.

**_versions_**
terragrunt version v0.26.7
Terraform v0.13.5

**_config_**

remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    encrypt        = true
    bucket         = "${get_env("PROJECT_NAME", "")}-${get_env("FLAVOR", "")}-remotestate-${local.account_name}-${local.aws_region}"
    key            = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = local.aws_region
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
    s3_bucket_tags = {
      managedby     = "Terragrunt"
      env = "${get_env("PROJECT_NAME", "")}-${get_env("FLAVOR", "")}"
    }
    dynamodb_table_tags = {

Hi @brikis98.

Seems that  @nsvijay04b1 has the same problem. Could we reopen the issue, please? 

Thanks!

**nsvijay04b1** commented *Dec 9, 2020*

Apologies ..   Deleted the bucket and ran terragrunt again.  I see versioning enabled and  encryption enabled with default KMS key  (  AWS Key Management Service key (SSE-KMS))    .  Thanks.

My mistake to ask to reopen.  please, confirm if there is a way to ask for AES256 , the default S3 managed key for encryption than managing KMS master key.

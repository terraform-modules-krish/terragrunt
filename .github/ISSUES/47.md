# Error parsing Terragrunt config file .terragrunt: state_file_id cannot be empty

**mcraig88** commented *Nov 4, 2016*

Trying to set up terragrunt for the first time using this command:
terragrunt plan --var-file=..\terraform.tfvars -out .\plan.out -var "username=$env:username"

and I get:
Error parsing Terragrunt config file .terragrunt: state_file_id cannot be empty

.terragrunt file contents:
```
# Configure Terragrunt to use DynamoDB for locking
lock = {
	backend = "dynamodb"
	config {
		stateFileId = "my-apps"
		awsRegion = "us-west-2"
		tableName = "terragrunt_locks"
		maxLockRetries = 360
	}
}

# Configure Terragrunt to automatically store tfstate files in an S3 bucket
remoteState = {
  backend = "s3"
  backendConfigs = {
    encrypt = "true"
    bucket = "tfremotestate"
    key = "terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-west-2"
  }
}
```

There is an S3 bucket created, called tfremotestate, and I have full Admin rights.

In #33, we changed all config values to use snake_case, not CamelCase. Can you change `stateFileId` to `state_file_id` as well as the other values to match snake_case and see if that fixes your issue?

Thanks, I have updated as below:

# Configure Terragrunt to use DynamoDB for locking

lock = {
backend = "dynamodb"
config {
state_file_id = "my-apps"
aws_region = "us-west-2"
table_name = "terragrunt_locks"
max_lock_retries = 360
}
}

# Configure Terragrunt to automatically store tfstate files in an S3 bucket

remoteState = {
  backend = "s3"
  backendConfigs = {
    encrypt = "true"
    bucket = "tfremotestate"
    key = "terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-west-2"
  }
}

output:

However, remote state does not get created, does it matter that I have
state local in my folder? Should I uplode my current terraform.state to s3
and remove the local copy?

I'm guessing the issue is that your `.terraform/` folder contains a previous terraform state configuration, and terragrunt does not yet overwrite an existing terraform state configuration. You can solve this as follows:
1. Ideally, `terraform destroy` everything so you can start from a clean slate. If that's not possible manually upload your state to the S3 location. To be safe, ensure S3 bucket versioning is enabled, and consider taking one more backup.
2. Now `rm -Rf .terraform`
3. Now run `terragrunt apply` again.

I believe Terraform will keep a copy of your terraform state locally, even if you have remote state enabled. But if you're referring to your state configuration (which is local by default), then, yes, I believe that was the issue here.

Exactly what I just suggested so we're thinking in line with each other!

I uploaded state to S3, and removed the local copy. (It wants to do a full
create on everything)
I replaced the local state file, made a minor change, and ran terragrunt
plan/apply, but remote state file did not get updated.
I there any enhanced logging I can enable to further troubleshoot?

I'd be happy to do a screen share and walk through.

FYI, I was able to create remote state using the following command (note, I'm running on Windows 10, in Powershell)

terraform remote config -backend=s3 -backend-config="bucket=tfremotestate-gcotech" -backend-config="key=terraform-state-us-west-2-lab/terraform.tfstate" -backend-config="region=us-west-2"

Not sure why terragrunt didn't do this for me?

**brikis98** commented *Nov 8, 2016*

The most recent `.terragrunt` you posted is still using camelCase for the `remoteState` settings. It should be `remote_state`, `config` instead of `backendConfig`, etc. As mentioned above, and documented in the [Readme](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt#quick-start), all the config settings now use snake_case.

```
# Configure Terragrunt to use DynamoDB for locking
lock = {
    backend = "dynamodb"
    config {
        state_file_id = "my-apps"
        aws_region = "us-west-2"
        table_name = "terragrunt_locks"
        max_lock_retries = 360
    }
}

# Configure Terragrunt to automatically store tfstate files in an S3 bucket
remoteState = {
  backend = "s3"
  backendConfigs = {
    encrypt = "false"
    bucket = "tfremotestate"
    key = "terraform-state-us-west-2-lab/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-west-2"
  }
}


```

Your `remoteState` is still camelCase :) It should look more like this:

``` hcl
remote_state = {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    encrypt = "false"
    bucket = "tfremotestate"
    key = "terraform-state-us-west-2-lab/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-west-2"
  }
}
```

# Migrating to 0.13, initialization required ? 

**rgarrigue** commented *Jan 18, 2021*

Hi there

I guess the solution is trivial, but I don't get it : I'm trying to bump my stuff to 0.13. Hence ran the `terraform 0.13migration` command in my modules, which created `versions.tf`, commited tagged pushed, all good. But I got a bunch of `Initialization required` without further explanation. What am I missing ? Should I `terraform init` my modules and push the `.terraform` in git (which I .gitignore'd until now) ? Tried the latest terragrunt, `v0.27.1` just in case, no luck.

Here's a log example

When you bump terraform versions, a reinit is always required (calling `terraform init`) as the previous initialization is not compatible. However, terragrunt's auto-init is not smart enough to detect that you need to rerun init so it fails when working off of an existing initialization.

**Assuming you are using remote state**, the easiest way to resolve this is to wipe the terragrunt cache directories to force a reinit from terragrunt. Otherwise, you will need to rerun `terragrunt init` in each directory you have.

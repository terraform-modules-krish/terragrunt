# Receiving S3 backend credential error when using an AWS config assumed role profile

**ryno75** commented *Dec 3, 2018*

I receive the error:
`Error configuring the backend "s3": No valid credential sources found for AWS Provider.`
When attempting to run terragrunt using an AWS config assumed role profile.  The same exact terragrunt command works perfectly fine using a AWS config profile that is either using an IAM user (Access Key + Secret Key) or assumed credentials (Access Key + Secret Key + Token).

Here is a rundown...
```
> export AWS_PROFILE=aws.premium.staging
> export AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE=aws.premium.staging
> aws sts get-caller-identity

    "UserId": "AROAIYKNPLZYTEIM2JL46:botocore-session-1543851525",
    "Account": "##REDACTED##",

}

Please update the configuration in your Terraform files to fix this error.
If you'd like to update the configuration interactively without storing
the values in your configuration, run "terraform init".
```

However... I can use the same assumed role profile with terraform directly (or aws cli as show above) without issue.

Worth noting, this is what my AWS config profile looks like:
```
[profile aws.premium.staging]
region = us-west-2
role_arn = arn:aws:iam::##REDACTED##:role/OrganizationAccountAccessRole
source_profile = master_billing
```

Any profile that has credentials defined (in `~/.aws/credentials`) works just fine.

I have discovered a workaround that _may_ shed some light on the root cause.  If I set the `AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG` env var to a truthy value it uses the AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE and standard (i.e. non-golang) AWS config properties and works as expected using the assumed role profile.

Here's the interesting piece of the aws-sdk-go project that utilizes that var:
https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/blob/master/aws/session/env_config.go#L162

Not sure why this is a problem with terragrunt but I can execute terraform code just fine.  Perhaps the version of the aws-go-sdk in terragrunt is out of date?

**ryno75** commented *Dec 3, 2018*

Just forked terragrunt, updated the aws-go-sdk to the latest version, did a `go build` and am still seeing this error when running with that custom built bin.  This is likely a problem with how the terragrunt remote package is handling assumed roles?

Another workaround is to use the `--terragrunt-iam-role` CLI option, `TERRAGRUNT_IAM_ROLE` env var, or the `iam_role=` option in the `terragrunt{}` section of the terragrunt.tfvars file (as outlined here: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt#work-with-multiple-aws-accounts).  Using any of those methods to assume the desired role instead of using an AWS config assumed role profile works as desired.

Might have to do with how we configure the profile to use [here](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/9f07db38036dc4091d619a78537f30554ba3884b/aws_helper/config.go#L48), which is read from the [backend config](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/remote/remote_state_s3.go#L49), but does not seem to take env vars into account.

Hi, we're also seeing this issue, or one very similar.

We've done lots of trial and error, along with trying to understand the source code and what terragrunt is doing with regards to assuming roles.

We see the issue when we configure the remote state backend to have a different role in a separate account to the iam_role we configure within terragrunt {}.

state configuration
```HCL
terragrunt = {
  remote_state {
    backend = "s3"
    config {
      bucket  = "account1-bucket-name"
      key     = "josh-test-terragrunt-assume-issues"
      region  = "eu-west-1"
      encrypt = true
      role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::12345678901:role/account1Role"
    }
  }
}
```

terragrunt block
```HCL
terragrunt = {
  terraform {
    source = "..."
  }

  iam_role = "arn:aws:iam::12345678902:role/account2Role"
}
```
I've split the above configuration for visual purposes. The same issue occurs whether including from parent or all in one file.

What we think is happening is during the assumeRoleIfNecessary [here](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/cli/cli_app.go#L233) / [here](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/cli/cli_app.go#L309)  the assume role is setting environment variables.

Due to the order of precedence with how the aws-sdk gets credentials, these are being used for the remote_state to then assume role further on within runTerragruntWithConfig when it prepares the init command [here](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/cli/cli_app.go#L340) / [here](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/cli/cli_app.go#L411)

Please note, we are Golang novices and haven't performed any code debugging, we've come to this conclusion from simply reading the code so may well be very wrong.

This issue does not occur when using provider blocks (static configuration in HCL) due to Terraform's order of precedence. 

Cheers,
Josh

@JoshiiSinfield I'm running into the same exact issue.  Thanks for your post/comment.  Did you ever find a workaround?

Hi @jonathanhle,

Not for terragrunt to perform the assume_role no. I was hoping to dive deep into the code but just not had chance.

instead we use a providers.tf with the terraform provider resources as was the pattern before terragrunt was able to assume role.

I do plan on having a go at working it out. I need to up my go skills first though!

Cheers,
Josh

@JoshiiSinfield 

I'm seeing the same failure mode.

@jonathanhle 

Here is what I've done to work around this. 

I was previously using a static provider.tf file with aliases to manage this. 

To make this more dynamic I added the following in a provider.tf file in each of my module 

```
provider "aws" {
  alias  = "alias1"
  region = "${var.a_region}"

  assume_role {
    role_arn = "${var.assume_role_arn}:role/OrganizationAccountAccessRole"
  }
}
```
To each vars.tf 

```
variable "assume_role_arn" {
  description = "Role ARN used to assume the account."
}
variable "a_region" {
  description = "Region fight should be placed in"
}
```

I can then pass in the correct Role ARN to utilize via any of the methods Terraform provides (.tfvars, CLI, Env Variables).

Hi @brikis98 
Did you get a chance to review this at all? 

Unfortunately I've not had chance to dive in and try to fix it yet. I'm keen to hear any ideas/comments you have before I do.

Cheers,
Josh

@JoshiiSinfield Other than what I wrote in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/616#issuecomment-444185765, no, I haven't had a chance to dig in deeper

# apply-all should summarize any errors at the end of its run.

When you run `apply-all` on multiple modules, it's not obvious whether any modules had an error because Terragrunt itself won't exit with an error. Instead, you have to just scroll up to look for red text. It'd be better if Terragrunt reported its errors in a summary at the end like this:

```
[terragrunt] 2016/12/19 14:38:49 Terragrunt spin-up completed:

   5 Modules applied successfully [green text]
   1 Module failed to apply [red text]

Failed Modules
- ecs-cluster: Error downloading modules: module ecs_cluster: not found, may need to be downloaded using 'terraform get'
```

I think the `spin-up` command does show you the list of errors that happened, if any did. However, it does not have a nice summary message. That would be a great addition.

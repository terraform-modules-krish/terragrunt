# terragrunt fails with JSON error in Mac M1 machine [version 0.37.1]

**sharath-sequoia** commented *Jun 1, 2022*

I am using terragrunt in M1 Mac, and the version 0.37.1 fails with below error when I run terragrunt init.
We use remote s3 backend for terraform state.
The error is as below:
 % terragrunt init            
ERRO[0011] json: cannot unmarshal string into Go struct field Statement.Statement.Resource of type []string 
ERRO[0011] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1 

It is not clear what exactly is the issue. The same terragrunt config works fine with older version of terragrunt (v0.36.12). I'll be happy to provide any other details needed.

Hi,
I think this may be same issue as: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/2109

Hi, I have Mac on Intel chip and is experiencing the same.

Same problem on intel mac mini. Problem is intermittent. Occurs also on `terragrunt plan` and `terragrunt apply`.

fwiw I see the same on x86_64 docker in linux 
```
terragrunt --version
terragrunt version v0.37.1
terraform --version
Terraform v1.2.2
on linux_amd64
```

```

```
This is for remote state that doesn't exist yet (i.e. the first run, and also for things that don't touch the state e.g. `terragrunt validate` . If I run these versions against state that does exist (created with terraform 1.0.9 and terragrunt 0.36.something) they run just fine.

regarding being the same as #2109 the user that this runs at has full privileges for the state bucket. I'm going to continue debugging...

ok the thing I don't understand having read the release notes that I can init with 0.36.12 _without_ setting `disable_bucket_update = true`

ok reading closer setting `disable_bucket_update = true` does resolve it for me however I don't understand what would be different about checking the bucket stuff for a state path that doesn't exist vs one that does?

I ran into this issue on an AWS t4g instance (ARM based Graviton2 processor). The suggested fix for adding disable_bucket_update = true worked for me. This happened after upgrading to Terragrunt 0.37.1, and 0.37.2 since I noticed that got released today.

This stacktrace is horrible :'( I am lucky I could find this issue through googling to fix the terragrunt upgrade.
In the future could we have a better log so we can actually find the root of the problem? The golang stacktrace failing in JSON parsing is hell, it should at least show the String that it failed to parse. 

The new requirement in IAM to have permission to use `s3:GetBucketPublicAccessBlock` breaks everything if you have restrictive policies.

This issue was resolved in #2113

# Error: Unsupported Terraform Core version

**mklatsky** commented *Mar 23, 2022*

Installed versions:
  terragrunt    v0.36.6
  terraform     v1.1.7

Have cloned the terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example. I populated my environment with the TG_BUCKET_PREFIX variable.

I switched into the ~/examples_tutorials/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example/non-prod/us-east-1/qa directory, and ran `terragrunt plan-all`. The initial run asked:

```
Remote state S3 bucket mytestterragrunt-example-terraform-state-non-prod-us-east-1 does not exist or you don't have 
permissions to access it. Would you like Terragrunt to create it? (y/n) 
Remote state S3 bucket mytestterragrunt-example-terraform-state-non-prod-us-east-1 does 
not exist or you don't have permissions to access it. Would you like Terragrunt to create it? (y/n)
```
The bucket is created, but I am then presented with a message:
```
Error: Unsupported Terraform Core version
│
│   on main.tf line 14, in terraform:
│   14:   required_version = "= 0.13.3"
│
│ This configuration does not support Terraform version 1.1.7. To proceed,
│ either choose another supported Terraform version or update this version
│ constraint. Version constraints are normally set for good reason, so
│ updating the constraint may lead to other errors or unexpected behavior.
```
According to the Terraform Version Compatibility Table, it would appear that this version of terragrunt should support versions 1.1.x.

Per documentation, I have cleared the cache (the .terragrunt-cache dirs), and added `terraform_version_constraint= ">=1.1.7"` to the toplevel terragrunt.hcl file, but the error persists.

Any advice would be most welcome.

Hi,
I think should be updated reference to `terragrunt-infrastructure-modules-example` to the last release - [`ref=v0.7.0`](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-modules-example/releases/tag/v0.7.0), also not sure if it will work with 1.1.7 - since in included modules specify [`= 1.1.4`](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-modules-example/blob/master/asg-elb-service/main.tf#L14), prerequisites also references [`1.1.4`](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example#pre-requisites)

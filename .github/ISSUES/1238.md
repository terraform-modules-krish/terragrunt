# find_in_parent_folders documentation and tfvars files

**fitzoh** commented *Jun 27, 2020*

The [find_in_parent_folders documentation](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/built-in-functions/#find_in_parent_folders) has an example that implies terragrunt configuration can be read from `tfvars` files.

This seems to be the only reference to reading from non-hcl files, and is not explained.

Is this an error in the documentation, or is there a way to store terragrunt configuration in `tfvars` files?

Good catch! This is an error in the docs. Terragrunt 0.18 and older used `tfvars` files for its configuration, but with terraform 0.12 we had to update to using hcl files since `tfvars` files no longer allowed extra variables to be defined.

Fixed this in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1239

# Auto-init is not working

**GauntletWizard** commented *Oct 30, 2019*

In one of my repos, I recently added a new submodule to an existing module. Since then, `plan-all` no longer works for these directories. It appears that terragrunt is not detecting and running `terraform init`. After running `terraform init` in each of these directories, subsequent `plan-all` tasks work.

Are you using any of the following in the terragrunt `source`?

- Local references (e.g `source = ../module`)
- Remote references with no ref tag
- Remote references with a ref tag that is a branch

In each of these cases, Auto Init is known to not work correctly. At a high level, the underlying mechanism is checking for changes in the source tag to decide when to run `init`.

Yes, `source = ../module` is in use. That makes sense. Are there any plans to remedy this, i.e. running `terraform get` before operations?

@yorinasub17, the cases you mentioned, in which Auto Init is **known** to not work (or even not 'always' work), is it worth documenting these on [Auto-Init](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/auto-init/) documentation please?

At the moment, that page only has a generic note like so, which is helpful, but not helpful enough:

> Note that there might be cases where terragrunt does not properly detect that terraform init needs be called. In this case, terraform would fail. Running terragrunt init again corrects this situation.

In case you agree, I've created https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1026 with this amendment to the documentation.

As a workaround when using local references (e.g source = ../module), delete the `modules.json` files before running apply:
- `find .  -wholename "*/.terraform/modules" -type d | xargs rm -r`

Check that this will not delete unexpected files before proceeding ;-)

As I [commented](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1026) in the PR, the issue seems to have already been resolved. Therefore, I close the question.

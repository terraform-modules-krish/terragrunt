# locals not imported from parent directories

**mosheavni** commented *Nov 4, 2021*

My terraform dir structure is like this:
```
├── dev
│   ├── env.hcl
│   └── us-east-2
│       ├── region.hcl
│       └── vpc
│           └── terragrunt.hcl
├── prod
│   ├── env.hcl
│   ├── eu-west-1
│   │   ├── region.hcl
│   │   └── vpc
│   │       └── terragrunt.hcl
│   └── us-east-1
│       ├── region.hcl
│       └── vpc
│           └── terragrunt.hcl
└── terragrunt.hcl

```
terragrunt.hcl in the root with the backend configuration, and on every directory there's a `hcl` file with a `locals` block that is relevant to the directory,
for example, on prod, there's this on `env.hcl`:
```
locals {
  aws_profile = "default"
  env_type    = "production"
}
```

On the `vpc` directory my `terragrunt.hcl` looks like this:
```
include "root" {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}
```

I want all the `.hcl` files in the parent directories to be loaded and merged, but it goes all the way up to the root `terragrunt.hcl` and then fails because there are a lot of missing `local` variables.
Execution:
```
→ tg init --terragrunt-log-level debug --terragrunt-debug

```

What can I do to load all local variables dynamically?
Thanks.

# Variables in function calls

**nilsdebruin** commented *Jan 21, 2022*

I am trying to resolve a certain directory path, is there a possibility to include a variable in a function call, like in the following example:

```
locals {
  # Automatically load environment-level variables
  environment_vars = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("env.hcl"))
  env = local.environment_vars.locals.environment

  region_vars = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("region.hcl"))
  region = local.region_vars.locals.aws_region

  name = "${find_in_parent_folders(${local.region})}/${local.env}}"

}
```

The name variable has a function which needs a local variable called region. Thanks in advance!

Hi, I was wondering why evaluation of `find_in_parent_folders` can't be persisted in a separated variable and then used in string template:

```
locals {
  # Automatically load environment-level variables
  environment_vars = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("env.hcl"))
  env = local.environment_vars.locals.environment

  region_vars = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("region.hcl"))
  region = local.region_vars.locals.aws_region

  region_path = find_in_parent_folders("${local.region}")
  name = "${local.region_path}/${local.env}"

  test = run_cmd("echo", "evaluated name: ", "${local.name}")

}

```
Output in [my test](https://github.com/denis256/terragrunt-tests/tree/master/vars-function-call/app) : 
```
evaluated name:  /tmp/terragrunt-tests/vars-function-call/us-east-1/env1
```

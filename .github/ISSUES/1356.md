# Feature request: Add a option to the generate block to enable skipping the generation of the file

**michelzanini** commented *Sep 17, 2020*

I have a use case where I have multiple modules that might use Kubernetes and Helm providers.

To avoid repeating the code for those providers, I have it generated on the parent `terragrunt.hcl` file like this:

```
generate "provider-kubernetes" {
  path      = "provider-kubernetes.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  contents  = <<EOF
provider "kubernetes" {
  ...
}
EOF
}

generate "provider-helm" {
  path      = "provider-helm.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  contents  = <<EOF
provider "helm" {
  kubernetes {
    ...
  }
}
EOF
}
```

Note: I used `...` here to hide the configuration I use for the providers, as it doesn't matter for the example in question.

However, the problem here is that some modules on sub-folders might not need the `helm` provider, and some do.

What I want is to be able to optionally generate the file depending a boolean flag. Right now I am doing it like this:


```
generate "provider-helm" {
  path      = "provider-helm.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  contents  = local.enable_helm_provider ? "" : <<EOF
...
EOF
}
```

The flag `local.enable_helm_provider` is a bool that is loaded from the child modules.
This solution works, but I still have a empty `provider-helm.tf` file generated.

It would be really nice if Terragrunt had a attribute to support skipping the file creation, such as this:


```
generate "provider-helm" {
  path      = "provider-helm.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  generate_if = local.enable_helm_provider
  contents  =  <<EOF
...
EOF
}
```

The file would only be generated when `generate_if` is `true`.

Maybe this is not hard to implement and would be beneficial for more developers?
Are there any other options I am not aware of?

Thanks.

This seems like a useful addition, and a PR to add this would be welcome!

Here is a potential workaround to this as well, assuming you will always generate the kubernetes provider. In that case, you can combine the two into one file and use [template directives](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/expressions.html#directives) to only generate the helm portion if enabled.

E.g.:

```
generate "provider-kubernetes" {
  path      = "provider-kubernetes.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  contents  = <<EOF
provider "kubernetes" {
  ...
}

%{ if local.enable_helm_provider }
provider "helm" {
  kubernetes {
    ...
  }
}
%{ endif }
EOF
}
```

That's a nice approach @yorinasub17 ... I think you could generalize it to handle all providers, so it's not dependent on the kubernetes provider...

```
generate "providers" {
  path      = "providers.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  contents  = <<EOF
%{ if local.enable_kubernetes_provider }
provider "kubernetes" {
  ...
}
%{ endif }

%{ if local.enable_helm_provider }
provider "helm" {
  kubernetes {
    ...
  }
}
%{ endif }
EOF
}
```

Thanks for the templating suggestion, I will try that for now as it's even better.
But, this approach still generate the files, it would be good to have a option that would avoid generation.

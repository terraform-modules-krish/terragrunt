# prei stall terragrunt with modules

**ErikEngerd** commented *Oct 7, 2020*

with terraform-bundle, terraform providers can be downloaded once and preinstalled so everyone uses the exact same versions. Also, it makes managing infrastructure independent of the terraform website being up.

Is this also possible with terragrunt? If so, how?

There's no native support for this with Terragrunt, and we haven't tried to use it with terraform-bundle, so I'm not sure. If anyone has a chance to try it out, let us know.

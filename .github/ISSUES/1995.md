# Is it possible to apply a module and all its Dependants ? 

**sherifabdlnaby** commented *Jan 23, 2022*

I am currently evaluating Terragrunt for my company and have a question.

When you `terragrunt run-all apply`  on a module `X` that is depending on module `A`, terragrunt will apply `A` -> `X`.

My question is whether there there is an option to do the **vice-versa**? I want to do some changes to `A`, and when I apply it, Terragrunt would figure out that module **`X`** (and possibly `Y`, `Z` ) all **depends on** **`A`**, and hence apply **`X`**, **`Y`**, and **`Z`** after applying **`A`**.

Possible Solutions/WorkArounds:
1. Print Out the Dependency Graph, and run Apply Manually at each Dependant.
2. Use `--terragrunt-include-dir "xxxxxx"` and use `run-all apply` ( will still need to evaluate the dependency graph myself and it is subject to human error. )

**The only solution I found is running `run-all apply` at the root of my project, but at our infrastructure size this will:**
 1. Takes a lot of time. 
 2. Will introduce friction between teammates when a drift is detected, although drift needs to be fixed sooner or later, it might be completely unrelated to the **current task** an engineer is applying.

Hello,
not sure if it is supported yet, currently Terragrunt can show a warning before destroy of `A` that it has dependent module `X`

@denis256 How easy is it to implement a "cascading apply"? If I changed something in my VPC, I need to make sure all dependants has been re-applied?

Hi, good question, it may require additional design since cascading apply may generate "ripple" effects on multiple modules

This duplicates #1509.

Coincidentally, they were posted exactly 1 year apart. Neat!

# Add reference docs for terragrunt specific commands

**yorinasub17** commented *Aug 21, 2020*

In the reference section of terragrunt.gruntwork.io, we should add a section that lists all the terragrunt commands:

- `apply-all`
- `plan-all` (including limitations: see below)
- `destroy-all`
- etc

This should also list the limitations of `plan-all`, as described in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/720#issuecomment-497888756 and https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1127#issuecomment-611353504

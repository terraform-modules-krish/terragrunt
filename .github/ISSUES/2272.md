# how to override iam_role in child terragrunt.hcl?

**dudicoco** commented *Sep 12, 2022*

Hi,

I've set the `iam_role` variable in the root `terragrunt.hcl`:
```hcl
iam_role = "arn:aws:iam::${local.common.account_id}:role/terragrunt"
```

I'm trying to clear the `iam_role` by overriding it in the child `terragrunt.hcl`, I've tried both `iam_role = null` and `iam_role = ""` without success.

Is there a way to clear the `iam_role` within the child `terragrunt.hcl`?
<br />

Hi,
with current available functionality not sure if `iam_role` can be cleared in HCL, however, definition can be extracted to a separated HCL file and included if needed

```
include "iam_role" {
  path = find_in_parent_folders("iam_role.hcl")
}
```

Thanks @denis256, i'm already using this exact same workaround.

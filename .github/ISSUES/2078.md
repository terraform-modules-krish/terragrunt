# passing a tfvars file from the cli that is starting with a dot it will result in file not found.

**Raffaello** commented *Apr 21, 2022*

This is related to this terraform issue that i reported here: 
https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/30903

# Terragrunt version

```
terragrunt version v0.36.7
```
 
 
 When using a tfvars file from the CLI input, for e.g.: `terragrunt plan -var-file=.myvars.tfvars`
 
it fails with the following error:
```
│ Error: Failed to read variables file
│ 
│ Given variables file .myvars.tfvars does not exist.

ERRO[0001] 1 error occurred:

	* exit status 1

```

This issue doesn't exists instead if using a file named `_myvars.tfvars`, e.g.: `terragrunt plan -var-file=_myvars.tfvars` this works properly.

----

I don't know why is happening, but it might be the case that the file on unix/linux is hidden and it is not found because escluded from the search?

I have done a simple quick start test with both Terraform alone and Terragrunt.

Terraform doesn't present this issue.

Terragrunt, even using just the initial quick-start file sample from the documentation.
if it is used passing a variable files, and the file exists, starting with a dot. It will report error: file not found.

it looks like terragrunt doesn't copy the `.myvars.tfvars` file in the cache directory, so consequently is not found. 

so basically the issue is:

Terragrunt doesn't copy files passed as var-file arguments that are starting with `.` (hidden) into `.terragrunt-cache` working directory.

Hi,
hidden files are skipped by default, however, files can be included through `include_in_copy`:

```
terraform {
  include_in_copy = [".myvars.tfvars"]
}
```

ok, thanks, that can be acceptable as a workaround, especially also if that file is missing will just be ignored.
So i think the issue can be closed.

----

Besides,
In this case it might nullify using `-var-file` from the CLI as if needs to be hardcoded can be directly passed there as argument too. but ok.

It is more that is deviating from terraform behaviour as Terraform is accepting that file, so if it is passed as a -var-file it could be forced to be copied?
Anyway.

closing the issue at the moment as it is by design in this way so it is ok as my use case also works.

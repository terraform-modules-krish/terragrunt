# JSON parsing to hcl broken after 0.32.6

**justicel** commented *Dec 16, 2021*

I looked through the changes on 0.32.6 and I believe it's the HCLwrite parsing being done that is likely too early in the process. It seems as though this breaks the use of `terragrunt.hcl.json` files with embedded functions in them.

The changeset is here: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/compare/v0.32.5...v0.32.6

Using a simple include statement with an included function call is enough to break the parser with the following error:

```
ERRO[0000] /data/etrs-infrastructure/terragrunt.hcl.json:1,1-2: Argument or block definition required; An argument or block definition is required here.
ERRO[0000] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1
```

The include statement in the 'child' json file is:

```
{
  "include": {
    "path": "${find_in_parent_folders()}"
  },
...
```

Removing that allows the parser to complete successfully.

Here is a sanitized version of the parent json:

```
{
  "remote_state": {
    "backend": "gcs",
    "generate": {
      "path": "backend.tf",
      "if_exists": "overwrite"
    },
    "config": {
      "project": "<my project name at google>,
      "location": "us",
      "bucket": "<my bucket name>",
      "prefix": "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
    }
  }
}
```

Let me know if you need any other details, but this definitely seems to be related to the 0.32.6 changes for hcl checking as far as I can tell. For now we're sticking with 0.32.5, but anything newer than that totally breaks.

@yorinasub17 Just wanted to check in and see if there was anything else you needed in regards to this bug report? It has totally broken .hcl.json post 0.32.6

@yorinasub17 Any update to be had with this? It means I can't upgrade to 0.32.6+ until this is fixed. Thanks!

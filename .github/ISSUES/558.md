# Allow configuration of lifecycle rules on automatic S3 remote state bucket

**skang0601** commented *Aug 31, 2018*

I'd like to be able to specify the lifecycle rule on the S3 bucket that Terragrunt automatically attempts to create if the specified S3 bucket in the remote state does not exist much like we can do for the resource tags.

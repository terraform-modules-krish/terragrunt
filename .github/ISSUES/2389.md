# Bug with terragrunt run-all init --terragrunt-non-interactive does not work

**vasu2809** commented *Dec 10, 2022*

Hi,

We have a use case where we want to pass y by default to the prompt to create the backend bucket - we have tried using the command 

terragrunt run-all init --terragrunt-non-interactive

But the above command gives a 409 error during initializing saying bucket already exists after its created and init isnt successful

We also tried to non-interactive commands like 

echo "Y" | terragrunt run-all init

echo "y" | terragrunt run-all init

echo "YES" | terragrunt run-all init

echo "yes" | terragrunt run-all init

But none of the work, they end up giving errors, but although the bucket does get created in all the above cases, the initialization fails with errors in all cases

For apply, we have used the same command echo "Y" | terragrunt run-all apply which is working perfectly fine for us for the prompt do you want to run terragrunt in all modules? (y/n)

But the same command does not work for creating the bucket

What we noticed is we get 2 prompts for creating buckets, and we are not sure if that is causing issues when we pass y through non-interactive mode

The request for 2 prompts looks like a bug and maybe this is why non-interactive mode isn't working either where non-interactive provides y for first bucket prompt and creates it, and again provides y for the second prompt too and throws error saying bucket already exists

I am not sure if this is a bug

Terragrunt version AMD - 46
terraform version - 1.3.6

Hi,
was attempted to run with `--auto-approve --terragrunt-non-interactive` ?

Hi,

No it does not work, returns the same 409 bucket exists error - I guess the issue is because of duplicate prompts for bucket creation coming up during run-all init

Here is the output after running it with the suggested option


**terragrunt run-all init --auto-approve --terragrunt-non-interactive**

Hi, I'm using this command:
`terragrunt run-all init -no-color -input=false --terragrunt-include-external-dependencies`

or you can use it also like that : 
`yes | terragrunt run-all init`

looks like you created bucket using terragrunt and now you are trying to create it again

# Terragrunt run-all destroy creates a plan that destroys parent resources prior to dependent resources

**kansberry-kr** commented *Feb 16, 2023*

When performing a run-all apply, Terragrunt creates "Groups" of modules that run together based on dependencies. I believe these are typically named "Group1", "Group2", etc. When performing a run-all with the destroy option, it appears to create the same groups in the same order, but the order should be reversed, or Terragrunt should simple run the groups from "GroupX" down to "Group1". In other words, the groups created are always for the apply and run from "root" to "leaf", but for the destroy logic must be reversed to run from "leaf" to "root". Destroy currently fails because the root items get deleted, leaving the leaf items orphaned.

It appears the work on issue 2445 has stalled. Wanting to make sure this is not lost. If progress is made on the PR associated with 2445 is closed soon, I will reclose this issue.

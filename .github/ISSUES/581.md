# Issues while running tests on Windows

**marcoreni** commented *Oct 1, 2018*

This issue is to keep track of the errors encountered while running tests on Windows

1. `Filename too long`
```

```
2. `Missing commands` (also happens with `touch` and `cp`)
```

Thx for reporting. We unfortunately have not had time to set up CI on a Windows server, so these sorts of issues keep slipping in 😞

I have hit the first issue which is a result of the maximum character length in a windows shell and the new `.terragrunt-cache` location. The issue is the same as running earlier versions of npm on windows. The path that terragrunt copies module information into is too long for the windows shell.

This is somewhat non-deterministic as it depends on two things 

1. How deep in your files system you have the repo that contains your terragrunt files.
2. How many Terraform modules you pull in

As an example

The repo is cloned to
 
```
c:\repo\f1\f2\service-name
``` 

where f1 & f2 are some meaningful folder names
Our infra uses the following structure to follow a convention we have for remote state outputs.

```
service-name\infra\env\vpc\service-name\terraform.tfvars
```

This also pulls in a Terraform resource which also references another Terraform module.

When doing a plan, Terragrunt tries to copy artifacts to the `.terragrunt-cache` folder which adds what I presume is the hash of the files as the folder name. Eventually, it will exceed the maximum length of the windows shell as shown below

```

Folders have been renamed

### Work Arounds
* (Credit @lorengordon) export the env TERRAGRUNT_DOWNLOAD=C:\.terragrunt-cache in my shell/profile.
* I managed to move the service name folder to the root of my c drive; luckily the dir structure was able to be traversed.
* Use a terragrunt container wrapped in a ps function that would perform the terragrunts

This issue is likely to become more apparent, as was the case for npm, and the second workaround may not even work.

What's the proper fix? Is there some short version of file paths that Windows supports (with `~` characters substituting part of the path)? 
***

**lorengordon** commented *Feb 3, 2019*

Far as I know, there isn't much of a fix. I run into the same problem with a number of tools, even after turning on the [`LongPathsEnabled`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/fileio/naming-a-file#maximum-path-length-limitation) feature.

As a workaround for terragrunt, I export the env `TERRAGRUNT_DOWNLOAD=C:\.terragrunt-cache` in my shell/profile.

Another workaround is to use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

**brikis98** commented *Feb 3, 2019*

Hm, that's a shame. Thanks for sharing your workarounds, as hopefully they will help others!
***

**DefSol** commented *Feb 3, 2019*

@lorengordon that's elegant, I did not think of that. This mimics the previous behaviour of storing the cache in the temp directory. I have confirmed it works on my failing scenario. Thanks!

What I like the most is that it doesn't affect my flow!

I recommend @lorengordon approach be the primary option for solving (giving everyone the best chance to be the limits in windows) this issue.

**jakauppila** commented *Mar 14, 2019*

What would be the preference for CI on Windows? AppVeyor?
***

**brikis98** commented *Mar 14, 2019*

Yup, I think AppVeyor would work!

FYI, came across this issue on the Terraform repo: https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/21173

I'm struggling with #1299 and have a couple of questions.  Why does the terragrunt cache path need 73 characters?  Here's an example of the long paths I'm seeing post TF 13.3 upgrade:

C:\src\vsts\myInstance\aProject\myTerraForm\experiments\UNIT\b6446abb\.terragrunt-cache\LXqET6pD6BEswcFIg1rsjPV8ly4\0xE514VLijAM3D_w8dtQ73Wvxys\.terraform\plugins\registry.terraform.io\hashicorp\azuread\1.0.0\windows_amd64\terraform-provider-azuread_v1.0.0_x5.exe (264 characters)

Until TF fixes the path limitation, would be possible to s/.terragrunt-cache/.tg/? (saves 14 characters)

Are the two random 27 character strings needed for the nested sub-directories? On my machine, the first directory is empty so is it really needed?

***

**Ettery** commented *Nov 19, 2020*

While I find the Windows limitation frustrating, I agree with @ignatz42: is it necessary for terragrunt to add 74 chars to the path?  (In my case .terragrunt-cache\\-mwm0HJC1e8KJeyVKPJWYz94uN4\\vQcOrMLBOtnMKIDMdOcs90oHoiA).  The first folder always seems to be empty and even without the Windows issue it makes for a lot of folder navigation when debugging.

A ton of "filename too long" terragrunt errors point to this thread, which is how I ended up here. Most of the others are all locked.

I started running into problems when I started using private external modules with terragrunt, which just balooned my filepaths out. `mkdir` is the command that failed, on the aws provider creation from terraform.

`The filename or extension is too long.`

the TERRAGRUNT_DOWNLOAD fix did not solve it. The win32 long path policy/regex did not solve it. using powershell did not solve it.

In the end I switched to Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and ran my windows terragrunt/terraform commands there (added soft links to them in `~/bin`), which did not have a problem with the long filenames. A co-worker tipped me off that from VSCode you can run a WSL terminal using the `Remote Development` extension from Microsoft, which is rather nice.

I'm putting this solution here in case more people come here looking for win10 long filename error fixes.

This is clearly still an open issue... even using latest version 0.29.0.  Tried changing the terragrunt downlload location and long paths are enabled.  Frustrating as I've got everything working under Windows except terragrunt.  I wanted to avoid the WSL but it's not looking possible.
***

**ignatz42** commented *Apr 30, 2021*

@jonmelia I was able to work around the limit by setting two environment variables like this:

```
$env:TF_DATA_DIR = ".\.tf\"
$env:TERRAGRUNT_DOWNLOAD = ".\.tg\"
```

which reduced the path lengths by 21 characters and allowed me to just squeak by.  I maintain that having the ability to control the length of the randomly generated paths in some way would be a better long term option but I hope this helps in the meantime.

That seems to be allowing me to work for now.  I hadn't changed the TF_DATA_DIR previously..

I just ran across this stack overflow post on how to construct filepaths on windows to support long path names... https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36219317/pathname-too-long-to-open/36237176

My head is sore from trying to solve this problem on Windows.

Using TF 1.0.0 and TF 0.31.0

- Changed Registry to enable longpaths and computer policy to allow it.
- Using WSL and Ubuntu

Most of our TG paths work, but there are occasions where one is a little too long and I get stuck. 

I have spent weeks working through one specific module (have to rename it shorter, then rename it longer). This is because most of my team members are using MACs and I am one of the few Windows people. 

Is there a definitve guide to working around longpaths? (and switching to a MAC would be the last thing I want to do)

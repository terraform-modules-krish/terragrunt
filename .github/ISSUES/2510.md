# Terragrunt does not override dependency blocks following _envcommon pattern

**iangrunt** commented *Apr 1, 2023*

I have this block in my `_envcommon` for `eks-core-services` 

```
dependency "aurora" {
  config_path = "${get_terragrunt_dir()}/../../data-stores/aurora"

  mock_outputs = {
    primary_endpoint = "database"
    port             = 5432
  }
  mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands = ["validate", ]
}
```

I need to override this in my `eks-core-services/terragrunt.hcl` to point to a different location in my Reference Architecture, `config_path = "${get_terragrunt_dir()}/../../data-stores/aurora-legacy"`:

```
terraform {
  source = "${include.envcommon.locals.source_base_url}?ref=v0.91.0"
}

dependency "aurora" {
  config_path = "${get_terragrunt_dir()}/../../data-stores/aurora-legacy"

  mock_outputs = {
    primary_endpoint = "database"
    port             = 5432
  }
  mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands = ["validate", ]
}

# Include the root `terragrunt.hcl` configuration, which has settings common across all environments & components.
include "root" {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

# Include the component configuration, which has settings that are common for the component across all environments
include "envcommon" {
  path = "${dirname(find_in_parent_folders())}/_envcommon/services/eks-core-services.hcl"
  # We want to reference the variables from the included config in this configuration, so we expose it.
  expose = true
}
```

However, this configuration does not work, and Terragrunt still searches for the original dependency.

hit the same issue, the only way to override the dependency path is to use merge strategy = "deep" but then I get a lot of stuff that I don't want to get ...

# terragrunt not copying doted files (.something) from working dir in temp dir

**ebarault** commented *Dec 11, 2017*

this happens during stage labelled as
```
Copying files from my/workdir into /Users/ebarault/.terragrunt/qpryAuEVuRxDI-1s0Hw-004ArQc/WTycM2xCvnoeoxRFsIteSUwW1Zk
```

In `my/workdir` i have dotet files such `.config`, `.env` that are essential to my terraform task.

but when investigating after errors I noted that these files are not copied by terragrunt in the tmp dir `Users/ebarault/.terragrunt/qpryAuEVuRxDI-1s0Hw-004ArQc/WTycM2xCvnoeoxRFsIteSUwW1Zk`

is there a rational for this, or is this a bug?

i'm running terragrunt v0.13.23

Terragrunt intentionally skips hidden files and folders: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/236. Ideas on how to include them, while still skipping "problematic" ones (e.g., `.terraform`, `.git`, etc) are welcome!

**ebarault** commented *Dec 11, 2017*

ah ah, the wonderful side effect ! This is deceptive.
this means one cannot trust the copy step as a carbon copy, so I should always pass the absolute path of any included src/assets/whatever ressources to my module.

on how to improve this : why not maintaining a black list of unwanted files instead of running a whitelist excluding all hidden files/folders ?

Unintended consequences :)

Right now, Terragrunt doesn't copy any hidden files or folders. I'd be fine with either a blacklist or whitelist approach, so long as you could configure it. Example:

```hcl
terragrunt = {
  terraform {
    source = "..."
    exclude_from_copy = [".terraform", ".git"]
  }
}
```

Maybe some kind of .ebaraultignore ? :trollface:  ;-)

**ebarault** commented *Dec 11, 2017*

please forgive this funny colleague of mine ;-)
I'll try sparing some time soon to work on that one.

Method that copies files/folders: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/util/file.go#L136

Terragrunt config as it's parsed from file: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/config/config.go#L32

Terragrunt config as it's represented in memory after parsing: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/config/config.go#L20

It seems that Terragrunt copy just the `terraform.tfvars` and for the rest of the configuration files it uses `terrafrom init` to do that. So I think fixing this issue here well not be usefull unless terragrunt uses an other method to copy the configuration files.
Please check this [issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/3185) from info.

@cha7ri : ah good point, @brikis98 : is terragrunt using another type of copy mechanism ?
***

**brikis98** commented *Apr 9, 2018*

Terragrunt uses `init` to check out the code specified in `source` and then copies files over from the local folder using the code in this comment: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/394#issuecomment-350764413

Below I changed the function that copy the files and I added a debug message:

```func CopyFolderContents(source string, destination string) error {
	files, err := ioutil.ReadDir(source)
	if err != nil {
		return errors.WithStackTrace(err)
	}

	for _, file := range files {
		logger := CreateLogger("")
		logger.Printf("ch7ri copying %s", file.Name())
		src := filepath.Join(source, file.Name())
		dest := filepath.Join(destination, file.Name())

		if file.IsDir() {
			if err := os.MkdirAll(dest, file.Mode()); err != nil {
				return errors.WithStackTrace(err)
			}

			if err := CopyFolderContents(src, dest); err != nil {
				return err
			}
		} else {
			if err := CopyFile(src, dest); err != nil {
				return err
			}
		}
	}

	return nil
}
```

The only output that I have is this message: `ch7ri copying terraform.tfvars`
FYI:  the terraform.tfvars is not in the same folder as the configuration files. 
I run the test using `go run main.go plan`. I tried `--terragrunt-source-update` the same output.

What else do you have in the directory?

Using the new hooks feature to copy files that terragrunt does not has been working pretty well for me.

Could you share specifics? A workaround would be good to have on this issue.

Practical example of this limitation:

Let's say we're deploying an AWS Python Lambda. Let's say the lambda has a `.python-version` file to control the version across multiple touchpoints (local dev, CI, deployment, etc). Included in those touchpoints is the terraform resource that deploys the lambda.

AWS Lambda's terraform resource take an param `runtime` that specifies the Python version. I'd like to read the python version via `python_version = file("../.python-version")` inside a module that is referenced by Terragrunt. Seems like a straightforward thing to do!

`.python-version` isn't copied over into the Terragrunt cache. ðŸ¤¦ 

My goal is to have Python version specified once in the whole repo. 

Is this limitation documented anywhere?

A feature to specify files that should always be included is now available starting with https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.35.14

Example:

```hcl
terraform {
  source = "..."
  include_in_copy = [".python-version"]
}
```

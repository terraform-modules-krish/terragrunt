# `glide install` failure on case-insensitive file system

**ilovezfs** commented *Sep 21, 2017*

Due to
https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/issues/1539
https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/issues/1540

`glide install` fails with the following error:
```
Failed to set version on github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go to 00fb2125993965df739fa3398b03bef3eb2e198f: Unable to update checked out version
```

As a hack for https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/18363 I can manually clone the repository into GLIDE_HOME cache at the desired revision.

Full log is here: https://jenkins.brew.sh/job/Homebrew%20Core%20Pull%20Requests/9186/version=sierra/console

# Inputs to number variables with equality operator validation condition fails validation

**leptitchriss** commented *Feb 15, 2022*

Terraform variables (type number) with equality operator (==) in validation condition block fail when specified as an input in Terragrunt.

```
# module/variables.tf
variable "some_number" {
  default     = 3
  type        = number
  validation {
    condition = var.some_number == 3
    error_message = "Invalid number (expected 3)."
  }
}
```

Running the above (without overriding the default value) succeeds. However, if an override is specified via an input, eg:

```
# terragrunt.hcl

inputs = {
  some_number = 3
}
```

```
Error: Invalid value for variable
  on variables.tf line 203:
  203: variable "some_number" {

Invalid number (expected 3).

This was checked by the validation rule at variables.tf:206,3-13.
```

However, the other equality operators (>=, <=) seem to function correctly.

**As a workaround**, I am able to use combination of `alltrue` and `||`, however it makes it very tedious to validate for non-sequential numbers, eg:

```
variable "some_other_number" {
  default     = 3
  type        = number
  validation {
    condition = alltrue([
      (var.some_other_number >= 3),
      (var.some_other_number <= 3)
    ]) || alltrue([
      (var.some_other_number >= 5),
      (var.some_other_number <= 5)
    ])
    error_message = "You must specify a valid number (either 3 or 5)!"
  }
}
```

Using Terragrunt 0.36.0 and Terraform 1.1.5 (but I was also experiencing this in earlier versions as well).

So far, looks like an issue in Terraform with the identification of variable type from environment variables: 
```
$ TF_VAR_some_number=3 terraform apply
╷
│ Error: Invalid value for variable
│ 
│   on main.tf line 1:
│    1: variable "some_number" {
│ 
│ Invalid number (expected 3).
│ 
│ This was checked by the validation rule at main.tf:4,3-13.

```

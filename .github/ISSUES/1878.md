# Do not warn about double slash in URL for modules at root of registry module

**archenroot** commented *Oct 16, 2021*

Its bit pitty as terragrunt still complains about this:
WARN[0000] No double-slash (//) found in source URL /terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-cloud-storage.git. Relative paths in downloaded Terraform code may not work.

But my definition of the module is as following:
```
## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## COMMON TERRAGRUNT CONFIGURATION
## This is the common component configuration for mysql. The common variables for each environment to
## deploy mysql are defined here. This configuration will be merged into the environment configuration
## via an include block.
## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
## Terragrunt will copy the Terraform configurations specified by the source parameter, along with any files in the
## working directory, into a temporary folder, and execute your Terraform commands in that folder. If any environment
## needs to deploy a different module version, it should redefine this block with a different ref to override the
## deployed version.
terraform {
  source = "${local.source_source_url}?ref=v2.2.0"
}
#
## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Locals are named constants that are reusable within the configuration.
## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
locals {
  # Automatically load environment-level variables
  environment_vars = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("env.hcl"))

  # Extract out common variables for reuse
  env = local.environment_vars.locals.environment

  # Expose the base source URL so different versions of the module can be deployed in different environments. This will
  # be used to construct the terraform block in the child terragrunt configurations.

  source_source_url  = "git::git@github.com:terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-cloud-storage.git"
#  version = "2.2.0"

}
#
#
## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## MODULE PARAMETERS
## These are the variables we have to pass in to use the module. This defines the parameters that are common across all
## environments.
## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
inputs = {
  project_id = "auto-accountant"
  force_destroy = {
    "documents" = true
  }
  names = ["documents"]
  #  location   = "eu-central1"
  prefix = "prokyon-systems-auto-accountant"
  set_admin_roles = true
  admins = ["user:archenroot@gmail.com","user:michalpuda78@gmail.com","user:monika@kauli.cz"]
  versioning = {
    first = true
  }

  #  bucket_admins = {
  #    second = "user:spam@example.com,eggs@example.com"
  #  }
  # TODO: To avoid storing your DB password in the code, set it as the environment variable TF_VAR_master_password
}

```

Is this just an annoying warning or is it really creating a problem. This also should reflect the scope of the issue: should the warning simply be reduced or is some further mitigation needed?

Btw. this warning also occurs when using a source like this:
```hcl
terraform {
  source = "git@github.com:organization/terraform-module.git//?ref=1.0.0"
}
```
(Notice the double slashes that are in the source URL)

Interestingly these two source uri constructions do not issue warnings.  The post-`//` current directory `.` apparently satisfies terragrunt's remote vs path logic though it is worth noting that omitting this `.` _also works_ albeit noisily:

```
terraform {
  source = ".//."
}
```

```
terraform {
  source = "git::git@github.com:terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-project-factory.git//.?ref=v11.3.1"
}
```

Possible dupe of #1675 which has one solution here (use `//.`) - https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1675#issuecomment-862298365

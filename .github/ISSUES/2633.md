# Terragrunt Hangs Waiting for User Input in CI if the Remote State Backend S3 Bucket is Not Accessible

**X-Guardian** commented *Jul 7, 2023*

**Describe the bug**

When using an AWS S3 remote state backend and running Terragrunt within a non-interactive CI process, if the S3 bucket is not accessible for some reason (wrong credentials/permissions, doesn't exist yet etc) the Terragrunt process will hang waiting for user input that can never be given, with the message:

```
Remote state S3 bucket <BucketName> does not exist or you don't have permissions to access it. Would you like Terragrunt to create it? (y/n) 
```

**Expected behavior**

Terragrunt should either detect that it is running within a CI environment (normally env var `CI` is set) or have another CLI option to not prompt to create the bucket, but just fail.

**Versions**

- Terragrunt version: v0.46.1
- Terraform version: v1.4.6

Hi,
Terragrunt was running with `--terragrunt-non-interactive` or `disable_init` options?

HI @denis256, the documentation for that option says that it responds `yes` to any prompt, which is definitely not what we want in this scenario within a CI run.

Same problem here, we're currently running an atlantis pipeline, and the plan check just freezes because terragrunt still waits to press Y in the console.

hi @denis256, how are you doing? If we pass the --terragrunt-non-interactive flag, I get an error saying the bucket already exists, we previously have created the buckets in all AWS accounts.

Ran into something similar where in CI terragrunt would inconsistently prompt me when running destroy and hang, no combination of flags worked i.e `--terragrunt-non-interactive` or `--terragrunt-ignore-external-dependencies` even when set in environment variable format

```
Module /tmp/build/ee04e91f/terragrunt/clients/client/environments/dev/components/component depends on module /tmp/build/ee04e91f/terragrunt/client/bamboo/environments/dev/components/project, which is an external dependency outside of the current working directory. Should Terragrunt run this external dependency? Warning, if you say 'yes', Terragrunt will make changes in /tmp/build/ee04e91f/terragrunt/clients/client/environments/dev/components/project as well! (y/n) 
```


Ended up going with this hack 

```
echo "n" | terragrunt destroy . . .
```

I will look into

Added new CLI argument/environment variable in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.48.4

Thanks for this @denis256. I think the description for the new `terragrunt-fail-on-state-bucket-creation` argument is not quite right though. It is currently:

> When this flag is set, Terragrunt will wait for execution if it is required to create the remote state bucket.

Where it should be something like:

> When this flag is set, Terragrunt will fail and exit if it is required to create the remote state bucket.

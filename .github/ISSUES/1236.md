# Ability to run tool like summon to get env vars before terragrunt run

**ac-hibbert** commented *Jun 26, 2020*

I understand there is a ```before_hook``` command but I'm more looking to prepend something like ```summon``` to the actual terragrunt command

So to do the following for example:-

```summon -p summon-aws-secrets -f prod-secrets.yml terragrunt apply-all```

I'm not sure this is possible given that shell security prevents updating the parent process environment variables from a subprocess. However, one option is to specify how terragrunt calls terraform so that terragrunt wraps the terraform call with the various processes (e.g. `aws-vault` or `summon`). If someone can find an expressive and intuitive way to configure this, we can consider this feature for implementation.

I think the first step for this would be to propose a design as an RFC per our [contribution guideline](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/community/contributing/).

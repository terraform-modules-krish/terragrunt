# Escaping with $${} not working

**joao-teixeira-cvt** commented *Apr 26, 2021*

Hi all,

I have opened an issue on Terraform GitHub related with the fact I'm unable to escape a string on a JSON File using $${}. Please check the issue link: [](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28516#issue-867474078)

Alisdair from Terraform, reproduced the "issue" and he was able to run terraform with my configuration. And after testing, I was able to do so.
Which this may be related with Terragrunt and not Terraform.
I'm using the latest Terragrunt version v0.29.0 cause I'm using Terraform v0.15

Any clue?
<br />

Can you share your `terragrunt.hcl` configuration?

Also, can you link to the GitHub issue in the terraform project so I can get the background context? Thanks!

@yorinasub17 
I have the same problem. I had something like this in inputs block for generating YAML template with terraform.

```
variable "foo_credentials" {
  type = map(string)
}
```

```
foo_credentials =[{
    username = "$${my_user}"
    password = "$${my_password}"
}]
```

I got an error like this, which was very difficult to understand.

```
╷
│ Error: Variables not allowed
│ 
│   on <value for var.foo_credentials> line 1:
│   (source code not available)
│ 
│ Variables may not be used here.
╷
│ Error: Variables not allowed
│ 
│   on <value for var.foo_credentials> line 1:
│   (source code not available)
│ 
│ Variables may not be used here.
```

If you are the author of the terraform module, you can workaround by passing object as json encoded string.

```
variable "foo_credentials" {
  type = string
}
```

Terragrunt seems to be passing object as json internally (at least for now), so no change is required for terragrunt.hcl side, but if you want to make it clear that you are passing json, you can add `jsonencode` call.
```
foo_credentials =jsonencode([{
    username = "$${my_user}"
    password = "$${my_password}"
}])
```

I had the same problem when I used `file` function to pass script files to the terraform module. In this case single dollar is enough for causing the same error, such as `${foo}`.

The same for me. I'm trying to configure aws api gateway and can't use stage variables ( ex. `"https://${stageVariables.Host}/v1/{proxy}"`) because of this error. Escaping with `$$` is not working.
```
│ Error: Variables not allowed
│ 
│   on <value for var.methods> line 1:
│   (source code not available)
│ 
│ Variables may not be used here.

Same thing with `%`.

I am using [`gitlab_project_badge`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/gitlabhq/gitlab/latest/docs/resources/project_badge), which supports [placeholders](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/badges.html#placeholders) as `%{project_path}`.

With this input in our `.hcl` file:

```
badges = [{
  link_url  = "https://gitlab.com/%%{project_path}/-/pipelines"
  image_url = "https://gitlab.com/%%{project_path}/badges/%%{default_branch}/pipeline.svg"
}]
```

I receive this error:

```
│ Error: Invalid template control keyword
│ 
│   on <value for var.projects> line 1:
│   (source code not available)
│ 
│ "project_path" is not a valid template control keyword.
╵
```

As workaround, I added yet another `%`, and it worked. It seems that Terragrunt _eats_ the first `%`, and Terraform the second.

```
badges = [{
  link_url  = "https://gitlab.com/%%%{project_path}/-/pipelines"
  image_url = "https://gitlab.com/%%%{project_path}/badges/%%%{default_branch}/pipeline.svg"
}]
```

Thanks, it works as described [here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/2.69.0/docs/data-sources/iam_policy_document#context-variable-interpolation)

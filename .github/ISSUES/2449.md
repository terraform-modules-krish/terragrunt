# Really large input variables breaks Terragrunt values passing to Terraform

**tavlima** commented *Feb 14, 2023*

Due to the standard way TG passes the input values to TF, really large input variables hit the OS `ARG_MAX` (or `MAX_ARG_STRLEN`, not sure) limits.

Ideally, TG should automatically handle these scenarios, either by switching to `-var-file` based on the input size or by defaulting to that altogether.

Take a look here for a workaround

I've been hitting the same issue recently, but what I've done is that I just pass everything to the generate and any dependencies etc I have in the terragrunt.hcl file, I pass those to the input{} block.

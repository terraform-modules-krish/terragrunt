# Terragrunt cannot find pre-installed plugin

**gtirloni** commented *Jul 18, 2019*

I'm using a community-provided terraform provider that needs to be pre-installed to work since it cannot be downloaded from the Terraform Registry.

Everything works fine when using terraform directly and having the plugin in the same directory as the terraform binary:

```
$ ls /bin/terra*
/bin/terraform-provider-myprovider
/bin/terraform12
/bin/terragrunt19

$ cat main.tf 
provider "myprovider" {}

$ terraform init

Initializing provider plugins...

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```

However, when running it through terragrunt, terraform cannot find the plugin anymore:

```
$ terragrunt19 validate-all --terragrunt-non-interactive --terragrunt-source-update --terragrunt-tfpath /bin/terraform12 --terragrunt-include-dir environments/devel

...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Checking for available provider plugins...

Provider "myprovider" not available for installation.

A provider named "myprovider" could not be found in the Terraform Registry.

This may result from mistyping the provider name, or the given provider may
be a third-party provider that cannot be installed automatically.

In the latter case, the plugin must be installed manually by locating and
downloading a suitable distribution package and placing the plugin's executable
file in the following directory:
    terraform.d/plugins/linux_amd64

Terraform detects necessary plugins by inspecting the configuration and state.
To view the provider versions requested by each module, run
"terraform providers".


Error: no provider exists with the given name
```

This is my terragunt.hcl file:

```
terraform {
  extra_arguments "init" {
    commands = [
      "init",
    ]

    arguments = [
      "-force-copy",
      "-backend=true",
    ]
  }

  extra_arguments "validate" {
    commands = [
      "validate",
      "console",
      "import",
      "push",
      "refresh",
    ]

    arguments = [
      "-var-file=${get_terragrunt_dir()}/../global.tfvars",
    ]
  }

  extra_arguments "refresh" {
    commands = [
      "apply",
      "destroy",
      "plan",
    ]

    arguments = [
      "-refresh=true",
      "-var-file=${get_terragrunt_dir()}/../global.tfvars",
    ]
  }

  extra_arguments "lock" {
    commands = get_terraform_commands_that_need_locking()

    arguments = [
      "-lock=true",
    ]
  }
}
```

Versions:

* terraform 0.12.3
* terragrunt 0.18.7

Well, my tests were too simplistic. I've found the issue: a version constraint on the provider version. After I removed the constraint from the provider, everything worked fine.

Closing it. I think terraform might need some improvement on the error messages.

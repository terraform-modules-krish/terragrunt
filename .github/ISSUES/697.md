# Obtain AWS credentials from Vault AWS Engine

**binlab** commented *May 4, 2019*

In our infrastructure, we are using Vault Engine (https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/aws/index.html) for provisioning AWS credentials for Terraform by `vault_aws_access_credentials` - https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/vault/d/aws_access_credentials.html. Could you please add support to obtaining AWS credentials via Vault AWS Engine in the same model as in Terraforms?

This is not currently on our roadmap. Your best bet for now may be to do it via [hooks](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt#before-and-after-hooks).

# How to inherit parent terragrunt.hcl file's inputs block

**yagehu** commented *Jan 20, 2020*

In my top-level parent `terragrunt.hcl`, I have the following block. Taken directly from the terragrunt example repo:

```
inputs = merge(
  yamldecode(
    file("${get_terragrunt_dir()}/${find_in_parent_folders("region.yaml", local.default_yaml_path)}"),
  ),
  yamldecode(
    file("${get_terragrunt_dir()}/${find_in_parent_folders("env.yaml", local.default_yaml_path)}"),
  ),
  {
    aws_profile = "prod"
  },
)
```

How can I inherit `env`, `region`, and `aws_profile` in my child `terragrunt.hcl` file and use them as variables?

```
$ tree
.
├── terragrunt.hcl
└── us-west-2
    ├── region.yaml
    └── staging
        ├── dynamodb
        │   ├── backend.tf
        │   └── terragrunt.hcl
        └── env.yaml
```

`inputs` from the parent are automatically merged to the child when you add the following block to the child's `terragrunt.hcl`:

```
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}
```

Thanks for the prompt response! Let's say my child `terragrunt.hcl` file looks like this:

```
terraform {
  source = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ssm-parameter-store?ref=0.1.5"
}

include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

inputs = {
  parameter_write = [
    {
      name        = "/ctx-staging/dynamodb/tables"    // <----- I want to replace staging with a variable
      value       = data.terraform_remote_state.dynamodb.outputs.arn
      type        = "String"
      overwrite   = "true"
      description = "DynamoDB book table ARN"
    }
  ]
}
```

Is there a way to replace `staging` somehow with the `environment` variable merged into the child?

Also, side question: I can't seem to use `data.terraform_remote_state` here as I can't add a `data` block to `terragrunt.hcl`. How do people usually reference other modules' output?

Unfortunately, you can't reference other variables in other config yet. See https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/814 for the thread on this topic.

As a workaround, you will have to do the merge in terraform. E.g you might add a variable `name_suffix` and `environment`, and then set `environment` to `staging` in `env.yaml`. Then, you will construct the name in terraform (NOT `terragrunt.hcl`) as `"/ctx-${var.environment}${var.name_suffix}"`.

Terragrunt is not terraform code, so it does not support all the resources and data sources. [I am currently working on reference docs](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1009) to make it easier to discover all the supported features of terragrunt configuration, but in the meantime, you will have to go through the feature list in [the doc site](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io) to find what you need. For this use case, see [this section](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/use-cases/execute-terraform-commands-on-multiple-modules-at-once/#passing-outputs-between-modules).

I wrote up [an RFC](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1025) that introduces `import` blocks. This has the potential to address the use case described here, so would love feedback from those following this issue to see if it makes sense.

Just updating one of the links to point to the latest guide on the webpage.

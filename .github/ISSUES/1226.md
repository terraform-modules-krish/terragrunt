# Doesn't show interactive output of before_hooks when running *-all

**AronllStone** commented *Jun 19, 2020*

Hi
I have a configuration of hcl-file with before-hook action.
In this action, Terragrunt should execute my shell script with `echo` and `read` commands.
When I tried to run `terragrunt plan` or `terragrunt apply` or `validate` commands, it running very good and interact with User (in console I can see all output on time). But when I tried to run `terragrunt plan-all` or `apply-all` or `validate`, Terragrunt run this script, they waiting for some user-input but doesn't show any interactive output. Terragrunt shows them after hook are Terraform-cmd is done. I think it's not very good in this case and it can be a bug. In documentation I not found something about working of hooks with `*-all` commands.
Thanks!

```
terraform {
  before_hook "init_1" {
    commands = ["validate", "plan", "apply"]
    execute  = ["${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/test.sh"]
  }
}
```

Terragrunt version: v0.23.27
Terraform version: v0.12.26

Just to make sure I understand correctly:

1. When you run `plan`, `validate`, or `apply`, the hooks run correctly and, based on the contents of `test.sh`, prompt the user interactively for input.
1. When you run `plan-all`, `validate-all`, or `apply-all`, the hooks don't run? Or they run, but you don't see the output? Or you see the output, but you aren't prompted for input?

1. Yes
2. They run, I don't see the output but I can enter user-input to the script. All output I get after the completion of the terraform command

Hm, that does sound like a bug. Note that the `xxx-all` commands all run concurrently and interleave their output, but it's not clear to me why the output would come _after_ its corresponding input... If anyone has a chance to dig into this, a PR is welcome!

Also, the `xxx-all` commands aren't really ideal for use in an interactive mode. See #1084.

Ok
Many thanks!
Perhaps in the future, I will probably create PR, but before that, I need to learn a little Go language)

I also encountered this when attempting to use an S3 bucket for storing state. On the initial run, terragrunt was prompting me as to whether or not I wanted it to create the bucket, but the text was not written to the console. So, it appears as though terragrunt was frozen until I hit the return key.

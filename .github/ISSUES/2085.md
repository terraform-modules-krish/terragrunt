# GitTopLevelDir: doesn't inherit the parent environment variables

**lexton** commented *Apr 27, 2022*

The `GitTopLevelDir` doesn't use the provided TerragruntOptions it creates its own. 

Under the hood - the `RunShellCommandWithOptions` will copy the `opts.Env`.

This breaks tools like `asdf` that can manage installations of git and have a strict dependency on the `$HOME` env var.

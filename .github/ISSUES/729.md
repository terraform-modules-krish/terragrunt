Not sure if its the correct place to ask. I did look for a discussion forum, but did not any.

Here is the issue:

Initializing modules...

module.asg
Getting source "git::git@github.com:gruntwork-io/module-asg.git//modules/asg-rolling-deploy?ref=v0.6.24"
Error downloading modules: Error loading modules: error downloading 'ssh://git@github.com/gruntwork-io/module-asg.git?ref=v0.6.24': /usr/bin/git exited with 128: Cloning into '.terraform/modules/d7dc91a99408d1c9f2fd71251176ba6a'...

fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.

Please help.

`git::git@github.com:gruntwork-io/module-asg.git` is a private Git repo. Do you have access to it?

# Support for non-standard regions and endpoints

**Cinderhaze** commented *Jan 27, 2017*

Since terragrunt intracts with s3/dynamoDB, does it support the capability for overriding regions/endpoints, similar to the following?

https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/11358
https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/index.html#s3
https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/index.html#dynamodb_endpoint

I am wondering if it will work in an AWS environment similar to [aws GovCloud Region](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/using-govcloud-endpoints.html), which has different regions, partition values, and endpoints.

We have not built anything special to override regions or endpoints. PR is welcome!

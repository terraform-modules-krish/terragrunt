# Refactoring CLI package 

**levkohimins** commented *Jun 7, 2023*

Files for refactoring:
`cli/args.go`
`cli/cli_app.go`


Objectives:
* Get rid of multiple repetitions CLI arg names and env variables scattered across files.
* Create a struct for the argument containing all of its properties such as "Name", "EnvVar", "Usage", "Deprecated", etc.
* Generate CLI help dynamically based on the mentioned above structures
* Achieve well-readable code

# plan-all output file contains plan for only a single module

**mircea-c** commented *Sep 19, 2019*

Hi :wave: 
Apologies if this is a duplicate issue.

Running `terragrunt plan-all -out=/tmp/output.plan` in a structure like the following:

```
root
├── module-1
│   └── main.tf
├── module-2
│   └── main.tf
├── module-3
    └── main.tf
```
The `output.plan` file only contains the plan for one of the modules at the end of execution.

Looking at the terragrunt output this makes sense as it's running `terraform plan -out=/tmp/output.plan` in each module thus overwriting the plan file each time.

Possibly an easy fix to append a prefix/suffix to the output file name during execution. Will try to contribute a PR when I can.

Using `-out` with an absolute path definitely won't work, as all of the `plan` commands will write to the same file. Using a relative path might work...

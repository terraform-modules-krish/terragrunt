# Question about local_file and local-exec with terragrunt

**spothound** commented *Aug 25, 2021*

Hello there,

I have a Terraform module that is supposed to generate some `.yaml` files and store them locally with `local_file` in a git repository that is cloned using a 'local-exec' provisioner.

When I try to run such a module using Terragrunt, everything works but the repository is cloned in a directory on `.terragrunt-cache`, in concrete at '.terragrunt-cache/pR_toDHaYbE2c3Rst7lxAZ73-18/GcVVjmUHVOeaxPqtO1-ilkNrnM4' which is pretty non-intuitive for anyone using the module.

I was wondering if there is a way to specify where should these local-exec and local_file directives be executed or any option to make this more intuitive for anyone looking for the cloned directory and the generated files.

Any suggestion will be appreciated, 

Best regards,
<br />

Hi @spothound thanks for the bug report! 

Just to clarify, you're saying that cloning a git repo using `local-exec` puts it into a weird location when using `terragrunt`, but works fine with `terraform`. Is that correct? If so, could you provide a config to repro this? 

I used a simple config to try to repro this, but could not repro - the repo clone ends up in current directory both when using `terragrunt` and `terraform`:

```hcl
resource "null_resource" "example" {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "git clone git@github.com:gruntwork-io/terragrunt.git"
  }
}
```

Finally, one other idea: there's a [`working_dir` parameter of the `local-exec` provisioner](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/resources/provisioners/local-exec.html#working_dir) might help.

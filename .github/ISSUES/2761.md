# Support 'TF_CLI_CONFIG_FILE' from terragrunt.hcl

**vvarga007** commented *Oct 19, 2023*

**Describe the solution you'd like**
It would be great to configure the terraform config file location(TF_CLI_CONFIG_FILE) from terragrunt configuration file(terragrunt.hcl).

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
It can be passed as an environment variable (TF_CLI_CONFIG_FILE). It works but would be better from the terragrunt.hcl

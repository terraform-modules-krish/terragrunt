# terragrunt question: Mutliple accounts/subscriptions/service accounts for GCP and Azure similar to iam_role for AWS

**SarmaKHCL** commented *Apr 16, 2021*

Is there a way that we can achieve multi account/subscriptions/service accounts use case for GCP and Azure using terragrunt? I was checking option similar to iam_role.

Please suggest if there are alternate approaches.

We don't currently support this, but a PR to add support for such functionality would be much appreciated!

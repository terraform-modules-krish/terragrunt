# Failure when plan changes during apply-all

**sgasquet** commented *Nov 5, 2020*

Hi there,

We currently use terragrunt to deploy all the stack of our infrastructure on AWS.
Starting from nothing, and building Networks, Security, EKS cluster, Data etc.

Context:

> AWS EKS provider : https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-eks?ref=v12.2.0
> Terragrunt : v0.22.1
> Terraform : v0.12.24

The issue we are facing is during the EKS step, as the plan changes during the apply-all, Terragrunt fails and needs a second execution of the apply-all to finish.

With more details, the error of the provider is :

```
Error: Provider produced inconsistent final plan
When expanding the plan for
module.eks-1.module.eks.aws_autoscaling_group.workers_launch_template[1] to
include new values learned so far during apply, provider
"registry.terraform.io/-/aws" produced an invalid new value for .tags: length
changed from 7 to 8.
This is a bug in the provider, which should be reported in the provider's own
issue tracker.
```

The thing is, during the apply, EKS adds a tag which is :
```
              + "key"                 = "kubernetes.io/cluster/CLUSTER-eks-1-xxxx"
              + "propagate_at_launch" = "true"
              + "value"               = "owned"
```

Of course that tag was not present in the very first plan before the apply, as the value is computed at creation of the EKS cluster.
That causes the failure of the apply.

Is there any thing to do with terragrunt to "update" the plan during apply and successfully deploy in one time ?
Or is it only related to the aws eks provider ?


Thanks for your help !

Sylvain.

This is actually a terraform bug (and specifically, an issue with the provider, as indicated in the error message). I would recommend reporting this on https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws.

Side note: this looks awfully like https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/14085

@yorinasub17 problem solved in https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-eks/releases/tag/v13.2.0 !
I had to upgrade aws provider to 3.3.0 too and all went fine.

No more issue with tags, `apply-all` is now nice and smooth.

Glad to hear it was resolved! Thanks for closing the loop here!

# Evaluated templates get evaluated again when passed as inputs

**gbx-jzakrzeski** commented *Aug 8, 2023*

**Describe the bug**
When processing a template (such as with `templatefile`) and then attempting to use that as an input in Terragrunt, Terraform can throw errors if you have any escaped variables that you want passed through as part of the raw string.

**To Reproduce**
This is a simple module/terragrunt invocation that easily reproduces the problem.

```terraform
# main.tf
variable "input_map" {
  type = map(string)
}

output "test_result" {
  value = var.input_map
}

```
```hcl
# terragrunt.hcl
terraform {
  source = "./"
}

locals {
  test_string = templatefile("./example.yml", {})
}

inputs = {
  input_map = {
    contents = local.test_string
  }
}
```
```yaml
# example.yml
contrived:
  yaml:
    example: $${env:some_variable_for_something_else_to_process}
```

**Expected behavior**
I'm not sure if anything can be done about it, but I would expect to not have to triple-escape any static stuff in the template that I want to come out the other end. In the above example, you can work around the issue by changing `$${env:some_variable_for_something_else_to_process}` in example.yml to `$$${env:some_variable_for_something_else_to_process}`

**Nice to have**

rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other

**Versions**
- Terragrunt version: 0.36.12
- Terraform version: 1.1.4
- Environment details (Ubuntu 20.04, Windows 10, etc.): Not strictly relevant as I've observed this in MacOS (arm64) and arch with kernel 6.4.7 (amd64)

**Additional context**
This can be worked-around, as mentioned above, by just triple-escaping the variable, e.g. `$$${}` instead of `$${}` but it was definitely a hoot to figure out.

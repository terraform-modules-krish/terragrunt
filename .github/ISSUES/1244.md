I didn't know `terraform console` supported non-interactive mode! Interesting feature. I think Terragrunt would have to forward `stdin` to make this work. If anyone is up for looking into it, a PR with a fix is very welcome.

This can be very crucial for scripting

Resolved in [v0.50.7](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.50.7) release.

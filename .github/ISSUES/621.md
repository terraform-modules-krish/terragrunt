# get_env() not recognizing environment vars set by extra_arguments

**cnw004** commented *Dec 13, 2018*

When setting  env_vars inside of a extra_arguments block the environment variables that are set are not recognized by my remote_state block.

These variables *are* set in the environment as seen by my before_hook that simply prints out the env:

The get_env() function in the remote_state block *should* be able to recognize the environment variables that I just set. Instead, it sees them as being blank and uses the default value.

The `env_vars` in `extra_arguments` are only set as "extra arguments" for the Terraform command you're running (i.e., for `terraform apply`). They are not available to any other part of Terragrunt for now, including `get_env`, which happens while parsing your `.tfvars` file, potentially before `extra_arguments` are parsed...

Ok, thats completely explains that behavior. Thank you for explaining that. It would be nice to have a way to set variables this way. It would be helpful to have the top level tfvars file be the only file that you have to change in order to redeploy a new or slightly modified set of resources. Essentially one place to store / change your "volatile" variables that can change from run to run

# Positional arguments are not supported with `optional_var_files`

**bee-keeper** commented *Nov 4, 2019*

Hello,

Thanks for coming up with this, we'd previously been using makefiles for most of the functionality that Terragrunt replaces.  I have however found an issue with what must be a fairly common use case: create a plan with -out and apply this plan.  

This is not possible given the fact that 'arguments' expects each argument to be a pair and apply accepts a simple path to the plan file to apply.  Therefore the following config doesn't work:

```  
  /* plan args */
  extra_arguments "plan_args" {
    commands = [
      "plan"
    ]

    arguments = [
      "-out=${get_terragrunt_dir()}/terraform_${basename(path_relative_to_include())}.tfplan",
      "-lock=true",
      "-lock-timeout=60s"
    ]
  }

  /* apply args */
  extra_arguments "apply_args" {
    commands = [
      "apply"
    ]

    arguments = [
      "-auto-approve=true",
      "-lock-timeout=60s",
      "${get_terragrunt_dir()}/terraform_${basename(path_relative_to_include())}.tfplan",
    ]
  }
```
Is it possible to encapsulate this use case in terragrunt.hcl rather than having to pass the plan file in manually?

Thanks in advance,
<br />

There is actually no special processing that assumes the `arguments` property is a pair in the code. Did you you observe unexpected behaviors when you try to run this? Can you share the terragrunt logs for the runs where it didn't work as expected?

Hi thanks for the reply.  Please see below:

Thanks for sharing the logs!

As a sanity check, do you have `required_var_files` and `optional_var_files` in the `extra_arguments` block?
***

**bee-keeper** commented *Nov 5, 2019*

~~Nope, it's literally a working example of how to recreate this behaviour.~~

Yes, required_var_files (sorry, long day!).    
***

**yorinasub17** commented *Nov 5, 2019*

In that case, does it work if you flip the order of the `-var-file` arg and the state file arg?
***

**bee-keeper** commented *Nov 5, 2019*

Ok, it only works if there is no `--var-file` specified.  It's not possible to change the order of the args by flipping the directives in the extra arguments block.  

Actually, this is a better example of how to reproduce:

```
extra_arguments "apply_args" {
    commands = [
      "apply"
    ]

    arguments = [
      "${get_terragrunt_dir()}/terraform_${basename(path_relative_to_include())}.tfplan"
    ]

    required_var_files = [
      "${get_terragrunt_dir()}/../../${basename(path_relative_to_include())}.tfvars"
    ]
  }
```

**yorinasub17** commented *Nov 5, 2019*

If you are using `required_var_files`, you can actually add it in to the `arguments` list:

```
extra_arguments "apply_args" {
    commands = [
      "apply"
    ]

    arguments = [
      "-var-file=${get_terragrunt_dir()}/../../${basename(path_relative_to_include())}.tfvars",
      "${get_terragrunt_dir()}/terraform_${basename(path_relative_to_include())}.tfplan"
    ]
  }
```

The only case where there is currently no workaround is for `optional_var_files`.

**bee-keeper** commented *Nov 6, 2019*

Ok I think this might be solved and it isn't actually a bug.  Re your suggestion above, that results in this error:

```
Error: Can't set variables when applying a saved plan

The -var and -var-file options cannot be used when applying a saved plan file,
because a saved plan includes the variable values that were set when it was
created.
```

So since Terraform doesn't support passing -var-file to apply, once you remove -var-file and optional -var-file, all works as expected with the config below.

```
/* apply args */
  extra_arguments "apply_args" {
    commands = [
      "apply"
    ]

    arguments = [
      "-lock=true",
      "-lock-timeout=60s",
      "${get_terragrunt_dir()}/terraform_${basename(path_relative_to_include())}.tfplan"
    ]
  }

  /* vars args */
  extra_arguments "vars" {
    commands = [
      "destroy",
      "plan",
      "import",
      "push",
      "refresh"
    ]

    # .tfvars for set variables
    # .vars for declared variables
    required_var_files = [
      "${get_terragrunt_dir()}/../../${basename(path_relative_to_include())}.tfvars"
    ]

    # optional_var_files = [
    # ]
  }
```

Thanks for helping to get to the bottom of this.

# Add accesslogging_bucket_tags property to remote_state s3 config block

**trallnag** commented *Sep 28, 2022*

Currently the remote_state s3 config block only supports configuring tags for the S3 bucket where the state itself is stored. It would make sense to also make the tags for the access logs bucket configurable.

I assume that it should be fairly simple to implement since the code for tagging the state file bucket is already there.

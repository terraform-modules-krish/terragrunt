# Terragrunt CLI options in Terragrunt config

**erezzarum** commented *Sep 4, 2019*

Suppose i want to keep the download directory (.terragrunt-cache) in a different path than ".terragrunt-cache", currently the only solution is to provider either a "--terragrunt-download-dir=<PATH>" argument or a "TERRAGRUNT_DOWNLOAD=<PATH>" environment variable.
I couldn't find an option, but it would be greate to define this in a Terragrunt config file (terragrunt.hcl).
I tried this, but it does not work (it passes the "--terragrunt-download-dir" to Terraform)
```
  extra_arguments "terragrunt_cache" {
    commands = [
      "plan",
      "apply",
    ]
    arguments = [
      "--terragrunt-download-dir=${get_terragrunt_dir()}/${path_relative_from_include()}/.terragrunt-cache/${path_relative_to_include()}"
    ]
  }
```

The only not full workaround i could come up with is to create a shell wrapper script around the terraform binary and pass it to Terragrunt as the terraform binary path.

It would be really cool if we could provide terragrunt arguments from the terragrunt config itself.

If my skills in Go were as good as my Python skills, i wouldn't even post this issue and send a PR request.
hopefully someone talented than me could help with this :)

I've added `download_dir` to the config. @erezzarum did you want to see all of the CLI options in the config or just `download_dir` would be sufficient?

I named the config option `download_dir` as I think `terragrunt` namespacing is not necessary there.

@brikis98 There is some inconsistency in naming.

The CLI option is called `terragrunt-download-dir`, but the env var is called just `TERRAGRUNT_DOWNLOAD`.

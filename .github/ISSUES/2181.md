# --terragrunt-no-auto-approve not working properly

**jlepere-everlaw** commented *Jul 7, 2022*

I've been unable to use `--terragrunt-no-auto-approve` (added in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/2156) to work around some of the concerns (that I share) mentioned in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/486 about `--auto-appove` being appended to `run-all {apply, destroy}` commands.

Through debugging, I've found that the only time the `-auto-approve` flag isn't passed to `terragrunt` is when `--terragrunt-no-auto-approve` is supplied immediately after `run-all`. However, the `--terragrunt-no-auto-approve` flag is included in the `terraform` command, causing it to fail.
```
$ terragrunt run-all --terragrunt-no-auto-approve apply --terragrunt-working-dir ... --terragrunt-log-level debug
...
DEBU[0004] Running command: terraform --terragrunt-no-auto-approve apply  prefix=[...]
...
```

When the flag is supplied elsewhere, both `-auto-approve` and `--terragrunt-no-auto-approve` are included in the `terraform` command.

```
$ terragrunt run-all apply --terragrunt-working-dir ... --terragrunt-log-level debug --terragrunt-no-auto-approve
...
DEBU[0006] Running command: terraform apply -auto-approve -input=false --terragrunt-no-auto-approve  prefix=[...]
...
```

I'm running `terragrunt` version `v0.37.1`.

This feels like the result of a bug in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/2156, but maybe there is something I'm missing?

`--terragrunt-no-auto-approve` was added in version https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.38.1 You need to upgrade to that version for the flag to be parsed.

Oof, :man_facepalming:. It's working great after updating to the latest version (`v0.38.4`). Thanks, @yorinasub17!

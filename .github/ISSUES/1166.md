# --detailed-exitcode bad behavior (v0.23.2)

**thomvaill** commented *May 6, 2020*

When we pass `--detailed-exitcode` to `terragrunt plan-all`:

- If there is no diff: everything works fine
- If there is a diff: the command has an exit code 2, [as intended](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/plan.html#detailed-exitcode), but its output says it encountered some errors

```
➜  git:(master) ✗ terragrunt plan-all --detailed-exitcode
[...]
[terragrunt] 2020/05/06 16:25:31 Encountered the following errors:
Hit multiple errors:
exit status 2
➜  git:(master) ✗ echo $?
2
➜  dummy-product-infrastructure git:(master) ✗ terragrunt -v
terragrunt version v0.23.2
```

It should not appear as an error.

Ah, yea, Terragrunt just assumes any non zero exit code is an error in its logging, which is not the right thing to do for some Terraform commands. Would you be up for a PR to fix this?

We are hitting this issue, because when you use --detailed-exitcode the after_hooks do not run

I had a requirement to get the detailed exit code for detecting the drifts in our automation system and below is the steps I followed to achieve that:

1. Override the default terraform run using [`terraform_binary`](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#terraform_binary)
```hcl
locals {
  run_in_automation = tobool(get_env("TF_IN_AUTOMATION", false))
  tfplan_path = format("%s/%s", format("%s/../../tmp", get_parent_terragrunt_dir()), uuid())
}
terraform_binary = local.run_in_automation ? format("%s/../../scripts/terraform-wrapper.sh", get_parent_terragrunt_dir()) : "terraform"

terraform {
  extra_arguments "tfplan_out" {
    commands = ["plan"]
    arguments = local.run_in_automation ? [
      path_relative_to_include(),
      local.tfplan_path,
      "-lock=false",
      "-no-color",
      "-detailed-exitcode",
      "-compact-warnings"
    ] : []
  }
}
```

In the root of your repo, create `terraform-wrapper.sh` script that containes the following:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

function suppress_tf() {
  local action=$1
  shift 1
  command terraform "$action" "$@" 2>&1
  local exit_code="${PIPESTATUS[0]}"
  return "$exit_code"
}

CMD="$1"

if [[ "${CMD}" == "plan" ]]; then
  TG_RELATIVE_PATH="$2"
  TFPLAN_PATH="$3"
  shift 3
  TF_ARGS=("$@")

  # Create temp folder if not exists
  mkdir -p "$(dirname "${TFPLAN_PATH}")"

  RETRIES_LOOP=0
  TF_PLAN_OUTPUT=""
  TF_PLAN_EXIT=""

  # The for loop is to overcome this issue https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/25849
  while true; do
    if [[ "$RETRIES_LOOP" == "3" ]]; then
      echo "Reinitialization failed and exceeded the max retries (${RETRIES_LOOP})."
      break
    fi

    exec 5>&1
    TF_PLAN_OUTPUT=$(
      suppress_tf "$CMD" "${TF_ARGS[@]}" 2>&1 | tee /dev/fd/5
      exit "${PIPESTATUS[0]}"
    )
    TF_PLAN_EXIT=$?

    if [[ "${TF_PLAN_EXIT}" != "1" ]]; then
      # Exit the loop as the module was able to initialize all providers with no errors
      break
    fi

    # Check if terraform plan failed due to the corrupted plugins
    if [[ "${TF_PLAN_OUTPUT}" == *"Error: Could not load plugin"* ]]; then
      terraform init -input=false -backend=false -get=false -no-color -verify-plugins=false -upgrade=true 2>&1
      TF_INIT_EXIT=${?}
      echo "Plugins were corrupted and reinitialization completed with exit code: ${TF_INIT_EXIT}"
    fi
    ((RETRIES_LOOP++))
  done

  # Save plan output, exit code and the module path
  echo "${TF_PLAN_OUTPUT}" >"${TFPLAN_PATH}.output"
  echo "${TG_RELATIVE_PATH}" >"${TFPLAN_PATH}.path"

  # If exit code was 2 (Succeeded with non-empty diff) except diff in outputs, then ignore it
  if [[ "$TF_PLAN_EXIT" == "2" && "$TF_PLAN_OUTPUT" == *"Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy"* ]]; then
    echo "0" >"${TFPLAN_PATH}.exit"
  else
    echo "${TF_PLAN_EXIT}" >"${TFPLAN_PATH}.exit"
  fi

  # Remove default TF message from top to reduce the size of the output
  if [[ "${TF_PLAN_EXIT}" == "2" ]]; then
    sed -i '1,/Terraform will perform the following actions:/d' "${TFPLAN_PATH}.output"
  elif [[ "${TF_PLAN_EXIT}" == "0" ]]; then
    echo "No changes. Infrastructure is up-to-date." >"${TFPLAN_PATH}.output"
  fi

  # Remove leading and trailing blank lines
  sed -i -e :a -e '/./,$!d;/^\n*$/{$d;N;};/\n$/ba' "${TFPLAN_PATH}.output"

  # Checking if terraform plan exit code is equal to 2 (Means there is a drifts) then return 0
  # Terragrunt will report error if the exit code is not equal to 0.
  if [[ "${TF_PLAN_EXIT}" == "2" ]]; then
    exit "0"
  else
    exit "${TF_PLAN_EXIT}"
  fi

else
  terraform "$@"
fi
```

The next step is to export the variable `TF_IN_AUTOMATION=true` and then whenever you run `terragrunt plan-all` it will generate a list of text files with random GUID ids that has multiple files extensions with the module path + terraformt exit code + terraform output.

This is just an idea I'm sharing with you but you can customize it to get what you are looking for.

Any progress on this?
Looks like it's not easy to detect infra drift & send the diff to an issue/slack until exit code & behaviour matches terraform.
Also https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1470
Using terragrunt version v0.28.9

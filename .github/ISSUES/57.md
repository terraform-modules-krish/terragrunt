# v0.3.0 Missing Binaries

**mechastorm** commented *Nov 23, 2016*

Hi,

Great work on the latest release! :) Really looking forward to trying out the aquire-lock function.

But this release does not seem to have any binaries to download from?

Oh, good catch! Looks like there was some sort of transient build failure. Just re-ran the build and the binaries should be there now. Thanks for the heads up :)

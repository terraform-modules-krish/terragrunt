# terragrunt plan -refresh=true vs. terragrunt plan -refresh=false

**boldandbusted** commented *Feb 9, 2018*

I don't know if this is a local issue, but I see dramatic differences in the plan output when I pass '-refresh=false' to  terragrunt plan.

Example, with -refresh=true (the default):

```
  + aws_iam_role_policy.[REDACTED]
      id:                                    <computed>
      name:                                  "[REDACTED]"
      policy:                                "{\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n  \"Statement\": [\n    {\n      \"Sid\": \"\",\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Action\": \"s [REDACTED] }\n  ]\n}"
      role:                                  "${aws_iam_role.instance.id}"
```

vs.

```
  + aws_iam_role_policy.[REDACTED]
      id:                                                       <computed>
      name:                                                     "[REDACTED]
      policy:                                                   "${data.aws_iam_policy_document[REDACTED].json}"
      role:                                                     "${aws_iam_role.instance.id}"
```

and, I see data.* resources (used in the policies above) nicely broken out tabularly with '-refresh=false', but they are not shown when '-refresh=true', with " <= data.aws_iam_policy_document.logs_s3-write-only  [...]"

```
❯ terragrunt --version
terragrunt version v0.13.21
```
```
❯ terraform --version
Terraform v0.11.3
+ provider.aws v1.1.0
```

This is a cosmetic bug, but would be helpful to see the output nicely parsed and presented without disabling refresh. Thanks! Happy to provide more context.

Hm, I'm not sure how Terragrunt would have an effect on this. Does it happen if you run `terraform` directly?

@brikis98 Ah-ha! It happens with just bare terraform. So, I guess it is an upstream bug. Sorry about the noise. :/ Please close at will.

No worries. Thanks for checking :)

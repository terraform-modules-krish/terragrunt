# terragrunt ignores --terragrunt-config / TERRAGRUNT_CONFIG files

**tmclaugh** commented *Feb 16, 2017*

contrary to docs, terragrunt ignores --terragrunt-config arg, TERRAGRUNT_CONFIG env var, and .terragrunt file when looking for tfvars.  terragrunt will fail of the given file does not exist but it does not appear to read the file.  I'm currently working around this by symlinking terraform.tfvars back to the tfvars file I want.  This does not work long term for me as I'm trying to drive different environments entirely by separate tfvars files.

This looks to me like *Terragrunt* is using the `straycat.tfvars` (as it says in the log output), but *Terraform* is not, which is why you are being asked to enter the `aws_account` variable. This is expected. Terragrunt and its `--terragrunt-XXX` arguments do NOT affect which variables and variable files Terraform reads in. Therefore, the variables that are going to be visible to Terraform will be exactly the same as if you ran `terraform plan`. 

Terraform looks for variables in the following places:

* `default` values in the `variable` definition.
* `TF_VAR_XXX` environment variables.
* `-var` arguments.
* `-var-file` arguments.
* `terraform.tfvars`. 
* `terraform.tfvars.json`.

Notice how `straycat.tfvars` is not in that list. If you want Terraform to read variables from it, use the `-var-file` flag:

```
terragrunt plan --terragrunt-config straycat.tfvars --var-file straycat.tfvars
```

I admit this may be confusing, so I'd welcome a PR to update the docs to clarify the role of the `--terragrunt-config` flag and help others avoid this confusion in the future :)

Yes!  Okay, I had assumed the --terragrunt-config would affect --var-file.  Let me shoot a PR later.

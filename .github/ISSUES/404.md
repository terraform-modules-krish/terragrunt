# Add color to `terragrunt apply` output

**ilyasotkov** commented *Jan 18, 2018*

It'd be a better user experience if the output of `terragrunt apply(-all)`:

```sh
[terragrunt] [/path/to/live] 2018/01/18 05:56:56 Module /path/to/live has finished successfully!
```

would produce green-colored output when it's a success (exit 0), and red-colored output when it's a failure (exit 1).

Same for `terragrunt destroy`, of course.

That's really cool. Would be great to integrate into Terragrunt :)

@brikis98 I just tested and you can just pipe terragrunt into landscape. `terragrunt plan | landscape`

@davidneudorfer Hmm that didnt work for me on MacOS. Piping everything into "landscape" hides all terraform output and I'm just left with terragrunts output. I have the latest version of each tool as well. 

```
[terragrunt] 2019/01/15 12:27:11 Running command: terraform plan
No changes.
```

@yuriydee I just updated to the latest versions and everything still works.

terragrunt version v0.17.4
Terraform v0.11.11
Terraform Landscape 0.2.2

@davidneudorfer I took another look and yeah it actually works. So turns out landscape doesnt work when you have no infra changes and it truncates the output to just one line. But when I am removing/adding resources it works for me with both terraform and terragrunt.

The landscape will require ruby and it will increase my pipeline docker image. I wrote this simple solution to help me for now, at least to help us to see errors and visualize the changes.

# Is the new release v0.26.0 or v0.26.1?

**ahmad-hamade** commented *Nov 2, 2020*

I've downloaded the latest release `v0.26.0` however running `terragrunt --version` reporting `terragrunt version v0.26.1`

Doh! We accidentally created `v0.26.1` initially, realized we had skipped `v0.26.0`, and then renamed the release... But of course, the binaries had already been built with `v0.26.1` in them. @ina-stoyanova, To reduce confusion, it might be best to delete the `v0.26.0` release (and tag), and then recreate it with the exact same content (so make sure to make a copy of the release notes first!). That will result in the binaries being rebuilt with the proper version number.

@brikis98 @ahmad-hamade I've deleted the old tag and release **(v0.26.0)** & released a new version under the same tag. You should now be able to install the latest (v0.26.0) and see the correct tag on the binaries too (tested it on my machine too & can get the right version numbers)

Apologies for the confusion!

I'll keep this issue open today, just to see if there's any other confusion around this! @ahmad-hamade let us know if that's working for you when you have a chance to test it :)

Looking into this @ldormoy. Thanks for raising!

I've now raised an issue on the [**Homebrew Core repo**](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/64096)

This is not under our control, as we do not currently control, automate and release these taps - it's entirely done by the contributors to that open-source tool. 

Will post further updates as they come in.

@ldormoy the PR for Homebrew has now been merged. I just tested running 
```
brew install terragrunt | brew upgrade terragrunt
```
which now has the correct latest version "v0.26.2" 

```
~ terragrunt --version                                                                             
terragrunt version v0.26.2
```

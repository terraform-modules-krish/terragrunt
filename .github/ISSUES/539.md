# after_hook on init command executes twice

**lorengordon** commented *Aug 11, 2018*

I like to use an `after_hook` on `init` to further reduce code duplication, usually at least copying a common or backend .tf file into the tmp dir, but this setup ends up executing the hook twice... once after `init -from-module` retrieves the source, and again after `init` executes to initalize modules, the backend, and plugins.

I really only need the hook to execute after retrieving the source. It's not too big a deal if all I'm doing is copying a file like this, but I have other less common use cases where I'm doing something more (rendering the .tf file using jinja ðŸ˜­ ), where the duplication really slows things down.

Not too sure on the best approach to avoid this, but could maybe create new command-types recognized by the hooks. Such as `init-from-module` and `init-configure` or somesuch, to identify the different steps.

Ah, you're right, we do run `init` twice... PR to fix this is welcome! `init-from-module` and `init` does seem like a reasonable solution.

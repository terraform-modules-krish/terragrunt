# Support AWS Aurora Severless v2

**YLgearbox** commented *Apr 6, 2023*

Hi guys,

The current Aurora module in [terraform-aws-service-catalog](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog) does not support serverless v2.

I created this [PR](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/pull/1845) to update the upstream module and add relevant variables to support Aurora serverless v2.

The PR is ready for review.

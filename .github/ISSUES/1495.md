# How modular should infrastructure-modules be?

**trallnag** commented *Jan 18, 2021*

Hey everyone,

I'm trying to move my monolithic single-state "proof of concept" for a medium sized infrastructure to a more production ready and DRY layout. I want to use Terragrunt and also try out the recommended structure. Something along those lines:

```
infrastructure
├── generic-modules
│   └── cloned-and-modified-module-from-registry
├── live-components
│   ├── eks-auth-mgmt
│   └── eks-cluster-whatever
├── live-non-prod
└── live-prod
``` 

My question regards `live-components` also called infrastructure-modules in the Terragrunt example. 

* How modular should the modules in this directory be? 
* Should be input variables ONLY cover elements that are or might be different between different stages?

I'm asking this because if I make it completely modular, it kinda stops being DRY because I will end up with a bunch of duplicate code in different environments. But if I really only make the different things into variables they are not really modules anymore but something more like "packaged" infrastructure very specific to my requirements.

I can't derive the answer from the example

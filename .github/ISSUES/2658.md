# Impact of New HashiCorp License Announcement

**josh-padnick** commented *Aug 10, 2023*

Gruntwork co-founder here. We've just learned that [HashiCorp will be adopting a Business Source License](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-adopts-business-source-license) on all its products going forward. We're reviewing the implications of this in https://github.com/orgs/gruntwork-io/discussions/759.

Ah, that was my bad. Link fixed now. Sorry about that!

**Update: Gruntwork supports a vendor-neutral, community-driven, truly open source Terraform, which we are pledging support to as part of [OpenTF](https://opentf.org/).** 

Going forward, Terragrunt will support OpenTF. If HashiCorp reverts their license change, we'll re-evaluate the best approach for the Terragrunt community.

See also our recent blog post: [The future of Terraform must be open](https://blog.gruntwork.io/the-future-of-terraform-must-be-open-ab0b9ba65bca).

I'll close this issue for now, but any other questions or comments are welcome!

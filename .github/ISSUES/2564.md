# Terragrunt usage examples

**denis256** commented *May 11, 2023*

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Implement a documentation section that will show different full, end to end Terragrunt use cases:
* dependencies
* inputs passing
* secrets decryption
* passing sensitive outputs
* etc

Examples will be a fully runnable code that can be used in integration tests to validate Terragrunt builds

**Additional context**
A similar approach is already implemented in Terratest:

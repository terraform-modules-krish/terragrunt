# Difference between terrafrom code in ‘.tfvars’ file vs ‘.hcl’ file

**sanooprajps** commented *Nov 26, 2019*

Good day all.
I am a newbie in Terragrunt and pardon me for asking such a basic question.
I am wondering what is the difference of putting terragrunt code in ‘.tfvars’ file under 'terragrunt block and inside ‘.hcl’ file. Is it mandatory to use ‘.hcl’ file in latest version or something?!

I don't see terragrunt latest version is reading '.tfvars' files having terragrunt code in it, instead it is expecting to have a '.hcl' file!

Yes, use `terragrunt.hcl` for the latest version of Terragrunt.

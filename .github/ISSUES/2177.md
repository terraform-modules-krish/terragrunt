# the-commons-project/terragrunt-github-actions doesn't support run-all

**evgenyidf** commented *Jul 6, 2022*

Hello.

Running Terragrunt in the folder structure where no single global _**terragrunt.hcl**_ is defined, is not possible..
This GitHub action is missing new 'run-all' subcommand format.
Error message that I get is '_**Error: Must provide a valid value for terragrunt_subcommand**_':
```

You can use the legacy `xxx-all` variants (`plan-all`, `apply-all`, etc) as a workaround. Note that this is a third party plugin that we don't own or support, so this isn't really the right place to report issues with the action.

FWIW, they have an open PR to address this: https://github.com/the-commons-project/terragrunt-github-actions/pull/5

Closing this as it is not an issue with Terragrunt core.

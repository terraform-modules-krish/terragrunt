# Unable to use terragrunt if TF code is using modules

**A0069309** commented *Oct 31, 2022*

Hi terragrunter,

I try to build a playground to start with improving our environment and workflow. Ou existing Terraform stacks work well and we just want to cleanup our tfvar, backend and provider handling. 

So, I create a folder structure like this:

```
    +---tst
    |   |   terragrunt.hcl
    |   |
    |   +---01-keyvault
    |   |       terraform.tfvars
    |   |       terragrunt.hcl
    |   |
    |   +---02-baseservices
    |   |       terraform.tfvars
    |   |       terragrunt.hcl
    |   |
    |   +---03_1-aks_presetup
    |   |       terraform.tfvars
    |   |       terragrunt.hcl
    |   |
    |   +---03_2-aks
    |   |       terraform.tfvars
    |   |       terragrunt.hcl
    |   |
    |   +---03_3-aks-postsetup
    |   |       terraform.tfvars
    |   |       terragrunt.hcl
    |   |
    |   +---05-dns
    |   |       terraform.tfvars
    |   |       terragrunt.hcl
    |   |
    |   +---07-kap
    |   |       terraform.tfvars
    |   |       terragrunt.hcl
    |   |
    |   +---08-appgateway
    |   |       terraform.tfvars
    |   |       terragrunt.hcl
    |   |
    |   \---09-datadog
    |           terraform.tfvars
    |           terragrunt.hcl
```

Our stacks are using modules and if I try to get the magic out of terragrunt, I run into a problem if the modules are tryed to get installed:

```
╷
│ Error: Failed to download module
│
│ Could not download module "subscription_prefix"
│ (.terraform\modules\key_vault\azurerm\azurerm_key_vault\main.tf:1) source

│ Cloning into
│ '.terraform\modules\key_vault.key_vault.subscription_prefix'...
│ fatal: '$GIT_DIR' too big
│
```

I think, the reason is the terragrunt path in the cache directory. Does somebody have an idea how to solve this issue?

Hi,
looking at error `fatal: '$GIT_DIR' too big` I suspect that it is because of long paths where modules are downloaded, can be tried to use --terragrunt-download-dir / TERRAGRUNT_DOWNLOAD to download files in a directory like `C:\TMP`

Hey, thank you. You're right. I was able to fix my issue with 

`$env:TERRAGRUNT_DOWNLOAD="C:\Temp"`

on a windows machine. I wonder that this seems to happen only to a small amount of people - otherwise, my infrastructure is a lilttle bit more complex, so it could be possible that not so many terragrunters run into it.

Thanks for the input.

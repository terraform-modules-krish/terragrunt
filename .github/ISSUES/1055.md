# Figure out way to consolidate all the config structs

**yorinasub17** commented *Feb 18, 2020*

When https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1051 is merged, we now have 3 different structs representing the config:

- `TerragruntConfig`
- `terragruntConfigFile`
- The function, `terragruntConfigAsCty`

Is there anyway to consolidate these so there is only one struct?

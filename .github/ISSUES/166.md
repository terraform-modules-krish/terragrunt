# Dealing with Hard Coded Credentials for Private Repos

**tomstockton** commented *Apr 18, 2017*

Hi Terragrunt team!

First of all, love your work, I've bought the 'Up & Running' book and am following your advice on using Terraform as closely as possible!

Specifically, I'm using the [pipelines pattern that you referenced](https://medium.com/@kief/https-medium-com-kief-using-pipelines-to-manage-environments-with-infrastructure-as-code-b37285a1cbf5) and have created the following structure:

````
project_live repo:
  environment/
    component/
      terraform.tfvars # defines git source to private 'project_modules repo'

project_modules repo:
  component/
    main.tf # defines modules from the private 'core_modules repo'

code_modules repo:
  module/
    main.tf # defines groups of resources
````

All these repos are private, hence needing to define in the format (as per the [documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/sources.html#private-github-repos)) which hard codes user credentials into the git URL.  Obviously this isn't ideal as has been recognised in https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/1439 and I'm looking for a better solution!

Do you guys have any thoughts on how to deal with this?  Would it be a worthwhile feature that could be added to Terragrunt in order to allow variable interpolation into the source parameter?

I've achieved this with some success using a wrapper shell script to replace string `{VCS_CREDS}` with env var `${VCS_CREDS}` but it only works as far as pulling the `project_modules` repo.  Any references in `project_modules` to `core_modules` still have to be hardcoded due to `terraform init <url>` downloading any modules defined in `project_modules`.

Thanks!
<br />

Use SSH URLs. 

```hcl
terragrunt = {
  terraform {
    source = "git::git@github.com:foo/bar.git//baz?ref=v1.0.8"
  }
}
```

This will use your SSH creds, so no need to store any passwords in the code itself.

Ah, thanks.  I'd tried this but it failed.  I'm using bitbucket rather than github though and it seems that Terraform interprets `git::git@bitbucket.org:foo/bar.git//baz` as a reference to a local path.

I'll create an issue / PR for terraform to properly handle bitbucket SSH URLs.

For BitBucket, try:

```
git::ssh://git@bitbucket.org:foo/bar.git//baz
```

Almost!  Running that gives:
```
ssh: Could not resolve hostname bitbucket.org:foo: nodename nor servname provided, or not known
```

However if I change it to:

```
git::ssh://git@bitbucket.org/foo/bar.git//baz
```

Then it works!  Not sure if this is intended usage but it's a nice workaround  in any case.

Thanks again.

Nice! Thanks for following up.

I really think it would be helpful to add an example of this to the terragrunt documentation because to get this to actually work, combined with this less than helpful error message, https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/163, takes a fair amount of digging around.

**brikis98** commented *May 13, 2017*

@fosrias Agreed! PRs are very welcome :)

@brikis98 K. Will do. However, I ran into one issue using Terragrunt in a jenkins pipeline. It was necessary to run the following step to to auto accept github as a host prior to using Terragrunt: `ssh -T -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no git@git.autodesk.com || true`.

If not, then you would get an error of:

```
Host key verification failed.
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
```
I can add this to the documentation, but part of me wonders if Terragrunt needs to either accept `-oStrictHostKeyChecking=no` or have its own switch. Thoughts?

@fosrias The `git clone` and all associated permissions are handled 100% by Terraform, not Terragrunt, so I'm hesitant to add any ssh-specific behavior to Terragrunt itself. However, I'm totally in favor of adding this to the README.

Hello, 

is there also a way to use private github repros with https? In my company the firefall is blocking outgoing SSH connections. Thus ssh is not an option. I setup my environment to simply clone private repros with `git clone <repository-uri>` without the need to provide credentials. 

But unfortunately terragrunt cannot work with this. It always said that this repository does not exist:
```
terragrunt init
time=2022-02-18T12:56:11+01:00 level=error msg=Working dir ... from source git::https://github.com/my/repro.git does not exist
time=2022-02-18T12:56:11+01:00 level=error msg=Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1
```

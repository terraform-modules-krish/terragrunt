# Using Terragrunt With Custom Terraform Module In GitLab Pipeline 

**TitanRob16** commented *Oct 25, 2022*

I'm currently reading through this article to get started with Terragrunt: https://medium.com/@nanditasahu031/how-to-start-with-terragrunt-5cd1a842088a

I see that we need to authenticate via SSH to access a private repo: 
https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/keep-your-terraform-code-dry/#using-terragrunt-with-private-git-repos

Our current Terraform process hosted within GitLab simply references the custom module, like below:

````terraform
module "company-project" {
  source  = "gitlab.company.co.uk/tf-moduless/project/google"
  version = "0.0.12" //please use the latest version of the module
````

But Terragrunt seems to demand an SSH connection:

`terraform {
    source = "git::ssh://user@gitlab.company.co.uk/tf-modules/project/google?version=0.0.21"
}`

If I use the previous method, Terragrunt seems to look for the module as if it were a folder path and not a HTTPS path. 

Because we want to use Terragrunt via a GitLab pipeline, and the custom Terraform module is hosted in a separate GitLab repo, do we really need to set up SSH access? Or is there another way around this?

Hi,
`source` parameter supports the same naming schema as Terraform [module source](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/sources) and can reference HTTPS repositories.

I have exactly this setup but it's been some time since I set it all up so the details are fuzzy.

I have a `~/.terraformrc` with contents like
```
# Required to access gitlab.com infrastructure registry as source in images.tf
credentials "gitlab.com" {
token = "glpat-xxxxxx-xxxxxx"
}
```
If I trust my comments this is required for local operation and the token needs to allow read access to the module project.

For pipeline access I'm recreating the .terraformrc file:

```yaml
before_script:
  - echo "credentials \"gitlab.com\" { token = \"$CI_JOB_TOKEN\" }" | tee ~/.terraformrc
```

I've used a variety of addressing approaches over the years and still have alternatives commented:
```tf
module "badly-named" {
  # source = "git::ssh://git@gitlab.com/redacted/ops/dev-ops/badly-named.git?ref=1.0.0" # SSH git address works locally
  source  = "gitlab.com/redacted/badly-named/aws"
  version = "1.0.18"
  # source              = "../../badly-named/" # For fast local dev
  ...
 }

# Built-in tflint hook doesn't find .tflint.hcl if it's in the current directory

**brantb** commented *Feb 15, 2023*

Minimal example:

```bash
mkdir -p demo
cd demo
touch main.tf
cat > .tflint.hcl <<-END
  config { format = "compact" }
END
cat > terragrunt.hcl <<-END
  terraform {
    before_hook "lint" {
      commands = ["validate"]
      execute  = ["tflint"]
    }
  }
END
terragrunt validate
```

This script fails on the last line with the error "Could not find .tflint.hcl config file in the parent folders: Traversed all the day to the root". Running `tflint` directly works as expected (it reads the config file in the current directory and prints a warning in compact format).

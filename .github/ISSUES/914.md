# Unapplied dependency outputs error

**clarklai** commented *Oct 15, 2019*

Terraform v0.20.2

I'm following along with the documentation (https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt#unapplied-dependency-and-mock-outputs), but seem to keep running into the error:

```
Unsupported attribute; This object does not have an attribute named "platform".
```

I have a pretty straightforward configuration, using ```mock_outputs```, ```mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands```, and ```skip_outputs```:

```hcl
# hosting/terragrunt.hcl

terraform {
  source = "${get_terragrunt_dir()}/../../../core/hosting/module"
}

dependency "platform" {
  config_path = "../platform"

  mock_outputs = {
    api_gateway_name = "test_api_gateway_name"
  }

  mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands = ["validate", "plan"]
  skip_outputs = true
}

inputs = {
  api_gateway_name = dependency.platform.outputs.platform
}
```

Project structure:

```
root
├── hosting
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
├── platform
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
└── terragrunt.hcl
```

Is there something I'm missing?

Thanks

Hi can you share the full log, starting with the command you are running? That context helps a lot for debugging this. Thanks!
***

**yorinasub17** commented *Oct 16, 2019*

Oh wait, taking a deeper look at the config, I think I spot the problem:

In the inputs, you are referencing:
```
dependency.platform.outputs.platform
```

but in your definition of `mock_outputs`, you don't have a key for `platform`. Should this actually be: `dependency.platform.outputs.api_gateway_name`?

**clarklai** commented *Oct 16, 2019*

Thanks for the response @yorinasub17. You're absolutely right, I misread the documentation - I read it as ```mock_outputs``` keys are to match the keys of the ```inputs``` block. Thanks again for catching that.
***

**clarklai** commented *Oct 16, 2019*

@yorinasub17 It looks like even after changing the key, the issue persists:

```
Unsupported attribute; This object does not have an attribute named "outputs"
```

Here's the configuration:

```
# hosting/terragrunt.hcl

terraform {
  source = "${get_terragrunt_dir()}/../../../core/hosting/module"
}

dependency "platform" {
  config_path = "../platform"

  mock_outputs = {
    api_gateway_name = "test_api_gateway_name"
  }

  mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands = ["validate", "plan"]
  skip_outputs = true
}

inputs = {
  api_gateway_name = dependency.platform.outputs.api_gateway_name
}
```

@clarklai what Terragrunt command are you using ? Can you please share the full log as @yorinasub17 suggested ?
***

**clarklai** commented *Oct 16, 2019*

I resolved the issue. It was because I had ```skip_outputs = true``` in the dependency definition.
***

**yorinasub17** commented *Oct 16, 2019*

That sounds like a bug, since we introduced the behavior to return the `mock_outputs` when `skip_outputs = true` in [v0.19.29](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.19.29).

Would you be ok with sharing the logs still so we can investigate this further and make sure there isn't an issue in terragrunt itself?
***

**barryib** commented *Oct 16, 2019*

From what I understood from the [code](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/config/dependency.go#L175-L182), you get this error only when these 2 are true :
-  `skip_outputs` is true => you don't want to pull in states. This can make sense only with the `validate`
- mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands doesn't match the Terraform command you're using

In short, if you don't want to read states and don't provide allowed commands, you can't have dependency outputs.

@yorinasub17 @clarklai can we re-open this issue until we make this clair ?
***

**clarklai** commented *Oct 17, 2019*

I've made some updates to the configuration since my last post, however the issue returns when adding back ```skip_outputs``` to the configuration.

[skip_outputs.log](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/files/3737189/skip_outputs.log)

@clarklai Can you share your `/Users/clark/example/deploy/dev/email/terragrunt.hcl` configuration ?

**barryib** commented *Oct 21, 2019*

@clarklai any news ? Do you still have this issue ?

**clarklai** commented *Oct 23, 2019*

@barryib Here's the configuration for email/terragrunt.hcl:

```
terraform {
  source = "${get_terragrunt_dir()}/../../../core/email/module"
}

include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

dependency "platform" {
  config_path = "../platform"

  mock_outputs = {
    artifacts_bucket = "mock_artifacts_bucket_name"
    kms_key_id = "mock_kms_key_id"
    sns_dlq_name = "mock_sns_dlq_name"
  }

  mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands = ["validate"]
  skip_outputs = true
}

inputs = {
  artifacts_bucket = dependency.platform.outputs.artifacts_bucket
  kms_key_id = dependency.platform.outputs.kms_key_id
  sns_dlq_name = dependency.platform.outputs.sns_dlq_name
  root_dir = "${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/../.."
}
```

**yorinasub17** commented *Oct 23, 2019*

Ah the issue is in this line:

> mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands = ["validate"]

You are basically telling `terragrunt` that it can only use the `mock_outputs` if it is running `terraform validate`, but in the logs you were running `terraform plan`, so it doesn't read the `mock_outputs`.

You can resolve that particular error by adding `plan` to the list.
***

**clarklai** commented *Oct 29, 2019*

> You can resolve that particular error by adding `plan` to the list.

@yorinasub17 Yes, adding ```plan``` does remove the error.

However, does this mean that future ```terraform plan``` will continue to use the ```mock_outputs``` after ```terraform apply``` has been ran at least once?

***

**yorinasub17** commented *Oct 29, 2019*

If you have `skip_outputs = true`, then yes. However, if you remove that line, then it will only use the `mock_outputs` when there are no outputs upstream.
***

**yorinasub17** commented *Oct 29, 2019*

Going to close this now given that this is intended behavior.
***

**subhash-dream11** commented *Jun 20, 2021*

Hey @yorinasub17, I am facing similar issues while adding a new dependency variable in the existing dependency block. `mock_outputs` fails as there is already some output, so didn't pass the mock value for the new dependency. 

```
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

dependency "common_lb" {
  config_path = "../common1"
  mock_outputs = {
    lb_dns = "sample_dns"
    lb_dns2 = "sample_dns" # inserted after successful terragrunt apply
  }
  # for tf validate
  mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands = ["init", "validate", "plan"]
  
}


inputs = {
  common_lb_dns = dependency.common_lb.outputs.lb_dns
  common_lb_dns2 = dependency.common_lb.outputs.lb_dns2 # inserted after successful terragrunt apply
}
```
am I missing some configurations? If I add `skip_output=true`, am getting 

` Unsupported attribute; This object does not have an attribute named "outputs"., and 1 other diagnostic(s)`

@subhash-dream11 
I think I have been the same issue as your.
This the workflow :
- apply with terragrunt
- add ouput "my_new_output" to a module that already has ouputs
- plan with terragrunt
   + Running command: terraform output -json only shows previous outputs ( "my_new_output"  is absent)
   + terragrunt fails with  This object does not have an attribute named "my_new_output"

**Workaround** => use **mock_outputs_merge_with_state = true** available since terragrunt v0.31.4

**basarsoker** commented *Jan 29, 2022*

Could you give more details? This solves my problem, but I do wonder about the reason behind it.
***

**luispabon** commented *Jun 23, 2022*

Same issue on terragrunt v0.35.13. When adding new outputs, terragrunt fails with `Unsupported attribute; This object does not have an attribute named "MY_OUTPUT"` unless I add `mock_outputs_merge_with_state = true` to the config

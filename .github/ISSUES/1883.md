# Skip terragrunt info output

**pantelis-karamolegkos** commented *Oct 21, 2021*

Apologies for posting a rather non-issue here, but I took the initiative after reading [this](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/community/support/#github-issues), that imho encourages (at least does not directly discourage) asking for help here.

My problem is that no matter what `terragrunt` command I execute, it always starts with the following lines:

```
$ terragrunt show --json outfile 2>/dev/null
[INFO] Getting version from tgenv-version-name
[INFO] TGENV_VERSION is 0.31.10
```

```
$ terragrunt terragrunt-log-level=error plan
[INFO] Getting version from tgenv-version-name
[INFO] TGENV_VERSION is 0.31.10
```

I assumed that setting log level to `error` would perhaps help skipping those 2 lines.

Especially in the first case where I need a pure json `stdout` for me to parse, this causes problems.

Any ideas?

Hello,
try
```
$terragrunt plan --terragrunt-log-level error
```

```
$ terragrunt plan --terragrunt-log-level error
[INFO] Getting version from tgenv-version-name
[INFO] TGENV_VERSION is 0.31.10
```

same output

Interesting, don't see this in my environment, maybe it is side effect of terraform  log configuration: https://www.terraform.io/docs/internals/debugging.html

Does it still appear with an explicit TF_LOG setting?
```
$ TF_LOG=error terragrunt plan --terragrunt-log-level error

```

I still see it. Could be related to the fact I have installed `terragrunt` via `tgenv`? 

But at the end of the day it is the same binary, no?

```
$ which terragrunt
/home/pantelis/.tgenv/bin/terragrunt
$ TF_LOG=error terragrunt plan --terragrunt-log-level error
[INFO] Getting version from tgenv-version-name
[INFO] TGENV_VERSION is 0.31.10
```

Those look like logs from `tgenv` instead of `terragrunt` (https://github.com/cunymatthieu/tgenv/blob/dd720f62051bb748f75eee2d83d6768171d45830/libexec/tgenv-exec#L22). Unfortunately, `tgenv` doesn't expose a way to control its log level, and [it isn't really maintained](https://github.com/cunymatthieu/tgenv/issues/19).

I recommend you try out [tgswitch](https://warrensbox.github.io/tgswitch/) or [asdf-vm](https://asdf-vm.com/) (terragrunt plugin is [here](https://github.com/lotia/asdf-terragrunt)) instead for managing Terragrunt versions.

Since this isn't a terragrunt issue, going to close it.

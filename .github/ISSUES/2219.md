# aws s3 remote_state OperationAborted: A conflicting conditional operation is currently in progress against this resource.

**ricvai** commented *Aug 1, 2022*

Good day everyone. 

We have just recently updated Terragrunt from version 0.31.4 to 0.38.4 
This introduced new feature that automatically updates s3 remote state. That is fine - except that it fails from time to time. 
Sometime on account creation or account updating (as it tries to enable versioning on state) with the following :

```
time=2022-07-27T12:30:38Z level=error msg=7 errors occurred:
	* OperationAborted: A conflicting conditional operation is currently in progress against this resource. Please try again.

```
It is enough to re-run and it is back to normal.

I kind of understand why this is happening - due to aws limitation on s3 bucket, but somehow i thought this had to be handled internally...

The command we run is :
terragrunt run-all plan --terragrunt-non-interactive  -out planfile.tfplan

Over ten modules on single run.

Somehow strange that no one else reported the same, so thinking maybe I have missed something or there is somewhere documentation around the same ?

Thanks for an update.
<br />

Hi,
maybe `-terragrunt-log-level debug` will highlight more details on what is happening, also can be defined `retryable_errors` until it is handled in terragrunt

Good day,

Have enabled debug mode on terragrunt.
Once a new account is being created (multi account organisation) - it does not contain any bucket to store modules state.
During the initial plan phase on a new account - TerraGrunt performs modifications on bucket (creates it and enables versioning).
there are over 15 modules being applied at once.
But it fails on initial run - on the second run it would succeed - as would identify bucket in correct state. 
With that `retryable_errors` - we could get it up and running probably, but do not think it is a solution. Probably would be great if `Terragrunt` could initialise and configuration s3 bucket for state, only once during the run, but not for each of the modules - as it is doing it as of now. hence this and leads to (four similar errorsm only request id and host id are different ones )

# Issue finding terraform in path

**match-generobichaux** commented *Nov 30, 2022*

Running 

terragrunt version v0.40.2.
Terraform v1.3.5

PS C:\git\terragrunt\aadev\us-east-1\sns> terragrunt plan
time=2022-11-30T11:25:42-06:00 level=error msg=exec: "terraform": executable file not found in %!P(MISSING)ATH%!(NOVERB)
time=2022-11-30T11:25:42-06:00 level=error msg=Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1

Works fine with 
TG 0.31.0

I am running Windows and my terraform.exe is in C:\windows\system32

I fixed it by setting the environment variable.....

TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH in Windows to point directly to the locale of the executable

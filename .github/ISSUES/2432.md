# Unable to use locals inside include directive

**NicolaSpreafico** commented *Jan 27, 2023*

Hello,
this is an example of my Terragrunt hcl file
```
locals {
  var1 = "test"
  var2 = "test2"
}

include "root" {
  path = "../../root.hcl"
}

include "same_env" {
  path = "../${local.var1}.hcl"
}

include "same_module" {
  path = "../../_env/${local.var2}.hcl"
}
```

While running I get the error
```
ERRO[0000] /terragrunt/live/test/commons/terragrunt.hcl:10,16-21: Unknown variable; There is no variable named "local"., and 3 other diagnostic(s) 
ERRO[0000] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1 
```

Are variables not supported inside include directives?
I looked for the documentation but I didn't find any reference about this
<br />

Hi,
AFAIK, resolving of variables in the include path is not working since it requires first to load includes and then resolve `locals` from all files

While variables are not supported, for the moment I solved using the direct content which was the value of the variable
```
include "root" {
  path = "../../root.hcl"
}

include "same_env" {
  path = "../${read_terragrunt_config("../../root.hcl").locals.env}.hcl"
}

include "same_module" {
  path = "../../_env/${read_terragrunt_config("../../root.hcl").locals.module}.hcl"
}
```

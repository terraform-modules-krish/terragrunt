# terragrunt init prompts twice for creation of gcs bucket

**vasu2809** commented *Dec 10, 2022*

Hi 

We have observed that with latest versions of terragrunt and terraform, init commands prompts for gcs bucket creation twice and because of this --terragrunt-non-interactive command does not work and throws error saying 409 bucket already exists because of duplicate prompts

Can we know if this a bug or if this is a configuration issue that is prompting bucket creation twice?

Remote state GCS bucket edw-test-tfhcltest-state does not exist or you don't have permissions to access it. Would you like Terragrunt to create it?

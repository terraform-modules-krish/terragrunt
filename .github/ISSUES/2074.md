# FR: add option to skip outputs into mock_outputs_merge_strategy_with_state

**amkartashov** commented *Apr 18, 2022*

I'm running `terragrunt run-all --terragrunt-no-auto-init fmt -check -recursive -diff` in CI/CD pipelines to check formatting. This particular pipeline does not have access to backend because it's supposed only to validate the code.

This works well for stacks without dependencies, but fails if I have a dependency. I tried different options in terragrunt.hcl but now I realized that terragrunt will call `terraform output` on dependency no matter what value I use for `mock_outputs_merge_strategy_with_state` because it always check for existing outputs.

Note that `skip_outputs = true` won't fit because it will skip outputs for any other terraform command.

What I want is to add another option here which works similar for skip_outputs but only for allowed terraform commands. Mb it should be called this way:

```
dependency "vpc" {
  config_path = "../vpc"

  # mock outputs to allow format checks
  mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands = ["fmt"]
  mock_outputs_merge_strategy_with_state = "skip_outputs"
  mock_outputs = {
    vpc_id               = "temporary-dummy-id"
  }
}
```

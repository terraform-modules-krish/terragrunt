# Too many command line arguments. Configuration path expected.

**ArturChe** commented *Mar 29, 2021*

Hi!

There is an error 'Too many command line arguments. Configuration path expected.' when trying to call `terragrunt run-all apply`.
But at the same time the `terragrunt apply` works fine.

In debug mode I can see that `terragrunt run-all apply` has two additional arguments `-auto-approve -input=false` which are not present in `terragrunt apply`.

terragrunt version v0.28.15
<br />

It's a bit hard to debug this without more info. Can you provide the following?

- Can you extract the `terraform apply` call that terragrunt makes from the logs of `run-all apply` which causes the error?

- Can you paste the `terraform` block from your config, so we can see any `extra_arguments` you have configured?

Thanks!

Ah thanks for the info. This is actually a duplicate of https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1271. Please follow that issue to be notified when this gets resolved.

Closing as dup.

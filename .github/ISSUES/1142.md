# Option to reuse downloaded plugins?

**kernelold** commented *Apr 16, 2020*

I have a lot of modules related same plugins like hashicorp/aws
So while init I see a lot of messages like: 
```
- Downloading plugin for provider "aws" (hashicorp/aws) 2.57.0...
```
Is it possible to have an option to store this plugin somewhere in cache after first download and re-use it in other modules if version is the same instead of downloading every time?

In general the issue is - init can take a lot of time 
```
real    0m30.394s
user    0m7.236s
sys     0m5.631s
```
I guess it might be related to downloads.

Have you looked at https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html#provider-plugin-cache?

Yes, I tried `export TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR="$HOME/.terraform.d/plugin-cache"`
but I still can see :
```
Initializing provider plugins...
- Checking for available provider plugins...
- Downloading plugin for provider "kubernetes" (hashicorp/kubernetes) 1.11.1...
- Downloading plugin for provider "kubernetes" (hashicorp/kubernetes) 1.11.1...
```
and
```
Initializing provider plugins...
- Checking for available provider plugins...
- Downloading plugin for provider "aws" (hashicorp/aws) 2.58.0...
- Downloading plugin for provider "null" (hashicorp/null) 2.1.2...
- Downloading plugin for provider "aws" (hashicorp/aws) 2.58.0...
- Downloading plugin for provider "aws" (hashicorp/aws) 2.58.0...
- Downloading plugin for provider "null" (hashicorp/null) 2.1.2...
```
and so on...

does it mean a real downloading or it's just the same message if cache was used?

I'm slightly confused because I can see a cached plugins here

```
$ ls .terraform.d/plugin-cache/darwin_amd64/
terraform-provider-aws_v2.58.0_x4               terraform-provider-null_v2.1.2_x4               terraform-provider-tls_v2.1.1_x4
terraform-provider-kubernetes_v1.11.1_x4        terraform-provider-random_v2.2.1_x4
terraform-provider-local_v1.4.0_x4              terraform-provider-template_v2.1.2_x4
```

@kernelold It is not a real download but a copy from plugin-cache folder to your project folder...You can observe that by seeing how fast the command completes

In that case can `Downloading plugin` message be changed to `Got from cache` or something alike? Might be useful to understand what's really happening without assumptions.

That output is from Terraform, not Terragrunt.

# Allow `run-all apply` execute binaries with not runnig plan again

**chell0veck** commented *Aug 22, 2023*

Looking forward for native way to execute `run-all plan` and `run-all apply` efficiently without overhead operations.

Command `run apply` supports passing previously generated binary  and `run-all` does not.

In out pipelines we have many terragrunt submodules that we have to validate fist with `run-all plan` and then deploy with `run-all apply` that basically executes plan twice.

So far I've ended with a hook that generates separate module binary 

```
terraform {
    extra_arguments "generate_plan_binary" {
    commands  = ["plan"]
    arguments = ["--out=${get_terragrunt_dir()}/${basename(get_terragrunt_dir())}.plan.bin"]
  }
}
```

Maybe something like #2278 ?

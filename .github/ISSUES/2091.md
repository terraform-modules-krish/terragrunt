It's going to be hard to pinpoint where in the chain the bug is coming up from while you are going through terragrunt.

My suggestion would be to cut terragrunt out of the equation by using [terragrunt debug mode](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/debugging/) and use terraform directly with the terragrunt generated code. If the issue goes away, then it's clearly a bug in terragrunt. If the issue persists, `terragrunt` could still be an issue, but now we isolated the possibility to an issue in the code generation as opposed to the runtime.

something else is awry. doubt it terragrunt at this point given my most recent update on the azurerm ticket.  think that shows it ought be safe to close this out.

in the example to which you've directed me, the 'apply' does NOT actually apply, correct? (a true apply would break a number of things)

Well, as a maintainer, I can certainly see their point. If someone isn't using `terragrunt`, then they most likely don't understand what `terragrunt` is doing, and know if the bug is in the provider, `terraform`, or `terragrunt`, especially if they can't repro.

Using debug mode is useful as a tool in these cases to help see that:

- Terragrunt is mostly doing code generation and then passing through to Terraform.
- Identify a reproducible pure Terraform example to help all maintainers identify the bug.

If anything, it helps cut out the blame game relatively quickly.

In any case, we're happy to help if we identify that there is an issue in Terragrunt!

# Still trouble with --terragrunt-modules-that-include

**roehrijn** commented *Dec 23, 2021*

I'm opening this just to indicate that #1944 is not 100% fixed. I think it makes sense to reopen the issue. Don't know how much attention comments on closed issues get. That's why I opened this one here.

Thanks in advance!

# Set Environment variables for with before_hook script

**shpml** commented *Dec 9, 2022*

I have a before hook that runs a shell script to refresh my GCP token.

```hcl
  before_hook "before_hook" {
    commands = ["apply", "plan", "init", "refresh"]
    execute  = ["bash", "${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/../.scripts/gcp_auto_reauth.sh"]
  }
```

The script checks the expire time of the current token and refreshes the token if 10 mins remain using the below commands
```bash
GOOGLE_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN="$(gcloud auth print-access-token)"
export GOOGLE_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

The token gets refreshed but the `GOOGLE_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable isn't set within the context of the terraform command. Terraform fails with a `HTTP response code 401` error while accessing state. I assume due to the shell script being executed within it's own process so the updated token is set there only. 

What's the best way to overcome this issue?

hi,
AFAIK hook scripts can't change parent shell environment variables, additional env variables can be passed through `extra_arguments` / `env_vars`

Is it possible to set a custom environment variables in `env_vars` using a command or can they only be hard coded?

Just ran into the same issue and solved this by:

```hcl
terraform {
  extra_arguments "env_vars" {
    commands = get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars()
    env_vars = jsondecode(run_cmd("--terragrunt-quiet", "./bin/get-tf-env-vars.sh"))
  }
}
```

@niksauer Does your `"./bin/get-tf-env-vars.sh"` script return or print anything. My script is being called but I'm getting an error relating to jsondecode.

`Error in function call; Call to function "jsondecode" failed: invalid character 'H' looking for beginning of value., and 1 other diagnostic(s)`

Yes, I dynamically construct a JSON object with key/value pairs to be added to the environment. 


```sh
# get-tf-env-vars.sh

...

jq -n \
    --arg github_token "$GITHUB_TOKEN" \
    --arg github_token_prefix "$GITHUB_TOKEN_PREFIX" \
    '{"TF_VAR_github_token":$github_token,"GITHUB_TOKEN":$github_token,"GITHUB_TOKEN_PREFIX":$github_token_prefix}'
```

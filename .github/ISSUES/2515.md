# Terragrunt is not able to fetch outputs with module prefix enabled

**juljaeg** commented *Apr 4, 2023*

We receive the following error when there is a dependency block on another stack which is used to access outputs.

```
[...]
level=error msg=Module /code/cluster has finished with an error: Could not parse output from terragrunt config /code/base/terragrunt.hcl. Underlying error: invalid character '/' looking for beginning of value prefix=[/code/cluster] 
level=error msg=2 errors occurred:
	* Could not parse output from terragrunt config /code/base/terragrunt.hcl. Underlying error: invalid character '/' looking for beginning of value
[...]
```

I guess the flag is being inherited to this run but its output needs to be parsed. Maybe a condition is required to not inherit it to runs where the output needs to be parsed.

# Error while terragrunt apply-all

`
terragrunt -version
terragrunt version v0.27.1   

terraform version
Terraform v0.13.1

firstly i created aws account with admin access & added it in my system with aws configure. Then i wrote basic terraform playbook with s3-backend. I tested this playbook & all was ok. then i created terragrunt playbooks with same credentials and tried run command: terragrunt plan-all and got error:
`
Running command: terraform plan

I checked tf files in terragrunt cache and they are same as in tf playbook, that i created. how can i fix it?

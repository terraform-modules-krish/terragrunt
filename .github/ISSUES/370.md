# version manager and installer

**tomdavidson** commented *Nov 13, 2017*

I created a [Terragrunt plugin](https://gitlab.com/td7x/asdf/terragrunt) for [asdf-vm](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) and have an opened [PR](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-plugins/pull/19) to register it.

asdf gives osx and linux users (ci jobs) a 'universal' path to managing tool versions. Anyone care to test it out? especially osx users? Here is a quicky, but read the asdf README.md too. Once the asdf-plugin PR is approved, the git urls will not be needed:

```sh
$ asdf plugin-add terragrunt https://gitlab.com/td7x/asdf/terragrunt
$ asdf list-all terragrunt
$ asdf install terragrunt 0.8.13
$ cd test-dir
$ printf "terraform 0.10.0\nterragrunt 0.13.0\n" > .tool-versions
$ asdf install
$ echo terraform version && echo terragrunt --version
$ cd ..
$ echo terraform version && echo terragrunt --version
```

The asdf plugin repo maintainers are not very responsive - quite a few waiting prs, including this one. Could we add this to the install instructions or wait for it to be installable without the url?

How does it work before the maintainers merge it?

The asdf-plugin maintainers only maintain the repository and not the plugins so its just a matter of convenience and discovery.

Installing the terragrunt plugin currently requires the git url:
```sh
$ asdf plugin-add terragrunt https://gitlab.com/td7x/asdf/terragrunt
```

But once its merged  then it can be installed by name:
```sh
$ asdf plugin-add terragrunt 
```

I like to use it with transform because it keeps my terraform version in sync with the proejct - it does not read the HCL files but the projects's terraform ( and other tool ) versions are listed in the project's .tool-versions file (more than just and installer).

Its not a big deal, I was jsut doing some house keeping with open issues and wondering if I should close this ore do a PR on the README.md ...

Ah, gotcha. Sure, adding that to the README sounds great. Thx!

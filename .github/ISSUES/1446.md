# Import an existing resource

**arik-porat** commented *Nov 27, 2020*

Hi,
Can someone please explain me how can I import a state of an existing resource and make a use of it for example in a module?

Is there any example somewhere you can share?

When you run `terragrunt xxx`, in almost all cases, Terragrunt forwards your command to Terraform, resulting in `terraform xxx`. So to import resources, you run `terragrunt import`, and it'll call `terraform import` as normal. See the [Terraform `import` docs](https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/usage.html) for examples / instructions.

Can I generate "inputs" section automatically while importing a resource?

Why do you need inputs while importing?

# Add helper function to get `--terragrunt-source`

**yorinasub17** commented *Feb 18, 2021*

This could be useful to configure hooks that trigger only during local development

I'd like to help with this. Could you provide more information on what you're looking for?

Sure! The idea would be to add a new function to https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/config/config_helpers.go#L98 that returns https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/options/options.go#L85 and add an integration test that verifies this works both when `--terragrunt-source` is provided, and when it is not.

I created a PR with my changes: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1575

But I'm running into an issue when testing. I noticed that when I passing a source via the CLI (i.e. `--terragrunt-source`), the `getTerragruntSource` works as expected, but when I pass in a source via the config (i.e. `terraform { source = "./terraform_config_hcl" }`), I get an empty string.

Do you know why that might be happening?

EDIT:
Here's some more info on the error:

I have another question. As part of the PR (https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1575) , I need to include the use case for this update. Would you be able to elaborate on how users can make use of this feature?

This is the intended behavior of this command. As mentioned in the description, the intention is to be able to determine when a user passes in a different terraform source via the `--terragrunt-source` flag. So returning blank string when that flag is omitted makes sense.

I'll comment on the PR regarding use case.

Any update on that PR? Is it going to any version any time soon?

**suhussai** commented *Mar 18, 2021*

Sorry about the delay. I just pushed up another commit addressing the latest comments for https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1575.

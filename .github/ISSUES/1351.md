# Automatic backend creation not happening using terragrunt while executing command - terragrunt plan-all

**shubhamnegi1** commented *Sep 16, 2020*

Hi I am trying to do the terragrunt plan-all command, I have mentioned my terragrunt.hcl with remote state configuration. But it is not happening.
It is not throwing any error just stuck on generating backend.tf file for one of the module.

-terragrunt.hcl (with backend config)
-vpc
       -terragrunt.hcl
-eks (dependency on VPC)
       -terragrunt.hcl




<br />

We're going to need a lot more context to help here! Please share:

1. Your Terragrunt config
1. The command you're running
1. The full log output and error

this is my root level terragrunt.hcl content:

locals {
  provider_region = "eu-central-1"
  aws_region = "eu-central-1"
}

remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    encrypt        = true
    bucket         = "random-bucket-name123"
    key            = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = local.aws_region
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
  }
  generate = {
    path      = "backend.tf"
    if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  }
}

generate "provider" {
    path = "provider.tf"
    if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
    contents = <<EOF
    provider "aws" {
        version = "~> 3.1"
        region= "${local.provider_region}"
    }
EOF

While running terragrunt plan command in module level , it is creating the backend automatically. but  from the root level it is getting stuck on this log and not giving any error and nothing is happening.

**brikis98** commented *Sep 17, 2020*

So that's the full log output? It just exits after that? What's the exit code?
***

**shubhamnegi1** commented *Sep 17, 2020*

Yes it remains there. it does not exit. This is complete output.
please answer this - I just want to know is it possible to have state backend generated from command- terragrunt plan-all also?
it should be.
Also is my terragrunt.hcl is correct for it syntax or prerequisite wise?

Hm, seems like some sort of Windows bug...

Yea, `plan-all` just calls `plan` in each sub-module, and `plan`, in turn, supports all the usual backend features.

It's a bit hard to read without syntax highlighting and proper indentation. Could you  try a [fenced code block](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks) with `hcl` as the language?

I can confirm this behavior with Linux (5.8.14-arch1-1).

Terragrunt: 0.25.2
Terraform: 0.13.4.

I had the same error on a mac. I hit enter when it hung though, and I got this message:
My state bucket name is invalid in this case.

[terragrunt] 2020/12/03 14:08:19 Encountered the following errors:
InvalidBucketName: The specified bucket is not valid

Customer is getting the following error when attempting to use Terragrunt GCS management features:

```
Create GCS bucket $BUCKET_NAME returned an error: googleapi: Error 404: The requested project was not found., notFound.
```

Hi,
I suspect it may be an issue with used service account permissions or was used service account from a different GCP project.

Usage of service account with "Editor" role on [sample project](https://github.com/denis256/terragrunt-tests/blob/master/issue-2149/terragrunt.hcl) worked fine.

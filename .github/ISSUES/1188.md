# path_relative_*_include() when using read_terragrunt_config()

**TimJones** commented *May 19, 2020*

I have a usual hierarchical region > environment > project/app setup and I'm wanting to be able to set things like tags at all levels to save redefining them.

Currently I have something like the following:

```
.
├── ap-south-1
│   ├── prod
│   │   ├── environment.hcl
│   │   ├── rds
│   │   │   └── terragrunt.hcl
│   │   └── vpc
│   │       └── terragrunt.hcl
│   └── region.hcl
├── eu-west-1
│   ├── non-prod
│   │   ├── environment.hcl
│   │   ├── rds
│   │   │   └── terragrunt.hcl
│   │   └── vpc
│   │       └── terragrunt.hcl
│   ├── prod
│   │   ├── environment.hcl
│   │   ├── rds
│   │   │   └── terragrunt.hcl
│   │   └── vpc
│   │       └── terragrunt.hcl
│   └── region.hcl
├── common.hcl
├── terragrunt.hcl
└── us-east-1
    ├── prod
    │   ├── environment.hcl
    │   ├── rds
    │   │   └── terragrunt.hcl
    │   └── vpc
    │       └── terragrunt.hcl
    └── region.hcl

```
The parent `terragrunt.hcl` is nothing more than setting up the bucket+generator, and provider generator.   
The child `terragrunt.hcl` does more heavy lifting:
```
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

locals {
  common      = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("common.hcl"))
  region      = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("region.hcl"))
  environment = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("account.hcl"))
}

terraform {
  ...
}

inputs = merge(
  local.common.inputs,
  local.region.inputs,
  local.environment.inputs,
  {
    name = "vpc-${local.environment.inputs.environment}"
    ...
    tags = merge(
      local.common.inputs.tags,
      local.region.inputs.tags,
      local.environment.inputs.tags,
      {
        team        = "platform"
        provisioner = "terraform"
      }
    )
  }
)
```
For the most part it works, but in `common.hcl` I have the following:
```
inputs = {
  ...
  tags = {
    ...
    terraform_path = path_relative_from_include()
  }
}
```
Unfortunately, this always returns the tag value as simply `.`, I'm geuessing because the `read_terragrunt_config()` function works differently from the `include` block.

I have tried using a generator in the parent `terragrunt.hcl` file to output a text file with the path, then have the tag read in it with `terraform_path = "${file("tg-path.txt")}"` but the generator runa after the config is read/merged, so the file doesn't exist at that point. Same with `before_hooks`. I also tried a generator to create a `tags.auto.tfvar` file, but the just overrides anything set by the child `terragrunt.hcl`.

Is there a way I can work around this and have `common.hcl` config extract the child path, or do I have to add this tag manually in all child `terragrunt.hcl` files?

EDIT: Ah I misread your example and the original suggestion here doesn't work.

This is unfortunately an unsupported use case right now. I believe this will be possible once we [implement `import` blocks](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/_docs/rfc/imports.md), but unfortunately we haven't had the chance to implement it yet.

We can also alternatively look into getting the `path_relative...` functions to work with `read_terragrunt_config`, although that gets tricky. E.g., should it be relative to the caller, or in the context of the file calling it?

I fully admit this is an edge-case scenario, and since a work-around already exists (declaring `terraform_path = path_relative_to_include()` in the child `terragrunt.hcl` inputs attributes) this isn't a major issue.

The `imports` blocks look like they would totally cover this scenario, especially the idea of a `find_in_parent_folders_from_importing_config()` function so it can all be left in the parent `terragrunt.hcl` and keep things good and DRY :+1: Looking forward to it.

I ran into this as well for a slightly more complicated use-case.  I was thinking about backwards compatibility and I think you would need 2-3 functions or an optional argument to control what relative path is used.  Since `import` seems like a big change I would love it if this could be implemented.  The 3 options for relative path would be:
* path relative to included file (the current case)
* path relative to including file (the file calling `read_terragrunt_config()`)
* path relative to top file (the project file calling `include { path = find_in_parent_folders() }`)

Using the path relative to the top file you could have an included file like this used by all of your projects, e.g. called `global_include.tf`
```hcl
locals {
  common      = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("common.hcl"))
  region      = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("region.hcl"))
  environment = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("account.hcl"))

  combo_value = "${local.common.locals.something}-${local.environment.locals.anotherthing}"
}
```

And have the ability to pass `local.combo_value` as an input in the project `terragrunt.hcl`:
```hcl
locals {
  globals      = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("global_include.hcl"))
}

inputs = {
  name_prefix = local.globals.locals.combo_value
}
```

Can you elaborate in your example config how `path_relative_to_*` will be used? It's a bit hard to grasp this from the code snippets since you don't have any calls to these functions.

It would help if you can provide ideal versions of the functions you'd like to use in your use case, and what they might return. That can help gauge what is needed here.

+1 on this one. My use case is to simplify defining new regions by having `region.hcl` use `path_relative_to_include()` to parse out the directory name it's in, and use that as the region name.  Then the name of the region doesn't have to be duplicated in both the directory hierarchy and the contents of each `region.hcl`.  If there's a way to do this that doesn't require handling of this case, I haven't found it yet.

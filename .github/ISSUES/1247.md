# apply/plan behavioural differences with "--terragrunt-non-interactive"

**esn89** commented *Jul 7, 2020*

terragrunt version v0.21.6

When I run `terragrunt plan-all` and enter in "yes" for each of the dependencies in the stack, I get a nice output detailing all the resources I need to create including the dependencies.  In my example, it's the VPC stack which the DNS stack is dependent on:


Output:
```
An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

```
Basically what I'm trying to illustrate is that with `terragrunt plan-all` it shows me all the dependencies which needs to be deployed too. 

However, things are different when I use:  `terragrunt plan-all --terragrunt-non-interactive`, it simply shows the DNS module's changes and not the VPC one.

-------------

With apply-all it is also very similar.  `terragrunt apply-all` allows me to enter "yes" for all the modules which will be created and there is no problem.

With `terragrunt apply-all --terragrunt-non-interactive` I get this issue:

```
[terragrunt] 2020/07/07 18:25:11 Encountered the following errors:
dev/us/project/terragrunt.hcl is a dependency of dev/us/vpc/terragrunt.hcl but detected no outputs. Either the target module has not been applied yet, or the module has no outputs. If this is expected, set the skip_outputs flag to true on the dependency block.
```
This does not make sense because I expect it's behaviour to create those dependent resources when I run the `terragrunt apply-all --terragrunt-non-interactive` command.

What do your `terragrunt.hcl` files look like?

Hi @brikis98 

The DNS one looks like:

```
terraform {
  source = "../../../modules/dns"
}

include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

dependency "project" {
  config_path = "../../../../resources/dev/us/project"

  #skip_outputs = true

  mock_outputs = {
    project_id = "my-test-dev"
  }
  mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands = ["validate", "plan"]
}

dependency "vpc" {
  config_path = "../vpc"

  #skip_outputs = true

  mock_outputs = {
    network_self_link         = "vpc.network.test"
  }
  mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands = ["validate", "plan"]
}

dependency "kafka_network" {
  config_path = "../../../../services/kafka/dev/us/vpc"

  #skip_outputs = true

  mock_outputs = {
    kafka_network_self_link = "vpc.kafka_network.test"
  }
  mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands = ["validate", "plan"]
}

inputs = {
  network_self_link         = dependency.vpc.outputs.network_self_link
  network_url = dependency.kafka_network.outputs.kafka_network_self_link
  project_id = dependency.project.outputs.project_id
}
```


The VPC one looks like:
```
terraform {
  source = "../../../modules/vpc"

  extra_arguments "credentials" {
    commands = get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars()
  }
}

include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

dependency "project" {
  config_path = "../../../../resources/dev/us/project"

  #skip_outputs = true

  mock_outputs = {
    project_id = "my-test-dev"
  }
  mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands = ["validate", "plan"]
}

inputs = {
  project_id = dependency.project.outputs.project_id
}
```

and project:

```
terraform {
  source = "../../../modules/projects"

  extra_arguments "credentials" {
    commands = get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars()
  }
}

include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

dependency "folders" {
  config_path = "../folders"

  #skip_outputs = true

  mock_outputs = {
    folder_id = "123443211234"
  }
  mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands = ["validate", "plan"]
}

inputs = {
  folder_id = dependency.folders.outputs.folder_id
}
```

Which folder are you running `apply-all`/`plan-all` in? And does the folder tree contain all the dependencies, or are they outside of that folder?
***

**esn89** commented *Jul 9, 2020*

@yorinasub17 

The folder where I am doing the apply-all/plan-all is in:  `../../../modules/dns`.  This folder only contains the `terragrunt.hcl` for DNS.

The other ones such as VPC and Projects are located elsewhere, which is outside of the folder of `../../../modules/dns`..

Try passing in `--terragrunt-include-external-dependencies` in addition to `--terragrunt-non-interactive`. Terragrunt tries to use conservative answers for `non-interactive` mode, and as such will not automatically include external dependencies.

@yorinasub17 

This is the flag that I'm looking for!  Thanks so much!

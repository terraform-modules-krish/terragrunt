# get_aws_account_id gives wrong account when attribute is used

**DiegoLelis** commented *Jan 14, 2021*

So, I'm trying to use get_aws_account_id.
When I use this configuration file:
```
iam_role = "arn:aws:iam::2***********:role/PlaygroundAccount"
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}
```
If I run: `terraform init` 
It will give me the wrong IAM account ID: 
`9*******`
which is the base account, but not the role account

But when I use: 
`terraform init --terragrunt-iam-role "arn:aws:iam::2***********:role/PlaygroundAccount"
It will give me the right account ID:

`2********`

Is there something else that I should be implementing to make this work or is this a bug?

Additional details:
Version: v0.26.7
All the commands are applied to the right account with the role, just the get_aws_account_id gives me the wrong account id.

I believe this is related somehow:

Do you mean `terragrunt init`?

Certainly seems like a bug. Could you share the exact command you ran and the full log output?

Sure thing!
Here is the log of the command that is giving the wrong acc_id:

Here are the logs when I use the argument:

Thanks for the log output... One thing I just noticed:

In the first set of logs, I see:

```
[terragrunt] 2021/01/25 10:56:33 Assuming IAM role arn:aws:iam::2*************:role/AWSAccountInfrastructurePlayground
```

And in the second set I see:

```
[terragrunt] 2021/01/25 11:01:44 Assuming IAM role arn:aws:iam::2************:role/MyRole
```

So it's assuming an IAM role in both cases, but it's a different IAM role... Is that intentional?

No, that was me forgetting to change the name of the role  xD. I've tried to edit everything to avoid sharing sensitive info.

**brikis98** commented *Jan 29, 2021*

Roger.

Well, I'm not sure why these two behave differently, but def seems like a bug. We're a bit overloaded right now, so if anyone has time to dig into the code and submit a PR, it would be very welcome!

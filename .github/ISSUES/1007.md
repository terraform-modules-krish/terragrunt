# terragrunt v0.21.11 has wired behaviour on handling map variable in .hcl file

**neo-liang-sap** commented *Jan 16, 2020*

Hello,

I found in v0.21.11 terragrunt has wired behaviour on handling map variable in .hcl file.

e.g.

in my terragrunt.hcl file i defined an map like this

```
inputs = {
annotations = {"garden.sapcloud.io/purpose" = "development"}
}
```

the variable `annotations` is defined in my variables.tf like this 
```
variable annotations {
  default = {
    "garden.sapcloud.io/purpose" = "development"
    "confirmation.garden.sapcloud.io/deletion" = true
  }
}
```

the command `terragrunt apply` reported following error:

```
Error: Incorrect attribute value type

  on .terraform/modules/aws_gardener_shoot/gardener-shoot.tf line 40, in resource "gardener_shoot" "aws_cluster":
  40:     annotations = var.annotations
    |----------------
    | var.annotations is "{\"garden.sapcloud.io/purpose\":\"development\"}"

Inappropriate value for attribute "annotations": map of string required.

```

this issue only exist with map definition in hcl files, if i define same variable in .tf file there's no problem

`{"garden.sapcloud.io/purpose" = "development"}` is obviously an map of string but terragrunt doesn't work.

Thanks.

This is the same issue as https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/997 and https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1002. You need to add the `type` information to the `annotations` variable in terraform, `type = map(string)`.

# Terragrunt destroy not working as expected

**dudicoco** commented *Nov 21, 2021*

Following to the addition of https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1823, a couple of issues came up:

1. The destroy plan output no longer shows when running `terragrunt destroy` and there are existing dependent modules, it will only show output for `Detected dependent modules: ...`
2. The dependent modules detection does not run when running `terragrunt run-all plan -destroy`

Hi @dudicoco , can be shared example repositories where these issues appear and on which terragrunt version

Detection of dependencies may not work in cases when modules include relative paths and parsing may fail in case of reading from the repository root.

Destroy plan may not show if there is nothing to destroy:
Example destroy of: https://github.com/denis256/terragrunt-dependency/tree/master/modules/module2

Hi @denis256.

You can see in the image that you've posted that the destroy plan does not appear before the message `WARNING: Are you sure you want to continue?`, only the detected dependent modules messages appear. 

Without detected dependent modules warnings messages the destroy plan would appear before the warning message.

What are your thoughts about the second issue where dependent modules detection does not run when running `terragrunt run-all plan -destroy`?

Hi, idea is to print destroy plan and then the list of dependent modules? - need to check how to implement that since destroy plan is printed by Terraform and once confirmed it will perform destroy, printing list of dependencies after destroy will not help

Missing dependencies for `terragrunt run-all plan -destroy`  looks like a bug - will check

The idea is to print destroy plan + list of dependent modules before the message `WARNING: Are you sure you want to continue?`.

@denis256 @yorinasub17 @brikis98 any updates?

I think there is some confusion on the prompts here. `terragrunt destroy` now results in two warning prompts:

1. The prompt to confirm if you want to proceed with destroying the current module when terragrunt detects dependent modules pointing to it. This is the warning prompt you are referring to.
2. The prompt from the `terraform` process asking if you want to proceed with the `destroy`, after the plan is made.

I think logically, it makes sense to keep these two prompts. I see two problems with skipping the first prompt and only relying on the second prompt (which is what you are suggesting):

- We would be tied to the behavior of Terraform. It doesn't seem intuitive to me that `-auto-approve`, a `terraform` flag, can be used to skip terragrunt prompts. The current behavior allows you to skip the terragrunt prompt with `--terragrunt-non-interactive`, but keep the `terraform` prompt.
- It would be super easy to gloss over the dependent modules log, as the destroy `plan` log is almost always significantly longer. In that case, we might as well not have that prompt at all.

The one thing we should probably do here is to adjust the warning message for the first prompt so it doesn't look like you won't get the second prompt. I'm not sure what the best wording would be for that...

To clarify, I didn't suggest skipping the first prompt - I suggest displaying both prompts, both the dependent modules log and terraform destroy plan.

I guess from a CI point of view it would be ok to only display the dependent modules log, as we should probably fail the CI if dependent modules are found when running `terragrunt destroy`.

@yorinasub17 the more important of the two issues for us is to support displaying the dependent modules log when running `terragrunt run-all plan -destroy`, that would be a great addition.

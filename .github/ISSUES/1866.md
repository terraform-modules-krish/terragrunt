# Access denied on terragrunt init after latest upgrade using multi account setup

**lundbird** commented *Oct 13, 2021*

After upgrading to v0.35.1, our terragrunt projects get access denied after running the init command. We are using the feature where we assume an iam role in our terragrunt.hcl and use the aws access keys for an aws account that can assume this role.
```
iam_role = "arn:aws:iam::myid:role/terraform"
```
```
$terragrunt init -input=false
Remote state S3 bucket domain-terraform-dev does not exist or you don't have permissions to access it. Would you like Terragrunt to create it? (y/n) n
ERRO[0012] AccessDenied: Access Denied
        status code: 403, request id: xxx, host id: xxx
ERRO[0012] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1 
```

The bucket was previously created and exists in this account. Perhaps the role assumption is not working as expected?

This is fixed in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.35.2 (binaries should show up shortly, ~10mins)

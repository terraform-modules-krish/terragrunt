# Support for Terraform 0.14

**ChristophShyper** commented *Dec 3, 2020*

Since Terraform 0.14.0 is out can you please allow using it with Terragrunt?

```
Terraform version: 0.14.0
The currently installed version of Terraform (0.14.0) is not compatible with the version Terragrunt requires (~> 0.13.0).
```

My mistake, I forgot version constraint was put in the configuration.

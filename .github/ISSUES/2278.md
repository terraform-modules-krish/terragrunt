# Option to implicitly plan before apply when running run-all apply

**hypervtechnics** commented *Sep 14, 2022*

This is in response to: https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31366

It would be nice to have an option to implicitly do a `terraform plan -out=some.tfplan` before the `terraform apply some.tfplan` for each module/stack when running `terragrunt run-all apply`. The other option would be to implement the plan saving into `terraform apply` but so far this was denied by the terraform team for (I think valid) reasons.

Things to consider (which just came to my mind):

- extra_arguments and other customizations affecting the plan command: Should they also be taken into account for the implicit plan? I think so.
- hook triggering before or after the implicit plan or would a new hook type be added (my favorite option)

Proposal:

Something like a `--terragrunt-implicit-plan-before-apply` as a boolean parameter and a `--terragrunt-implicit-plan-out` as a string parameter. If the plan out parameter is a relative path this should save output to the module/stack directory, if an absolute one of course to the absolute one ðŸ˜‰.

Benefit:

A savable plan per stack will be produced procedurally which would cover a lot of the other use cases defined in other issues for e.g. beautifing. Using the new hook type it is also possible to e.g. calculate a blast radius and fail the apply if too much is changed.

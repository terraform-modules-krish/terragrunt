# S3 trigger deleting previous trigger.

**bpastiu** commented *Mar 2, 2020*

Hello,

I would like to add a question related to creating S3 notification triggers using terragrunt/terraform. 
We had a situation on this where we created a trigger for an s3 bucket which already had a trigger and the original one got deleted.
We tried to create the trigger with another prefix and whatnot but it always gets deleted. I was able to manually create a new trigger using a different prefix. So that bucket can have 2 PUT event triggers as per our request but we couldn't do it from terragrunt.

Is there anything we are missing?

This is actually a terraform question, and we typically don't answer generic terraform questions here. I recommend posting this question on stack overflow, with some relevant code snippets.

With that said, without looking at any code, my best guess as to what is happening is that you are using `aws_s3_bucket_notification`, which doesn't support appending triggers (you can only have one of these resources per bucket). This means that you need a central module with the `aws_s3_bucket_notification` resource that declares all the triggers as subblocks. See the "Trigger multiple Lambda functions" example in [the docs](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/s3_bucket_notification.html) for what I mean.

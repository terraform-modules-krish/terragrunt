# Add helper function for listing all terraform commands to which locking applies.

**josh-padnick** commented *Apr 21, 2017*

Here's a common recommended `terraform.tfvars`:

```hcl
terragrunt = {
   ...
   terraform {
     # Force Terraform to keep trying to acquire a lock for up to 20 minutes if someone else already has the lock 
      extra_arguments "retry_lock" {
         commands = [
            "init",
            "apply",
            "refresh",
            "import",
            "plan",
            "taint",
            "untaint"
         ]
      }
   }
}
```

But this list of terraform commands that apply to locks is non-obvious. It'd be nice if we could add another helper command here that generates this array for you. It would make the `terraform.tfvars` look something like:

```hcl
terraform { 
   extra_arguments "retry_lock" {
      commands = [ get_terraform_commands_that_need_locking() ]
   }
}
```

Should be fixed by #205.

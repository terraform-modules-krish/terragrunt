#  --terragrunt-parallelism should default to 1 by default.

For commands such as `plan-all` parallelism param should default 1.
Having parallel execution by default can lead to unexpected results, even with defined explicit dependencies between modules.

Hm, what sort of unexpected results are you referring to?

I have a hook that authorizes with AWS. That script is not thread safe and caused obscure issue.

I see. TBH, that doesn't sound like a very common case, so I'm not sure changing this default for everyone to fit that corner case would make sense.

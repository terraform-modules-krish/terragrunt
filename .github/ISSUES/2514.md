# Terragrunt error messages when not auth'd are confusing

**Dhertz** commented *Apr 3, 2023*

When not auth'd, terragrunt gives the message `Error: Initialization required. Please see the error message above.` - there is no message above, which is not intuitive to know what this means, and that auth is required.

Secondly, when auth'd in the wrong environment (when there is a dependency, it is fine - `Failed to load state: AccessDenied: Access Denied`, when there is not, it is a bit more baffling - `Remote state S3 bucket dev-terraform-state does not exist or you don't have permissions to access it. Would you like Terragrunt to create it? (y/n)`). Again, it would be great to know that this is an auth error, rather than having a dev bucket made in stage, for example.

Hi,
will be helpful to specify used terragrunt version and share execution output executed with `--terragrunt-log-level debug` it may help to identify the root cause

Tested with:
`terragrunt version v0.31.2`
`terragrunt version v0.45.1`

Example on terragrunt version `v0.45.1` with `TERRAGRUNT_INCLUDE_MODULE_PREFIX=1` set, default log level:

```
$ terragrunt plan

```

The issue triggering the message is that the user does not have valid AWS authentication set in their environment, and terragrunt/terraform doesn't have access to the required s3 buckets. It's just that this is not immediately clear to the user invoking the command. Some indication of what is returning a 403 would probably help the user work out what they need to do next.

Usually message `Error: Initialization required. Please see the error message above.` is returned from Terraform, most probably better output handling is required

Just tested terragrunt version `v0.45.6` with `TERRAGRUNT_INCLUDE_MODULE_PREFIX=1` when running a terragrunt, plan or init while using s3 as the statefile backend and expired AWS tokens. It still only returns the following:

```

Error: Initialization required. Please see the error message above.


ERRO[0001] exit status 1 
```

In release https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.45.14 also was updated error message to include module path in which the error happened

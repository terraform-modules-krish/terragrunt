# Error refreshing state: AccessDenied when assuming a role with a profile

**david-wirelab** commented *Feb 12, 2021*

hi there,
Following is the current setup:
Terraform v0.14.4
Terragrunt v0.25.4

The CI/CD pipeline does the following as first steps:
- Pulls in a docker container having Terraform and Terragrunt installed
- Runs `terragrunt init`

There are 3 AWS working accounts `CICD` `NonProd`  and `Security`
The problem started going from dedicated users in each AWS account eg.

`main.tf`
```
provider "aws" {
  alias      = "CICD"
  region     = var.REGION
  access_key = var.CICD_ID
  secret_key = var.CICD_KEY
}

provider "aws" {
  alias      = "APPS"
  region     = var.REGION
  access_key = var.APPS_ID
  secret_key = var.APPS_KEY
}

provider "aws" {
  alias      = "SEC"
  region     = var.REGION
  access_key = var.SEC_ID
  secret_key = var.SEC_KEY
}
```

`terragrunt.hcl`
```
remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    encrypt        = true
    bucket         = "${get_env("TF_VAR_CLIENT_NAME")}-terraform-state"
    key            = "${get_env("TF_VAR_NAMESPACE", "nonprod")}/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "${get_env("TF_VAR_REGION", "eu-central-1")}"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-state"
  }
  generate = {
    path      = "backend.tf"
    if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  }
}
```

(the above worked without issues)

To having one `Master` AWS account where the IAM users are created and they assume roles in the target AWS accounts which there are 3 `CICD` `NonProd` `Security`
Policies and roles are fine have verified all by running various commands after `aws sts` was run - confident the permissions are working.

Current code:

`main.tf`
```
provider "aws" {
  alias   = "CICD"
  region  = var.REGION
  profile = "CICD"
}

provider "aws" {
  alias   = "APPS"
  region  = var.REGION
  profile = "APPS"
}

provider "aws" {
  alias   = "SEC"
  region  = var.REGION
  profile = "SEC"
}
```

`terragrunt.hcl`
```
remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    encrypt        = true
    bucket         = "${get_env("TF_VAR_CLIENT_NAME")}-terraform-state"
    key            = "${get_env("TF_VAR_NAMESPACE", "nonprod")}/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "${get_env("TF_VAR_REGION", "eu-central-1")}"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-state"
    profile        = "CICD"
  }
  generate = {
    path      = "backend.tf"
    if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  }
}
```

The corresponding AWS profile is created in a local file during runtime and creds are stored in `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE`. Assume role works too during `terragrunt init` however the below error is received later down the line:

```
+ terragrunt init --terragrunt-non-interactive

```

However when the same IAM creds and role is in use with `TERRAGRUNT_IAM_ROLE` variable set `terragrunt init works` so this points to perhaps some issue with Terraform.

Any help is greatly appreciated as I have been battling this for long and have not been able to point out the problem yet!

I recently had a similar problem with terraform on Azure. 

Turns out that terraform needs a provider without alias to run correctly (even if this one is not actually used to create resources).

In other words, try to add this to your case:
```
provider "aws" {
  region  = var.REGION
}
```

I'm having a similar issue where terragrunt v0.45.11 has been inexplicably reporting `ERRO[0000] AccessDenied: Access Denied` even before terragrunt calls terraform.

In my aws/config profile I have a `role_arn` specified. However, I have a _second_ `role_arn` specified in the backend that must be assumed to allow modifications to the tfstate bucket. So, this is a nested assume role situation. Kind of like this:
```
account (orgA) -> role 1 (org B) -> role 2 (org A) -> modify tfstate bucket (org A)
```

These nested roles work in terraform. I believe that terragrunt isn't assuming the second role that is specified in `remote_state` in order to do things like automatically updating the tfstate bucket for encryption, versioning, etc. Evidence for this is that I was able to get past this issue by setting both `disable_bucket_update` and `skip_bucket_versioning`.

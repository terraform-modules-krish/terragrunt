# Pre-installing Plugins

**apobbati** commented *Sep 2, 2017*

In an environment where access to `releases.hashicorp.com` might not be available (Firewall/network policy), what's the recommended way to pre-install the plugins so that Terraform+Terragrunt doesn't try to download them from the `releases.hashicorp.com` site?

I was following the guide [here](https://www.terraform.io/guides/running-terraform-in-automation.html#pre-installed-plugins) for Terraform, but couldn't locate the `.terraform` directory when running Terragrunt.

The `.terraform` directory will be in a temp folder. The log output from Terragrunt should tell you the exact temp folder being used.

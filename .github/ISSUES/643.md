# Encrypt the bucket and log the access on the AWS S3 Bucket and encrypt the DynamoDB Lock Table of the TF State

**Xtigyro** commented *Feb 1, 2019*

Is there a way within Terragrunt to encrypt the whole S3 bucket where the TF state is preserved and the DynamoDB table where the lock of the state is stored?

# [FR] Allow enabling current experimental terraform built-in functions for terragrunt itself

It seems there is no way to enable current experimental `terraform` built-in functions such `defaults()` so they can be used within `terragrunt` context.

Related issue #1882.

JFTR, as a workaround you can use the similar `try()` [built-in function.](https://www.terraform.io/language/functions/try)

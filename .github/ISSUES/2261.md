# terragrunt fails when TERRAGRUNT_FETCH_DEPENDENCY_OUTPUT_FROM_STATE=true

**SerhiiSokolov** commented *Aug 30, 2022*

I'm using terragrunt 0.38.9
hcl file has
```
dependency "tests" {
  config_path = "../../test/sources/"
  mock_outputs = {
    arn = "arn:aws:iam::1234567890:policy/mock_policy_id"
  }
  mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands = ["plan", "init"]
  mock_outputs_merge_strategy_with_state  = "shallow"
}
```
Dependency from the config has not been created yet.

If set TERRAGRUNT_FETCH_DEPENDENCY_OUTPUT_FROM_STATE to true and run plan getting the error

```
DEBU[0001] Fetching outputs directly from s3://terraform-state-*****/****/test/sources/terraform.tfstate  prefix=[/*****/sources] 
ERRO[0002] NoSuchKey: The specified key does not exist.
        status code: 404, request id: ******, host id: ********** 
ERRO[0002] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1 
```

Hi,
the module was already applied? or it is first run?

I encountered the same issue.

@SerhiiSokolov @Udbv are you trying to apply changes only to a dependent object without its dependency?
What Terragrunt command do you run (with args)?

Hi @SerhiiSokolov @Udbv,

Unfortunately I didn't manage to repro this issue. Could please provide your configs for the reproduction?

# Remote state with included terraform.tfvars not working

**dpetzel** commented *May 3, 2017*

```
terragrunt --version
terragrunt version v0.12.15

terraform --version
Terraform v0.9.4
```

I'm trying to follow the model outlined in the README, where I have a child `terraform.tfvars` and a parent `terraform.tfvars`.

My child looks like this:
```
terragrunt = {
  include {
    path = "${find_in_parent_folders()}"
  }
}
```

My Parent looks like this:
```
terragrunt = {
  remote_state {
    backend = "s3"
    config {
      bucket  = "my_bucket-${get_env("TF_VAR_region", "PLEASE_SUPPLY_REGION")}-${get_aws_account_id()}"
      key     = "state/${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
      region  = "${get_env("TF_VAR_region", "PLEASE_SUPPLY_REGION")}"
      encrypt = true
    }
  }
}
```

* I run apply and resources are created properly.
* I look in my s3 bucket and there is no state file.

After poking around the `tmp` directory, I can see that all the resources are actually in the `terraform.tfstate file` and there is no backend set in the file
```
cat /tmp/terragrunt-download/p7PRMQn3UEi0IaAMEIJAYJnoNN8/xHwmtCx0_z7OWwadwwx_ofKNb0o/module/terraform.tfstate | grep -c backend
0
```
So I'm not entirely sure what I'm doing wrong, but given the output below, it seems to indicate it's trying to configure the remote backend (via the `terraform init` command), however it doesn't seem to be doing that successfully.


Here is the (cleaned up) output from the apply:
```

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your environment. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

And of course as soon as I posted this I realized my mistake. I failed to include the backend setting in an actual `.tf` file. IE
```
terraform {
  backend "s3" {}
}
```

You saved me! I've been thinking why it was not working for me and I had just to add main.tf with the above!

# terragrunt's --assume-role option and sts token expiration in terraform (default one hour duration)

**ebarault** commented *Jun 28, 2018*

Hi, 

Not a new subject but I regularly get caught by the default 1-hour sts token duration retrieved through the aws sts assume-role method called by terragrunt when running with the `--terragrunt-iam-role` option.

As I implement AWS multi-account setup, dedicating one account to aws iam users management and other accounts to segregate aws resources, i need to run terragrunt with the  `--terragrunt-iam-role`  option to jump in the right environments with temporary tokens.

The problem occurs when running very long terraform tasks such as restoring an rds aurora cluster from a backup which can easily take several hours.

I'm under the impression that terragrunt calls the assume-role method without specifying the `duration-seconds` param which enables to extend the default 1-hour duration up to 12 hours.

Then, passed 1 hour, terraform at some point fails with this error:
```
ExpiredToken: The provided token has expired
```

What would you think of letting terragrunt users specify the duration of sts tokens fetched by the `--terragrunt-iam-role` option to avoid breaching the token validity period?

**EDIT**: reviewing the code and the aws go provider, it seems that the default duration is set to 15 minutes, and I already am able to run with terragrunt terraform tasks longer than 15 minutes, so there might be something else already renewing the token, right?

**EDIT2**: instead of using the `--terragrunt-iam-role` option i manually endorsed the role using the `aws sts assume-role` function, setting the token duration to 4 hours, and all went flawlessly when using the terragrunt's option failed each time. So i think it validates my proposal :-)

+1. Making the timeout settable is a great idea.

@ebarault This could be the default duration set on the role https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_manage_modify.html#id_roles_modify_max-session

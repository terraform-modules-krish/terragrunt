I have a Terraform module for creating VirtualNetwork with the following folder layout

And I have Terraform Live Repo with the following layout

The Terragrunt File for the Virtual Network declares a dependency on Resource group and uses the output of Resource Group. The configuration file is as follows:

When i run  terragrunt plan --terragrunt-source "/Users/dkonasani/Desktop/Go/src/TFModules/terraform-azure-demovn" in the Virtual Network folder i receive the following error:

I see that it is complaining about a file in the Vendor folder for the testsusing Terratest in the Terraform Module. Now when i go back to the Module and delete the vendor folder and run 
terragrunt plan --terragrunt-source "/Users/dkonasani/Desktop/Go/src/TFModules/terraform-azure-demovn"
It gives the desired output. 
To reproduce the error when i go back to the Terraform Module run tests (it creates the vendor folder) and come back to live repo Virtual Network folder and run terragrunt plan it gives the same error as above. 
Any guidance with this issue will be helpful

This looks like a bug in the terragrunt source download function for local source that is unable to handle symlinks correctly.

Either fixing the bug, or a feature to provide folders/files to ignore when "copying" will probably do the trick here.

In the meantime, the workaround you have (to wipe the vendor folder each time) works, or you can try upgrading usage of `terratest` (at least [v0.21.0](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/releases/tag/v0.21.0)) and switch to using [go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules). With go modules, the dependencies are tracked in your go path and not in `vendor`, so hopefully, you won't have this problem.

Currently i am using Terragrunt version  v0.21.6. AS a work around I am wiping out the vendor folder and running Terragrunt, will work on changing to go modules.

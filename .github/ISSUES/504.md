# Unable to run terragrunt plan on different machine

**Moncky** commented *Jul 2, 2018*

I am sure I am doing something incorrect but cant figure it out.

I have a git repo on my local machine, in which if I run terragrunt plan or apply things happen as I would expect.
I have pushed that repo and then cloned it on a different machine, which for the moment has the same key and profile name in the .aws/credentials file.

my terraform.vars file looks like this
```

terragrunt = {
  #Configure Terragrunt to automatically store tfstate files in s3
  remote_state = {
    backend = "s3"

    config {
      encrypt = true
      bucket = "my-tfstate-files"
      key = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
      region = "eu-west-2"
      profile = "myprofile"
      dynamodb_table = "my_tfstate_lock"
    }

    s3_bucket_tags {
      owner = "terragrunt"
      name  = "Terraform remote state store"
    }

    dynamodb_table_tags {
      owner = "terragrunt"
      name  = "Terraform remote state lock"
    }
  }
}
```
When I check out my repo and try and run terragrunt plan or plan-all it doesn't see the s3 bucket, even though I can browse the bucket with awscli

```

```
Is there somthing obvious I should be checking to get this working,  I need my colleagues and build systems to be able to take actions on this repo

~~`Remove the line `profile = "myprofile"` to use your default AWS profile or update `.aws/credentials` with a profile named `myprofile`~~

EDIT: you said the profile matched.

Enable Terraform verbose logging with `TF_LOG=debug` and search the log for `s3/ListObjects`. This might tell you whats going wrong.

As I suspected I was doing something foolish, like not passing the AWS credentials to my build job correctly.

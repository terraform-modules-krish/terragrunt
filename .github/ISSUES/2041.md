# Adding dependencies causes infinite "backend initialization required" errors

**tdevopsottawa** commented *Mar 15, 2022*

I have a terraform with terragrunt setup to deploy azure resources where the folders are setup like this:

- terragrunt
    - network
    - acr
- terraform
    - network
    - acr

/terragrunt/network/terragrunt.hcl thus specifies "../../terraform/network" as its terraform source, and so on. I'm using S3 buckets as a remote backend for the states.

I'm trying to have an output value from the network terraform run be applied to the acr terraform run, but it's not working.

Both run perfectly fine independently with no errors, but the second I try to add dependency settings to the ACR terragrunt file, it doesn't work anymore.

This is how I'm trying to do it:

```
dependency "network" {
  config_path = "../network"
}

inputs = {
   ...
  vnet_id  = dependency.network.outputs.vnet_id
}
```

The network run does save the output correctly - I checked the tf state file in the S3 backend.

But after putting that into the terragrunt.hcl file, any attempt to run any terragrunt command (init, plan, apply, etc.) fails with:
```

$ terragrunt init
time=2022-03-15T16:33:09-04:00 level=warning msg=No double-slash (//) found in source URL C:/<redacted>/terraform/network. Relat

```
Attempts to run terragrunt init again with -reconfigure or -migrate-state flags produces the same result. In fact, typing gibberish terragrunt commands does as well (ie. if I type "terragrunt blahblah" it does the same thing, doesn't even complain that "blahblah" isn't a valid command).

I tried completely resetting all my local caches and lock files, even deleting the remote states and trying everything all over again, but the issue persists.

I'm running in Windows using Cygwin.

Hi,
it is not clear for me how `apply` was invoked, `terragrunt run-all apply` or `terragrunt apply`, also will be helpful to have a basic project where this issue occurs.

`terragrunt apply` was used

When I attempted to reproduce the issue on Ubuntu, everything worked fine.

Suspect it's just my Windows environment being a little hacky (Cygwin instead of the WSL, etc.)

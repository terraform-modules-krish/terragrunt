# Upgrading from Terragrunt version 0.28.12 to 0.34.3 and onwards errors out with no variable named "dependency"

**atalwar-sephora** commented *Oct 2, 2022*

I am trying to upgrade terragrunt from version 0.28.12 to latest but seems there are some breaking change from 0.28.12 to 0.39.0. Therefore I started upgrading version by version checking all the changelogs. 
The `terragrunt plan` works well till version 0.33.2 but as soon as I upgrade to version 0.34.0 and above I start getting below error on plan
```
terragrunt.hcl:64,28-38: Unknown variable; There is no variable named "dependency"., and 1 other diagnostic(s) 
ERRO[0000] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1 
```
I noticed that there are some breaking changes from v0.35.0 but that is on `dependencies` I am not using `dependencies` rather using `dependency` block. 

My terragrunt.hcl looks like below:

```
terraform {
  source = "<module_source>"
}

include {
  path = "${find_in_parent_folders()}"
}

dependency "cert" {
  config_path = "../certificate"
  mock_outputs = {
    this_certificate_arn = ""
  }
}

dependency "svc" {
  config_path = "../svc"
}

dependency "network" {
  config_path = "../netwrok"
}

dependency "user" {
  config_path = "${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/../user"
}

dependency "dns" {
  config_path = "${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/dns"
}

dependency "registry" {
  config_path = "${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/../registry"
}
```
PS: I tried giving a label to include block as well. Still same issue.

Hi,
from posted HCL file I don't see any issue, it may be caused from included HCL file or used dependencies
* try upgrading to `v0.38.5` or later to get the source file from where error occurs
* try running Terragrunt with `--terragrunt-log-level debug` to get more insights about processed files

@denis256 
Thanks for your response. 
I tried running with debug, but did not help much, however giving a closer look to the error, I noticed that the error is not from the the hcl file that I shared but from the root hcl file which defines the common provider and common variables config.
Checking the file in question I found that I have below structure:

```
terraform {
  extra_arguments "common_vars" {
    commands = get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars()

    optional_var_files = [
      "${find_in_parent_folders("account.tfvars", "skip-account-if-does-not-exist")}",
      "${find_in_parent_folders("region.tfvars", "skip-region-if-does-not-exist")}",
      "${find_in_parent_folders("env.tfvars", "skip-env-if-does-not-exist")}",
      "${find_in_parent_folders("common.tfvars", "skip-common-if-does-not-exist")}",
      "${get_terragrunt_dir()}/terraform.tfvars"
    ]
  }
}

generate "common_variables" {
  path      = "common_variables.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  contents  = file("${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/../../common/common_variables.tf")
}

generate "common_providers" {
  path      = "common_providers.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  contents  = file("${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/../../common/common_providers.tf")
}

dependency "org" {
  config_path = "${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/../_global/org"
}

remote_state {
  // remote_state config
  //
}

inputs = {
  account_id = dependency.org.outputs.id
}

 iam_role = "arn:aws:iam::${dependency.org.outputs.id}:role/terragrunt"

```

In above config, if you notice `role` is out of all the blocks and that is where it was erroring out. I moved it to `input` block and it worked but I wonder how this was working with versions `< 0.33.2`

Hi,
I need to dig more but I think handling of undeclared variables improved over versions...
Maybe the intention was to use `iam_role`? https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#iam_role

Hi @denis256 
yes it is `iam_role` I think I edited it while pasting the code. (edited it [above](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/2298#issuecomment-1265619247))

I think there was some fix for the similar issue in version `0.35.1` https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.35.1. on `iam_role` causing issues with dependency, but I am not able to figure our the what change is needed.

So, the setup work well if I hard code the account_id in` iam_role = "arn:aws:iam::${dependency.org.outputs.id}:role/terragrunt"` but with dependecy it does not work. 

I tried running this with `0.36.12`, `0.35.2` it fails with same error

PS: looks like there is already issue raised for this https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1870 and seems there is a PR being worked on https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1840 Can you confirm if this is the same issue?

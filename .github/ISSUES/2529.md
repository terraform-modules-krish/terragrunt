# Enhancement request: TERRAGRUNT_INCLUDE_MODULE_PREFIX strip pwd

**bushong1** commented *Apr 14, 2023*

It would be great if there were an option to strip the `pwd` from the output of `TERRAGRUNT_INCLUDE_MODULE_PREFIX=1`.  It's great that now we can read the terraform output and easily figure out which module is running, but for systems that have a deep directory structure, it's easy for the output to get spammed across the terminal since it lists the whole `pwd`.

```
[/home/charles/working/customer/my-project-name/my-infrastructure-directory/some-subdirectory/this-environment/terraform-module-1] 
[/home/charles/working/customer/my-project-name/my-infrastructure-directory/some-subdirectory/this-environment/terraform-module-1] Initializing the backend...
[/home/charles/working/customer/my-project-name/my-infrastructure-directory/some-subdirectory/this-environment/terraform-module-1]  
[/home/charles/working/customer/my-project-name/my-infrastructure-directory/some-subdirectory/this-environment/terraform-module-2/submodule] 
[/home/charles/working/customer/my-project-name/my-infrastructure-directory/some-subdirectory/this-environment/terraform-module-2/submodule] Initializing the backend...
[/home/charles/working/customer/my-project-name/my-infrastructure-directory/some-subdirectory/this-environment/terraform-module-2/submodule] 
```

It would be great it the output were configurable to be just:
```
[./terraform-module-1] 
[./terraform-module-1] Initializing the backend...
[./terraform-module-1]  
[./terraform-module-2/submodule] 
[./terraform-module-2/submodule] Initializing the backend...
[./terraform-module-2/submodule] 
```

I came here to request the same!

Bump!

This gist https://gist.github.com/antonbabenko/675049186e54b770b4789886d2056639#file-bash_profile attempts to do that, but doesn't completely work for me.

Also, it feels like this should be a native terragrunt cli implementation.

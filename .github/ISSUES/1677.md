# ctrl-c to abort doesn't seem to be handled properly

**queglay** commented *May 17, 2021*

If in the middle of a terragrunt apply, ctrl-c to abort might show a response in the current module, but it doesn't seem to handle this request too well- other modules appear to continue on their way.  This makes it difficult to know what to do after this point, as pressing ctrl-c multiple times may cause terraform to exit ungracefully.

terragrunt version v0.28.16

Are you having issues with `CTRL+C` and Terragrunt in general or specifically with `run-all`?

ctrl+c with terragrunt run-all.  In single modules it is fine.

Got it. Sounds like a bug then. We are buried for now, so if someone has time to dig in, a PR to fix this is very welcome.

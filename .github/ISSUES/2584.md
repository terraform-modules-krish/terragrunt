# How to fix provider plugin inconsistency due to .terraform.lock.hcl

**ankitcharolia** commented *May 30, 2023*

Hi Team,

I have enabled terragrunt caching in my setup. (root `terragrunt.hcl`)
```
terraform {
  before_hook "before_cache" {
    commands = [get_terraform_command()]
    execute  = ["mkdir", "-p", abspath("${get_repo_root()}/.terragrunt-cache/plugins")]
  }
  extra_arguments "terragrunt_plugins" {
    commands = [get_terraform_command()]
    env_vars = {
      TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR = abspath("${get_repo_root()}/.terragrunt-cache/plugins")
    }
  }
}
download_dir = "${get_repo_root()}/.terragrunt-cache"
```
Locally from my machine, **this commands WORKS perfectly fine**,
```
terragrunt run-all init -upgrade
terragrunt run-all plan/apply
```

,but I get the following **error** while running **gitlab-ci pipeline**
```
│ Error: Required plugins are not installed
│ 
│ The installed provider plugins are not consistent with the packages
│ selected in the dependency lock file:
│   - registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/google: the cached package for registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/google 4.66.0 (in .terraform/providers) does not match any of the checksums recorded in the dependency lock file
```

I understand that there are two `.terraform.lock.hcl` file with different hashes 
1. `.terragrunt-cache/XXXXX/cloud-storage/.terraform.lock.hcl` (from terragrunt-cache folder )
2. `infrastructure/live/cloud-storage/.terraform.lock.hcl`

and that gives this error: `The installed provider plugins are not consistent with the packages selected in the dependency lock file:`

**My question:**
Is there a way to workaround this issue for gitlab-ci pipeline ? or could we have a override functionality for `.terraform.lock.hcl` file ?


Thanks,
<br />

Hello,
I wanted to clarify if the same platform is used in local environment and in Gitlab CI - if platforms are different, providers checksum will be different


Can be attempted to use hooks to lock providers, like:

```
  # providers
  before_hook "providers" {
    commands     = ["providers"]
    execute      = ["rm", ".terraform.lock.hcl"]
    run_on_error = false
  }

  # init
  after_hook "init" {
    commands     = ["init"]
    execute      = ["rm", ".terraform.lock.hcl"]
    run_on_error = false
  }

  after_hook "lock_providers" {
    commands     = ["init"]
    execute      = ["terraform", "providers", "lock", "-platform=linux_amd64", "-platform=darwin_amd64"]
    run_on_error = false
  }
```

@denis256 : your hint helped me to fix the issue. Thank you.
I added the following `after_hook`, this fixes `.gitlab-ci.yml` pipeline.

```
  after_hook "lock_providers" {
    commands     = ["init"]
    execute      = ["terraform", "providers", "lock", "-platform=linux_amd64"]
    run_on_error = false
  }
  after_hook "init_copy_back_lockfile" {
    commands     = ["init"]
    execute      = ["cp", ".terraform.lock.hcl", "${get_terragrunt_dir()}"]
    run_on_error = false
  }
  ```

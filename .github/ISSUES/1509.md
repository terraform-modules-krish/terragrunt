# Terragrunt action ONLY on current node and all successors?

**trallnag** commented *Jan 22, 2021*

Is it possible to perform an action like `plan` or `apply` with Terragrunt that only affects the current node and all successors but not predecessors without relying on a strictly hierarchical directory structure?

Take a look at the following graph. Node 2 has changed. Now I want to run a plan /  apply on Node 2 and everything that depends on it. This would be 5, 6, and 4.

```
.
└── 0
    ├── 1
    ├── 2
    ├── 3
    ├── 4
    ├── 5
    └── 6
```

From what I understand I have the following options:

1. Perform the actions in every folder separately. But with that I have to keep track of the right order.
2. Perform an `-all` action from the root folder. This will take care of the correct order, but will also trigger an action on all other nodes in the graph.
3. Perform an `-all` action from a subdirectory. This will only trigger actions on all subdirectories below the one I am in including itself.

The problem with option three is that this way I cannot have nodes that depend on more than one other node as I cannot model such dependencies with directories only.

I have read about `--terragrunt-include-external-dependencies`, though it seems like it would trigger all nodes (referring to the example above)?

At the moment, this is not something that is supported. That said, having first-class support for discovering which modules depend on the current one would be very valuable for the use case you outlined, plus other use cases, such as #299. So if anyone wants to implement either or both of these, we would very much welcome a PR!

In the meantime, [`--terragrunt-include-dir`](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli-options/#terragrunt-include-dir) and similar flags are the only workaround, but I recognize that's not nearly as nice as automatic dependency navigation.

I see. The command `graph-dependencies` already creates a full description of the graph tree in [DOT](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(GraphViz)). So technically one would just have to parse this dot file and create a plan for the Terraform actions. At least that's how I would script a quick and dirty solution for myself in Python.

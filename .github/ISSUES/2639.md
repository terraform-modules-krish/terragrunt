# Question: Unreadable module directory due to missing terragrunt cache 

**abillingsley** commented *Jul 14, 2023*

I am running into an issue where the  terragrunt-cache is incomplete.  For reasons specific to the project, we'd like to have effectively two module directories (something like below).  In some cases a module in `/modulesB` may depend on a module in `/modulesA`.  This works fine with terraform but fails with terragrunt with the following error

> Unreadable module directory
> Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules: no such file or directory

```
live/
  dev/
     app/
        terragrunt.hcl
src/
  /modulesA
      /terraformModule1
          ...
  /modulesB
     /terraformModule2
         ...
```

/live/dev/app/terragrunt.hcl might look something like
```
terraform {
  source = "../../../src/moduleB//terraformModule2"
}

inputs = {
  ....
}
```

/src/modulesB/terraformModule2 may contain code like
```
module "terraformModule1" {
  source = "../../modulesA//terraformModule1"

  ...
}
```

I am finding that the terragrunt cache only includes modules in `moduleB` even though modules in moduleB may depend on things in moduleA.  Is there a terragrunt setting that can give me more control over the modules that are cached or is there a way to ensure all dependencies in the module tree are cached?

realized this https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/2430 is the same issue I am encountering I will explore the suggestions in this discussion

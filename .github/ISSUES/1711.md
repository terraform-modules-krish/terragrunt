# Failed to decode current backend config when upgrading terraform v0.12.31 to v0.13.5

**scottb-isp** commented *Jun 9, 2021*

I'm attempting to upgrade from `terraform v0.12.31` to `v0.13.5` and I ran into trouble with my backend shared state.

When running `terragrunt init` in a folder that has been working with `terraform v0.12.31` I get the following output

```
Initializing the backend...
Backend configuration changed!

Terraform has detected that the configuration specified for the backend
has changed. Terraform will now check for existing state in the backends.


Error: Failed to decode current backend config

The backend configuration created by the most recent run of "terraform init"
could not be decoded: unsupported attribute "lock_table". The configuration
may have been initialized by an earlier version that used an incompatible
configuration structure. Run "terraform init -reconfigure" to force
re-initialization of the backend.

[terragrunt] 2021/06/09 09:53:54 Hit multiple errors:
exit status 1
```

I downloaded my s3 state files and I don't see a `backend` block in the tfstate file anywhere. I was going to share its contents here but I can't find it.

In my root `terragrunt.hcl` I have the following declared

```
remote_state {
    backend = "s3"
    config = {
        bucket = local.tf_ss_name
        key = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
        region = "us-west-2"
        encrypt = true
        s3_bucket_tags = {
            ... etc ...
        }

        dynamodb_table = local.tf_ss_name
        dynamodb_table_tags = {
            ... etc ...
        }
    }
}
```

My issue was a bug related to the locally cached `.terragrunt-cache` folder.

I deleted the folder and the `terragrunt init` completed successfully...

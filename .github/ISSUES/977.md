# --terragrunt-include-dir broken with v0.20.5

**msvechla** commented *Dec 16, 2019*

Hi, I think [this PR](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/917) broke the behaviour of `--terragrunt-include-dir`. For me it still works with v0.20.5 and the flag is broken with the next version, which includes the PR.

example log:

```
terragrunt plan-all --terragrunt-include-dir **/*/tf-mod-aws-guardduty

```

As you can see I specified the `--terragrunt-include-dir` flag, however the logs show `excluded: true`

Hi @msvechla , you need to use this pattern to match the subdirectories. : `**/*/tf-mod-aws-guardduty/*`. As the [release notes](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.21.0) state, the pattern now works as a true glob pattern instead of using `string.Contains`.

Thanks a lot my bad, I got confused with the recent changes. However i think it should actually be `--terragrunt-include-dir "**/*/tf-mod-aws-guardduty/*"` as otherwise some files will be treated as additional arguments to the cli.

Thanks for pointing me in the right direction and sorry for the false issue!

# Terragrunt does not cleanup all files in work directory

**marcoreni** commented *May 24, 2018*

We are currently using terraform archive_file ( https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/archive/d/archive_file.html ) to create a zip file that is used within Lambda, using some resources found inside the component source dir.

We found out that if we delete some files from our component, the file is still in the zip.

According to the terragrunt logs, terragrunt only deletes *.tf files inside the working directory, so I'm guessing the old files are not deleted and are therefore zipped.

Is this by design? How can we cleanup all files inside working dir?

Right now we are working with a single repository and components are included like this:
```
terragrunt = {
  terraform {
    source = "../../../../components//my-lambda"
  }

  # Include all settings from the root terraform.tfvars file
  include = {
    path = "${find_in_parent_folders()}"
  }
}
```

It is by design: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/cli/download_source.go#L319-L322.

That said, the design can be changed :)

It might make sense to delete all files in the directory, other than the `.terraform` folder... I'd welcome a PR for that.

In the meantime, you can force Terragrunt to delete the entire temp folder using the `--terragrunt-source-update` flag.

The PR wouldn't be hard (apart from testing, I'm not familiar with Go, but I can give it a look in spare time...), but I don't know if deleting all files except `.terraform/*` could cause issues in some specific cases. Since everything is copied back on each terragrunt operation, I suppose not. 

Am I right?

I've found that it's hard to predict these sorts of things :) 

I _think_ it's safe to delete everything but `.terraform` in that tmp folder, and we should probably do that, but... I could be wrong. In which case, someone will file a bug, and we'll figure out some way to fix it.

# Question: How to use folder-based state key local testing with run-all?

**ddvdozuki** commented *Sep 6, 2021*

My question is, how do I allow multiple states by using directory keys in the same way with a multi-module run as I could with a single large module? 

This is my directory structure:

* modules
  * terragrunt.hcl
  * vpc
    * main.tf
    * terragrunt.hcl 
    * ...
  * eks
    * main.tf
    * terragrunt.hcl 
    * ...
  * storage
    * main.tf
    * terragrunt.hcl 
    * ...
  * app
    * main.tf
    * terragrunt.hcl 
    * ...

And the top level terragrunt.hcl file:
```hcl
remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    bucket         = "terraform-state-${get_aws_account_id()}"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-lock"
    key            = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    encrypt        = true
  }
}

# Configure input values for the specific environment being deployed:
inputs = {
  region = "us-east-1"
  ...
}
```

`app` module terragrunt.hcl file, all the others are similar just with different dependencies:
```hcl
# Pull in the backend and provider configurations from a root terragrunt.hcl file that you include in each child terragrunt.hcl:
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

dependency "vpc" {
  config_path = "../vpc"

  mock_outputs = {
    vpc_id = "temporary-dummy-id"
    azs_count = 3
  }
  mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands = ["validate"]
}
dependency "eks" {
  config_path = "../eks"

  mock_outputs = {
    eks_cluster_id = "dummy-cluster-id"
    eks_cluster_access_role_arn = "dummy-arn"
    nlb_dns_name = "dummy-lb-dns"
    cluster_primary_sg = "dummy-sg"
  }
  mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands = ["validate"]
}
dependency "storage" {
  config_path = "../storage"

  mock_outputs = {
    primary_db_secret = "dummy-secret-id"
    guide_images_bucket = "dummy-images-bucket"
    guide_objects_bucket = "dummy-objects-bucket"
    documents_bucket = "dummy-documents-bucket"
    guide_pdfs_bucket = "dummy-pdfs-bucket"
    memcached_cluster_address = "dummy-memcache"
  }
  mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands = ["validate"]
}

inputs = {
  vpc_id = dependency.vpc.outputs.vpc_id
  azs_count = dependency.vpc.outputs.azs_count

  eks_cluster_id = dependency.eks.outputs.eks_cluster_id
  eks_cluster_access_role_arn = dependency.eks.outputs.eks_cluster_access_role_arn
  nlb_dns_name = dependency.eks.outputs.nlb_dns_name
  cluster_primary_sg = dependency.eks.outputs.cluster_primary_sg

  primary_db_secret = dependency.storage.outputs.primary_db_secret
  s3_images_bucket = dependency.storage.outputs.guide_images_bucket
  s3_objects_bucket = dependency.storage.outputs.guide_objects_bucket
  s3_documents_bucket = dependency.storage.outputs.documents_bucket
  s3_pdfs_bucket = dependency.storage.outputs.guide_pdfs_bucket
  memcached_cluster_address = dependency.storage.outputs.memcached_cluster_address
}
```

So If I run `terragrunt run-all apply` in the `modules` directory I get a state key that looks like `modules/terraform.tfstate`. If I want to have multiple environments what I used to do with a single large module is simply create a directory outside the modules directory like so:

* live
  * terragrunt.hcl
  * qa
    * terragrunt.hcl

The outside terragrunt.hcl:
```hcl
remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    bucket         = "terraform-state-${get_aws_account_id()}"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-lock"
    key            = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    encrypt        = true
  }
}
```
and the terragrunt.hcl inside the `qa` directory:
```hcl
# Pull in the backend and provider configurations from a root terragrunt.hcl file that you include in each child terragrunt.hcl:
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

# Set the source to an immutable released version of the infrastructure module being deployed:
terraform {
  source = "/path/to/single//module"
}

# Configure input values for the specific environment being deployed:
inputs = {
  region = "us-east-1"
 ...
}
```

and from inside the `qa` directory I would run `terragrunt apply` and get a state with a key of `qa/terraform.tfstate` which would allow me to have multiple environments with the same terraform.

This seems to be very difficult if not impossible with multiple modules. I tried re-creating the same folder structure and pointing to modules directory inside the terraform source directive. I even tried re-creating the module structure inside the live directory and having the same stubbed terragrunt.hcl files inside but it didn't read the dependencies. When I went a step further and copied the dependencies over it just puked with a confusing error that made it seem clear it was not loading the correct terragrunt.hcls. 

So before I tear my hair out trying to make this work I thought it was worth a shot to ask the experts if there is a best practice here or some way I can achieve what I want without requiring a literal copy of the terraform files into multiple directories (which is kinda where I'm headed now).

Thank you.

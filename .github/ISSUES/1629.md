# Upgrade SOPS to 1.7.0 to support AWS Single-Sign On credentials

**michelzanini** commented *Apr 2, 2021*

**Context**
Versions:
terraform: v0.14.6
terragrunt: v0.28.18


**Description**
**AWS Single Sign-On** is supported from Terrafrom 0.14.6+, AWS provider 3.26.0+ and Terragrunt 0.28.9+ and AWS CLI v2.

This is all working great, **except** when using SOPS from Terragrunt, like below:

**secrets.yaml**
```
username: ENC[*username*]
password: ENC[*password*]
sops:
    kms:
    -   arn: *kms_arn*
        created_at: '2021-02-19T17:23:37Z'
        enc: *enc*
        aws_profile: development
    gcp_kms: []
    azure_kv: []
    hc_vault: []
    lastmodified: '2021-02-19T17:23:39Z'
    mac: *mac*
    pgp: []
    unencrypted_suffix: _unencrypted
    version: 3.6.1
```

terragrunt.hcl
```
# Load secrets if they are present
secret_vars = try(yamldecode(sops_decrypt_file("secrets.yaml")), {})
```

It should work as I am using a AWS profile for SOPS, called `development`. 
It **DOES** work if this profile is configured on `~/.aws/credentials` (no SSO, CLI v1):

```
[development]
aws_access_key_id=*aws_access_key_id*
aws_secret_access_key=*aws_secret_access_key*
aws_session_token=*aws_session_token*
```

But when I switched to use Single-Sign On with `~/.aws/config` (with SSO, CLI v2):

```
[profile development]
sso_start_url = https://*domain*.awsapps.com/start
sso_region = eu-west-1
sso_account_id = *sso_account_id*
sso_role_name = AdministratorAccess
```

I get this error:

```
Error: Error in function call

  on /Users/user/git/terragrunt-infrastructure/development/terragrunt.hcl line 15, in locals:
  15:   secret_vars = yamldecode(sops_decrypt_file("secrets.yaml"))

Call to function "sops_decrypt_file" failed: Error getting data key: 0 successful groups required, got 0.
```

It was obvious that sops does not support AWS Single-Sign On.

But then I saw that **SOPS 1.7.0 supports Single-Sign On now**:
See here https://github.com/mozilla/sops/pull/823 (released on 1.7.0).

I have tested on the command line with 1.6.1 and 1.7.0 with:

```
sops secrets.yaml
```

Does NOT work with 1.6.1, but with 1.7.0 it **does**.

I see Terragrunt depends on Sops 1.5.0. 
**For Single-Sign On to be supported and fixed we would need to upgrade the SOPS Go dependency to 1.7.0.**

Thanks.

I also look forward to sops 1.7.0 support that comes with 'age' encryption (from sops read-me: age is a simple, modern, and secure tool for encrypting files. It's recommended to use age over PGP, if possible.)

Just tested this with release 0.28.22 where #1564 has been released and works like a charm! :)
Closing this now. Thanks.

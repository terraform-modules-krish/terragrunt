# Terragrunt destroy dependency check including outside configuration

**jlepere-everlaw** commented *Jul 18, 2022*

The purview of the feature added from https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/299 feels too broad. Do we really want to be checking **every** `terragrunt.hcl` file in the git repo when running `destroy` commands?

The issue I'm running into is that `locals` are being evaluated for every `terragrunt.hcl` file. For my configuration, this includes a `run_cmd` that calls a script to package terraform code into s3 and return the path to be used as the `terraform` source. It doesn't really make sense to do this for **every** `terragrunt.hcl` my organization has defined when trying to destroy a particular terragrunt module. Also, the `run_cmds` are failing because an environment variable the script depends on isn't set, for some reason, although it is set before calling `terragrunt`.

Would it be worth adding a way to skip this functionality by default? Maybe a configuration attribute to turn the functionality off or a cli option to turn it on if it's off by default?

Hi,
can be an option to add feature flags to change the default behavior

Facing a similar issue where a run_cmd command is executed for every project in a repo with a lot of projects. This really slows down the execution of the destroy command. Having a way to turn it off would be useful.


P.S. ended up doing `terragrunt plan -destroy -out tf.plan; terragrunt apply tf.plan` as a workaround.

This is also an issue for us. In our case, we have separate directories for dev and prod environments and evaluating locals everywhere results in calls to an external service in the other environment which it doesn't have active credentials for.

We're using @velkovb 's workaround for now, but it would be good to be able to disable this behavior.

# Auto init should handle backend reconfiguration

**yorinasub17** commented *Jun 14, 2022*

When the backend configuration changes, `terragrunt` does not automatically run init again as this is not a covered case of [auto-init](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/auto-init/). 

This is a feature request to implement a feature to handle backend reconfigurations as part of the auto init process.

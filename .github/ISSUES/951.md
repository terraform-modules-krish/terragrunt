# prevent_destroy some resource

**erickellerek1** commented *Nov 13, 2019*

following the [documentation](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt#prevent_destroy)
I tried several construct with terragrunt to prevent one of my volume ressource to be destroyed.

in my terragrun.hcl file I tried to separate two `terraform { }` blocks one with modules to destroy and other with volume/db which should survive the destroy.

Unfortunatelly those are not allowed.
Neither are multiple `source=` keyword.

I also investigated into 2 other topics, generating on destroy the concrete target list using
```
arguments = [
      "-auto-approve"
      "${run_cmd("terraform", "state", "list", "|", "grep", "-v", "openstack_blockstorage_volume_v2", "|", "xargs", "-n1", "echo", "-target")}
```
and use something as `terraform state rm openstack_blockstorage_volume_v2` as a after hook

neither were working :(

Is there a concrete example of using this prevent_destroy on specific resources?
Also referring to the following terraform posts: https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/3874
 
Any idea how to achieve this with terragrunt as a super seed of terraform.

`prevent_destroy` is for a specific **module** and is not designed to handle a specific resource within a module:

> to protect selected **Terraform module**

For this use case, I would suggest extracting the volume to its own module so that it has its own state file, and then use `dependency` blocks in terragrunt to string together the dependencies to and from the volume. That way, you can destroy everything else in a `destroy-all`, but keep the volume using the `prevent_destroy` flag.

To clarify further, `terragrunt` is optimized at the module level. Meaning, the smallest unit that it is designed to handle is a single state file and not a resource (it relies on terraform for further granularity). You should be looking at terraform features when dealing with actions on elements within a state file, and looking at terragrunt features when dealing with actions on the whole state file or multiple state files.

This use case is for actions on elements within a state file, so terragrunt does not handle that. However, you can turn it into an action on multiple state files: hence, the suggestion above to break out the volume into its own module.

Thanks for the answer, I will give it a try. When you mean:
> extracting the volume to its own module (terragrunt)
This would be a second terragrunt.hcl file ?
```

```

The main terragrun.hcl point to `modules/os/` also including the volume part.
```
terraform {
  source = "${path_relative_from_include()}/../modules/os"
...
```
modules currently look like:
```
modules
└── os
    ├── backend.tf
    ├── main.tf
    ├── provider.tf
    └── var.tf
```
so you suggest to add a new module called: `modules/persistent/volume.tf` containing the volume code.

then have a second `persistent/terragrunt.hcl` refering the `modules/persistent/` as source.
```
terraform {
  source = "${path_relative_from_include()}/../modules/persistent"
...
}
prevent_destroy = true
```

with,
> and then use dependency blocks in terragrunt to string together the dependencies to and from the volume.

you mean have a dependency definition in the `code-page/terragrunt.hcl` and `code/terragrunt.hcl`
```
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}
dependencies {
  paths = ["../../persistent/"]
}
```
Will check this out and update this post

I actually mean the `dependency` block (https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt#passing-outputs-between-modules), so that you can access the outputs of the volume module to refer to it.

ok thanks I will give it a try tomorrow.

sorry for the delay of my response, definitively 15 days after tomorrow :(
I played a bit with the dependency block.

And encountered some issue with input variables not overwriting the default.

```
cat persistent/var.tf
variable "volume_size" {
  type = "string"
  default = "10"
}

```

```
cat persistent/main.tf
# Create persistent vol
resource "openstack_blockstorage_volume_v2" "vol" {
  name = "DATA-test"
  description = "Data Vol for test"
  size = var.volume_size
}
```

```
cat persistent/terragrunt.hcl
dependency "os" {
  config_path = "../os"
}
inputs = {
  volume_size = dependency.os.outputs.volume_size
}
```

```
cat os/main.tf
...
output "volume_size" {
  value = "${var.volume_size}"
}
...
```

the output displays the wished volume size but it seems that the input variable is not overwritten.
Additionally the dependency does not first create the vm instances to then create and attach the persistent volume...

in the end I get some error:
```
[terragrunt] 2019/11/28 21:36:59 Encountered the following errors:
Module is protected by the prevent_destroy flag in /home/eric/live/prod/persistent/terragrunt.hcl. Set it to false or delete it to allow destroying of the module.
[terragrunt] 2019/11/28 21:36:59 Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1
```

I did add some dependencies to these vm instance to fix the dependencies but this prevents me to destroy them.
```
cat live/prod/persistent/terragrunt.hcl
terraform {
  source = "${path_relative_from_include()}/../../../modules/persistent"
}
dependencies {
  paths = ["../code", "../code-page"]
}
prevent_destroy = true
```

results in the following error message:
```
Cannot process module Module /home/eric/live/prod/code-page (excluded: false, dependencies: []) because one of its dependencies, Module /home/eric/live/prod/persistent (excluded: false, dependencies: [/home/eric/live/prod/code, /home/eric/live/prod/code-page]), finished with an error: Module is protected by the prevent_destroy flag in /home/eric/live/prod/persistent/terragrunt.hcl. Set it to false or delete it to allow destroying of the module.
[terragrunt] 2019/11/28 21:43:45 Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1
```

Are there some example using the  prevent_destroy and the dependency construct in terragrunt?

> in the end I get some error:

The error is intentional. As indicated in the error message, it is telling you that you requested to destroy the module `persistent`, but terragrunt prevented you from destroying it because you have the `prevent_destroy` flag set to `true`.

However, this makes me realize that this is conflicting with your use case because `terragrunt` does not continue to destroy the dependent resources since it assumes it can't destroy those unless the parent is destroyed, and the parent can't be destroyed. I am not sure we want to change this behavior since it indeed does prevent you from shooting yourself in the foot.

Perhaps we can support a `warn_on_prevent_destroy` flag, although its uses are limited enough that I am not sure we want to support it.

A workaround here would be to take advantage of the folder structure so that the `persistent` module is in a different folder tree than the instances and `os` modules, so that you can run `destroy-all` at the level for the instances. For example:

```
.
├── node
│   ├── instance
│   │   ├── os
│   │   └── code
│   ├── volume
        └── persistent
```

This way, when you run `apply-all` in `node`, it will deploy everything but you can run `destroy-all` in `instance` to destroy everything but the volume.

> Are there some example using the prevent_destroy and the dependency construct in terragrunt?

We don't have any public examples that show those two in conjunction. Additionally, the examples we have address a completely different use case than here, where you want to intentionally destroy everything but those that have `prevent_destroy` set to `true`. Our examples address the use case where you want to avoid accidentally destroying certain resources with `prevent_destroy` when you run `destroy-all`.

Thanks for the explanation, I was able to make it work after some trial and errors.
I can post the implementation non some gist a bit later when it's cleaned up.

I did separate the modules into 2 directories:
* modules/os
* modules/volume

Then have a live/prod directory:
* code/
* code-page/
* volume/
* volume-page/

I had to define the `dependency` and `inputs` in the live/prod/{code,code-page} like following terragrunt.hcl file
```
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}
dependencies {
  paths = ["../volume"]
}
dependency "volume" {
  config_path = "../volume"
  mock_outputs = {
    volume_id = "temporary-dummy-id"
  }
}
inputs = {
  volume_id = dependency.volume.outputs.volume_id
}
```

the variables `volume_id` had to be defined in the respective module `modules/os/var.tf` consuming the dependency.

For the error message, I would argue that it shall be a "warning" message not an error. As I instruct the module to not be deleted meaning the return code shall be 0. or a flag like you mentioned `warn_on_prevent_destroy` would come handy.

Thanks again for your help.

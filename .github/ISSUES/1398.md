# Dependency output not working for local backend

**wberger** commented *Oct 22, 2020*

Hi,

I have a problem with retrieving outputs from a dependency using a local backend, and after lots of searching I believe it's a terragrunt issue.

Here's my configuration:

terragrunt version v0.23.40 (latest from Chocolatey)
Terraform v0.13.4
Plattform: Windows 10 (Powershell)

This is my directory structure:
```
terraform
|
|-environments
| |-dev
|   |-machine
|   | |-terragrunt.hcl
|   |-vpc
|   | |-terragrunt.hcl
|   |-terragrunt.hcl
|-modules
  |-machine
  |  |- main.tf
  |  |- outputs.tf
  |  |- vars.tf
  |-vpc
     |- main.tf
     |- outputs.tf
     |- vars.tf
```
vpc and machine define a local backend in their main.tf like this:
```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 3.0"
    }
  }
  backend "local" {}
}
```

The environments/dev/terragrunt.hcl contains these elements:
```
terraform {
  extra_arguments "common_vars" {
    commands = get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars()

    arguments = [
      "-var-file=${get_terragrunt_dir()}/../common.tfvars"
    ]
  }
}

remote_state {
  backend = "local"
  config = {
    path = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
  }
}

inputs = {
  ...
}
```
The environments/dev/vpc/terragrunt.hcl contains these elements:
```
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}
terraform {
  source = "../../../modules/vpc"
}
inputs = {
  ...
}
```
The environments/dev/machine/terragrunt.hcl contains these elements:
```
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}
dependency "vpc" {
  config_path = "../vpc"
}
terraform {
  source = "../../../modules/machine"
}
inputs = {
  some_var = dependency.vpc.outputs.some_output
  ...
}
```

I've applied the vpc successfully from the `environments/dev/vpc` directory. `terragrunt output` lists all outputs with values. However planning or applying the machine from the `environments/dev/machine` directory fails with the following output (paths partly redacted):

```

Either the target module has not been applied yet, or the module has no outputs. If this is expected, set the skip_outputs flag to true on the dependency block.
[terragrunt] 2020/10/22 12:16:12 Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1
```

As already said, vpc has already been applied and the outputs are indeed available. I believe the issue is located here:
```
[terragrunt] [somedir\terraform\environments\dev\vpc] 2020/10/22 12:16:12 Running command: terraform output -json
```
Terragrunt has not changed the working directory to the respective terragrunt-cache directory and runs **terraform output** instead of **terragrunt output** (as claimed in the documentation here: https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#dependency). Thus it is not able to find the .tfstate that is located in the respective terragrunt-cache directory.

As such I am currently not able to fetch outputs from the dependency.

Also having this issue.  
My workaround is to give an absolute path in the env's `terragrunt.hcl` file (your `environments/dev/terragrunt.hcl` file)

```hcl
remote_state {
  backend = "local"
  config = {
      path = "/tmp/local_tg/terraform.tfstate"
  }
}
```

Are you sure you're properly creating the `terraform.tfstate` files? Without them, there's no way to know the output.

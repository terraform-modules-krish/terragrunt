# dependencyBlocksToModuleDependencies does not resolve relative config_path values

**gnadaban** commented *Feb 10, 2021*

The `dependencyBlocksToModuleDependencies` function should resolve `config_path` values relative to the `terragrunt.hcl` file they are declared in instead of simply appending them to an array.

This becomes a problem during multi-level dependencies:

Terragrunt A has a dependency on Terragrunt B: A -> B
Terragrunt C has a dependency on Terragrunt A: C -> A

Eg. in my case:

`sqs/data-queue/terragrunt.hcl` depends on `sqs/deadletter-queue/terragrunt.hcl`
`lambda-function/terragrunt.hcl` depends on `sqs/data-queue/terragrunt.hcl`

Deploying the `sqs/data-queue/terragrunt.hcl` from its own directory properly finds the dependency.
This means, that in this case the path `get_terragrunt_dir()` gets resolved to `sqs/data-queue` as it should.

However, when I try to deploy `lambda-function/terragrunt.hcl` which depends on `sqs/data-queue/terragrunt.hcl`, I get an error:

```
[terragrunt] 2021/02/10 16:24:10 Terraform version: 0.13.5
[terragrunt] 2021/02/10 16:24:10 Reading Terragrunt config file at <redacted>/lambda-function/terragrunt.hcl
[terragrunt] 2021/02/10 16:24:10 Error reading file at path <redacted>/iam/sqs/deadletter-queue: open <redacted>/iam/sqs/deadletter-queue: no such file or directory
```

The interesting thing about the path in the log, is that it comes from `sqs/data-queue/terragrunt.hcl` where it is defined so:
```hcl
dependency "deadletter_queue" {
  config_path = abspath("${get_terragrunt_dir()}/../deadletter-queue")
}
```

I have also tried using `..` instead of the `get_terragrunt_dir()` function, with and without the `abspath` function.
These also don't work obviously, as there's no path resolution done in `dependencyBlocksToModuleDependencies`:

```go
func dependencyBlocksToModuleDependencies(decodedDependencyBlocks []Dependency) *ModuleDependencies {
	if len(decodedDependencyBlocks) == 0 {
		return nil
	}

	paths := []string{}
	for _, decodedDependencyBlock := range decodedDependencyBlocks {
		configPath := decodedDependencyBlock.ConfigPath
		if util.IsFile(configPath) && filepath.Base(configPath) == DefaultTerragruntConfigPath {
			// dependencies system expects the directory containing the terragrunt.hcl file
			configPath = filepath.Dir(configPath)
		}
		paths = append(paths, configPath)
	}
	return &ModuleDependencies{Paths: paths}
}
```

If this function would simply resolve the `configPath` values to canonical paths based on where the dependency is declared, it would not only work correctly, but the expected path would be self-explanatory from a developer point of view.

Oddly the examples in the docs here are using this non-working notation:
https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/keep-your-terragrunt-architecture-dry/

The dependency blocks:
```
dependency "vpc" {
  config_path = "../vpc"
}

dependency "mysql" {
  config_path = "../mysql"
}
```

that are moved to _env/app.hcl for added DRY'ness does not work unless changed to
```
dependency "vpc" {
  config_path = "${get_terragrunt_dir()}/../vpc"
}

dependency "mysql" {
  config_path = "${get_terragrunt_dir()}/../mysql"
}
```

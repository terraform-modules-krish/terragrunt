# get_aws_account_id failed if current credential are using cn partition

**Tiduster** commented *Oct 24, 2019*

Hi!

I am using the following adfs configuration:

```
[profile CHN]
region = cn-north-1
output = json
adfs_config.ssl_verification = True
adfs_config.role_arn = arn:aws-cn:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/ROLE
adfs_config.adfs_host = adfs.**
adfs_config.adfs_user = user@company.com
adfs_config.session_duration = 3600
adfs_config.provider_id = urn:amazon:webservices:cn-north-1
```

When I try to plan something using terragrunt:

```
$ AWS_PROFILE=CHN terragrunt plan --terragrunt-source-update --debug
[terragrunt] 2019/10/24 11:04:56 Reading Terragrunt config file at terraform/terraform-stacks/cn-north-1/gold/s3_buckets/terragrunt.hcl
[terragrunt] 2019/10/24 11:04:57 terraform/terraform-stacks/cn-north-1/gold/s3_buckets/terragrunt.hcl:40,62-81: Error in function call; Call to function "get_aws_account_id" failed: InvalidClientTokenId: The security token included in the request is invalid
	status code: 403, request id: **********************., and 3 other diagnostic(s)
[terragrunt] 2019/10/24 11:04:57 Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1
```

I think the issue here, is that terragrunt, via the `get_aws_account_id` function, is calling the regular aws, not the aws-cn. So, my token is rejected, and terragrunt failed.
AWS China is very slow, but the 403 is immediate, so for sure, he is not contacting the right endpoint.

I tried to find out how this function work, but I think terragrunt is simply using the go SDK.

I didn't find anywhere a "partition" setting to fix this issue.

Let me know if you need more information.

Regards,

Thanks for reporting. I suspect your analysis is correct. The implementation is [here](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/97a66d728ef3b31034601030b3bb148856a2f7a2/config/config_helpers.go#L307-L323). I believe when calling `session.NewSession()`, there is a way to override things such as region, endpoints, etc. PR to fix this issue is welcome!

Thanks for your input!
I followed the NewSession() function to this part of the documentation:

```
var DefaultConfig = &Config{
    Credentials:             DefaultChainCredentials,
    Endpoint:                "",
    Region:                  os.Getenv("AWS_REGION"),
    DisableSSL:              false,
    ManualSend:              false,
    HTTPClient:              http.DefaultClient,
    LogHTTPBody:             false,
    LogLevel:                0,
    Logger:                  os.Stdout,
    MaxRetries:              DefaultRetries,
    DisableParamValidation:  false,
    DisableComputeChecksums: false,
    S3ForcePathStyle:        false,
}
```
In my mind, as the SDK is suppose to be clever, only the Region setting was needed.
As it's not specified in the code of your function `getAWSCallerId`, it's using the default one: `os.Getenv("AWS_REGION")`

So, if I change my previous command for this one:

```
AWS_REGION=cn-north-1 AWS_PROFILE=CHN terragrunt plan --terragrunt-source-update --debug
```

It's now working perfectly.

So, what do you want me to do?

Solution 1)
Use this example to send the region when creating a new session:

```
// Create a Session with a custom region
sess, err := session.NewSession(&aws.Config{
	Region: aws.String("us-west-2"),
})
```
Solution 2)
Edit the documentation somewhere to ensure that every china (and gov) user uses the `AWS_REGION` variable?

Best regards,

Ah, nice investigation.

I don't think Terragrunt knows which region you want to use... So I don't think we can set it automatically in `NewSession`. Probably the easiest fix is to update the docs and mention` AWS_REGION` must be set for China, Gov, and other "special" AWS regions.

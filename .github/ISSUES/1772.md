# Terraform registry support: Support shorthand detector

**yorinasub17** commented *Aug 17, 2021*

Support a shorthand of `MODULE?version=VERSION` for the url instead of providing `tfr://` protocol. Example:

```
source = "hashicorp/consul/aws?version=3.5.0"
```

Note that this requires implementing a detector for the tfr protocol that is able to handle this, and make sure that it has precedence over the local file detector.

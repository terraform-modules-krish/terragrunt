# Interpolation in tfvars files causes issues even when escaping varables

**jessecollier** commented *Apr 23, 2018*

I would like to pass a template as a variable:
```
my_template = <<EOF
hello my name is ${name}
EOF
```

Yet using terragrunt I get the following:
```
[terragrunt] 2018/04/23 17:54:40 Invalid interpolation syntax. Expected syntax of the form '${function_name()}', but got '${name}'
```

I see this mentioned as a bug here:
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/139#issuecomment-283939341

Wondering if there is something we can do ?

Edit:
I've also tried escaping with double $ `$${name}`... still same issue

This is a bug where Terragrunt is processing interpolations outside of the `terragrunt = { ... }` block. Duplicate of #227.

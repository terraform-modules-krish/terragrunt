# Easy way to switch between terragrunt versions

**w32-blaster** commented *Nov 26, 2019*

Hi,

We are migrating our modules to the new terraform 0.12 version syntax, but because of the size of our code base to upgrade, we need a solution to switch between version numbers in case if we have to make changes on the old format before migrating to tf 0.12. 
For this we started to use tfenv which works great. Do we have something similar for terragrunt, or is there an easy way to switch between terragrunt versions?

There is a way.
You can the terraform 0.11 binary to something like `terraform-v11` and then use this in the parent`terragrunt.hcl` https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt#terraform_binary:
```
terraform_binary = "terraform-v11"
terraform_version_constraint = ">= 0.11"
```
And if a module is using the new code for terraform 0.12 you just set in in the terragrunt module `terragrunt.hcl`:
```
terraform_binary = "terraform"
```
Eventually `terraform_binary` will become redundant (as all of the code will have been converted to 0.12 syntax)

No, we don't have a utility like `tfenv` for `terragrunt`. I personally have set up `terragrunt11` for `terragrunt` versions < v0.19.0 and `terragrunt` for versions >=v0.19.0. Worked well for me during our module upgrade.

Make sure you have `version.tf` in your repo

```
$ cat versions.tf

terraform {
  required_version = ">= 0.12"
}
```

then run terraform/terragrunt command in container, especially with CICD pipeline, so you can fix the terraform and terragrunt version

such as

```
alpine/terragrunt:0.12.16
alpine/terragrunt:0.11.14
```

So “tgenv” or “tfenv” is not required

Thanks for the tgenv @brikis98 , it works well on local development.

# Manually generate auto-generated Terraform code when using terraform.tfvars module source.

**josh-padnick** commented *Apr 13, 2017*

Recently, I needed to help a Gruntwork customer debug an issue with why a Terraform template could no longer apply. They're using Terragrunt and shared with me the following output:

```
aws_iam_policy.manage_ebs_volume: Refreshing state... (ID: arn:aws:iam::111111111111:policy/jenkins-manage-ebs-volume-vol-0f9999999999999)
aws_iam_policy_attachment.attach_manage_ebs_volume: Refreshing state... (ID: attach-manage-ebs-volume)
Error refreshing state: 1 error(s) occurred:

* aws_lambda_function.scheduled_lambda_job_not_in_vpc: RequestError: send request failed
caused by: Get https://lambda.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2015-03-31/functions/jenkins-backup: dial tcp: lookup lambda.us-west-2.amazonaws.com on 127.0.0.1:53: read udp 127.0.0.1:58188->127.0.0.1:53: i/o timeout
```

It was a confusing error and we couldn't resolve it prima facie, so the next step is to keep simplifying the setup until we can explain why a simpler failure occurred. That, in turn, required that we use a native Terraform configuration that mimics the automated functionality of `terragrunt apply` in combination with a `terraform.tfvars` that copies a module to a temp directory.

But explaining how such a template should be structued to the client was still non-trivial, so it'd be nice if we had a `terragrunt generate` command (or something better named) that automatically outputs the Terraform code that Terragrunt internally generates for debugging situations like this one.

I'm not sure I fully understand what the `generate` command would do?

BTW, is there a reason you can't do the local testing using the `--terragrunt-source` parameter?

That mostly solves the problem, but for a true reproduction, it'd be nice if Terragrunt could "generate" the native Terraform equivalent of using `terragrunt.terraform.source` in `terraform.tfvars`.

Isn't that exactly what it does when you run, say, `terragrunt plan`? The contents of the tmp folder are that output...

Ah, I didn't make the connection that you could access that tmp folder even after `terragrunt plan` is run, and I suppose it's in the logs, too. Do you know if tmp files get deleted immediately after the terragrunt run finishes? If not, manually accessing the tmp folder solves the problem.

They do not get deleted, so you should be able to `cd` into that folder and use it as you wish.

Great, closing this issue. Thanks.

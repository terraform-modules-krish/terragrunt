# Implement imports RFC

**yorinasub17** commented *Feb 26, 2021*

https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/rfc/imports/

NOTE: In the RFC, we mention implementing `import` as a separate block. To expedite development, we recommend implementing it as part of `include` by enhancing its capability in backwards compatible ways.

Recommended phased implementation (expectation is that each of bullets is a separate PR):

1. [x] [[IMPLEMENTED](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1716)] Expose the underlying config values under a reference var. E.g., being able to say `include.foo.locals`.
     - This would replace `read_terragrunt_config`, and has the advantage of providing a way to solve #1128 because we have more control over when parsing happens during a block decode, than a function eval.

1. [x] [(a) [IMPLEMENTED](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1724) ; (b) [IMPLEMENTED](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1759)] Add the ability to configure the way included config merges. Right now `include` does an automatic shallow merge. In addition to shallow merge, user should have the ability to specify (a) no merge (full replacement for `read_terragrunt_config`), and (b) deep merge.

1. [x] [[IMPLEMENTED](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1759)]Add ability to configure the included config to automatically fetch and expose dependencies.

1. [X] [[IMPLEMENTED](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.32.0)]Add the ability to have multiple include blocks in one child config.

1. [ ] Add the ability to include multiple levels. Note that a potential yak shave is that this may break the include related functions, like `get_parent_terragrunt_folder` and `path_relative_to_include`. We will need to respecify how these work when multiple levels are included.

I see that this ticket has been marked as high priority and there are only 10 of those in total at the time of this comment so I believe it is one of the next few in the queue but do you have a general timeframe for this being implemented by chance @yorinasub17 ?

`high-priority` are tickets we'll try to prioritize internally at Gruntwork. We do not have a timeline on them.

First feature in the list is now implemented in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.30.4

**yorinasub17** commented *Jul 30, 2021*

Deep merge with cross include dependency reference support is now available: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.31.3

**yorinasub17** commented *Sep 14, 2021*

Multiple `include` blocks (**still single level**) is now supported starting https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.32.0

This feature should allow significantly more DRY `terragrunt` configs even without multiple `include` levels. Refer to the updated [use case documentation](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/keep-your-terragrunt-architecture-dry/) for more details.

@yorinasub17 what is the current status on adding the ability to include multiple levels? THX
***

**yorinasub17** commented *Nov 4, 2021*

@chrisurf It needs some more design cycles to think through what it would mean to the functions. That said, with multiple `include` support addressing a few core use cases of DRY Terragrunt, I don't think we are likely to implement it anytime soon.

@yorinasub17  Any news on nested includes?
We are evaluating Terragrunt to get our Terraform code DRY and when experimenting with different layouts, I always bumped against the restriction of not being able to have more levels of `include`, which IMO breaks the principle of getting the code DRY quite a bit.

**david-heward-unmind** commented *May 25, 2022*

i tend to agree with the above comment. single include level prevents breaking the parent into re-useable include blocks. including those blocks at a child level makes no sense since it would break DRY.

any chance we can get this moving?

Indeed, due to this limitation it does not seem to be possible to include anything in a root config at all, which is a problem. In fact, if we do

```terraform
include "root" {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}
```

as recommended in https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/keep-your-terragrunt-architecture-dry/, then there cannot be an include in _any_ of the parent folder configurations anymore.

Is this still being worked on?

@GergelyKalmar I recommend naming your root "root.hcl" (or anything else) and then doing
```hcl
include "root" {
  path = find_in_parent_folders("root.hcl")
}
```

the default parameter of the find_in_parent_folders function is "terragrunt.hcl" but the name of included files is arbitrary

**GergelyKalmar** commented *Jun 26, 2023*

I'm not sure if that helps, from what I understand the limitation is that only a single level of includes is allowed. It does not matter what the root config is called, you will still get an error if there is any other include anywhere else.

Hi. Any updates on this development? Is it still being pursued? Thanks

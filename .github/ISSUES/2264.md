# Allow `error_hook` to cause the module to succeed on error

**geekofalltrades** commented *Sep 1, 2022*

It would be useful to have `error_hook` be a true error handler than can decide whether a given error is acceptable.

For example, we have a `vault` module that deploys HashiCorp Vault. It uses an external data source to init vault and return the root token. We then have a separate `vault_config` module that uses that root token to install configuration in Vault using a Vault provider whose token is configured with `dependency.vault.outputs.root_token` via a `generate` block.

If we are running `destroy` on the `vault_config` module, but the `vault` module has already been destroyed, then there is no root token, and the `vault_config` module will error out trying to configure the provider. But this is an expected error, and we shouldn't fail an entire `run-all destroy` because of it. After all, Vault is already destroyed, and `vault_config` may already have succeeded in being destroyed once.

An intuitive way to achieve this would be to have an `error_hook` exit with code zero if the run should succeed (error was handled) or exit nonzero if the run should fail (error could not be handled). But, this would be a breaking change that would make all existing user `error_hook` configurations behave differently. It would also be useful to have the error code that the run failed with passed on to the `error_hook`, maybe in an environment variable, so that the hook could exit with that code if it couldn't handle the error.

The simplest handlers could mark acceptable errors like so:

```hcl
terraform {
  error_hook "acceptable" {
    commands  = ["destroy"]
    execute   = ["true"]
    on_errors = ["match any error that shouldn't fail the run"]
  }
}
```

# [Question]Â How can we access data from terraform module inside a terragrunt hcl file ?

**axelczk** commented *Aug 4, 2022*

Here is my hcl file:

```
terraform {
  source = "git@...."
}

locals = {
  config  = templatefile("./config.yml", { environment = {NEED HELP HERE } )]])
}

```

Inside the terraform module, I have a data that retrieve a value from our cloud provider. I would like to know if it is possible to use this data in order to file the variable required inside the templatefile ?
The only solution I have is to use an run_cmd in order to reproduce the behavior of the data block in the module.

Thanks for your help,

Have a great day.

Hi,
I was thinking about usage of `dependency` and `outputs` field


```
# terragrunt.hcl
dependency "module" {
  # module where Terraform code is defined
  config_path = "../module"


  mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands = ["validate"]
  mock_outputs = {
    file_name = "test"
  }
}

inputs = {
  value = dependency.module.outputs.file_name
}

```

```
# main.tf
variable "value" {
  type = string
}
resource "local_file" "file" {
  content     = var.value
  filename = "${path.module}/txt.txt"
}

```

This is not what I really want in fact. But I think it's not possible. 

In fact, the hcl file I linked in the issue is used to manage dependency for the module between multiple others modules. This is why I was asking it the parent could use data from the terraform source but I don't think it's possible regarding your response.

I will use an run_cmd like I already did. It was just to find out if there was a better way to do it.

@axelczk -- I'm going to close this issue since it sounds like you got things working.

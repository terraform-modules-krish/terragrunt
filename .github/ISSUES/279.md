# Using init for downloading code is slow with Terraform 0.10.x

**brikis98** commented *Aug 31, 2017*

Terragrunt uses `init` to download remote configurations. As of Terraform 0.10.x, the `init` command now initializes plugins. This makes the call to `init` fairly slow, especially as we call it for _every single command_ if your `source` URL is a local file path. Note that if you set `-get-plugins=false`, then the call to `init` fails, as Terraform will see that plugins are necessary, but you're not downloading them.

Consider using some other mechanism to download code, at least in the local file path case (where a simple `cp` will probably do the trick), which doesn't rely on `init` and force you to wait for plugin initialization every single time.

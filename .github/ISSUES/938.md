# Terragrunt and terraform SAAS

**gurdeepsira** commented *Oct 31, 2019*

Hi All,
Can terragrunt work with Terraform cloud? I use the latter for state storage.
I'm also using atlantis.


Thanks

There are a few known bugs with using Terraform cloud, specifically https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/929 and https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/779.

# unable to import pre-existing s3 bucket

**b3nnb** commented *Sep 25, 2020*

So first, i know im behind on the versions, i have to do this to be able to update everything all at once.
running 
terragrunt 0.18.7
terrafrom 0.11.14

and trying to import a pre-existing s3 bucket with 

`terragrunt import aws_s3_bucket.module_bucket_name bucket_to_import`

and im getting 

```
Did not find any Terraform files (*.tf) in ............... aws_s3_bucket.module_bucket_name
```
any advice? im hoping im missing something small

my file structure is 
```
- project
    - dev
        - config
    - prod
        - config
-modules
    - module
```

Could you share see your `terragrunt.hcl` files and the full log output?
***

**b3nnb** commented *Sep 29, 2020*

you mean the tfvars files in the live project repo of the structure?

Sorry for the delay.

What is in `matillion`?

Right, but what is in that project? Because the code you showed is going to `clone` that project and try to run Terragrunt/Terraform in the `matillion` folder, so whatever error you're getting is most likely related to what's in that folder.
***

**b3nnb** commented *Nov 12, 2020*

Its everything from an ALB to instances, IAM policies, and a bunch of stuff that's been successfully deployed. And I just added this s3 bucket manually, then added the code for it in this module but can't import it.

Sorry if that's not helpful. Im not sure how to answer that
***

**brikis98** commented *Nov 12, 2020*

Hm, the log output shows:

```
/Users/MyUser/Documents/code-repo/terraform-infra/terraform-biztech_live/bi/dev/matillion/.terragrunt-cache/2GNCiwHeWw3NWmw09ueMMSaORU8/Dk3vJCkbUgoeM-kj-hrDkhmCvu8/aws_s3_bucket.import_bucket
```

Why  is it running in the folder `aws_s3_bucket.import_bucket` instead of `matillion`? Is there something else in the config I'm not seeing? What is the full command you are running on the CLI?
***

**b3nnb** commented *Nov 12, 2020*

Oh I get ya. The command I run has is just terragrunt import and then the details of the s3 bucket. Im guessing im doing something incorrect. Im just trying to treat terragrunt as a wrapper and subbing terraform for terragrunt to get a resource imported
***

**brikis98** commented *Nov 13, 2020*

Could you copy/paste the _exact_ command you're running? E.g., I see in the logs that there is a `--terragrunt-source-update` flag set, but that wasn't in your original message. Seeing the whole command you're running would help troubleshoot this.
***

**b3nnb** commented *Nov 29, 2020*

Ok so i got it sorted out.
The command i was running was this.
`terragrunt import --terragrunt-source ~/Documents/code-repo/terraform-infra/modules/matillion/ aws_s3_bucket.bucket matillion-dev`

but the issue was in my provider resource
```
provider "aws" {
  region = "${local.region}"
}
```
if i change tis to a hardcoded value it works for the import. then i can change it back and everything that wa simported still works fine.

is this normal? that you have to hardcode that value? It works fine when running terragrunt plan && apply

Ah, you may be hitting a Terraform `import` bug: https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/13018 or https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26211. Hard-coding is, sadly, the workaround. We actually built a hacky command into Terragrunt to work around this `import` bug: https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli-options/#aws-provider-patch.

Just to be familiar in case you're not, there's this project which can help you to import pre existing stuff to terraform with state file https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/terraformer.
I've tested it for s3 with 0.12.20 and it work like a charm

**b3nnb** commented *Jan 5, 2021*

Ya, i used something like that. (or that exact one) years ago but it only exported the resources into terraform code and didnt import to the state file. looks like it has come a long way. thanks for the tip!!

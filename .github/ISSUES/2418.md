# Upgrade TFLint to latest version (v0.44.1)

**theurichde** commented *Jan 16, 2023*

Hello together!

I would like to have the latest `tflint` version ([v0.44.1](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint/releases/tag/v0.44.1)) available in terragrunt. The currently used one is [v0.42.2](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint/releases/tag/v0.42.2) from Oct 25, 2022.

I would also like to take this issue directly and implement the update.

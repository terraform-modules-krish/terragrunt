Hello,
will be helpful to get more details on how is intended to use terragrunt in this case - it is to be used in an "offline" environment, without internet access?

I have my own use case and it shouldn't matter. That is why terraform has this feature.. Terragrunt is advertised that all terraform sub commands work so please fix this sub command so it works

Hello, I'm also curious about this feature. I need to use Terragrunt in an envrionment with very strict security posturing which blocks most external hosts including hashicorp provider sources.

Make sure to specify an absolute directory, otherwise, it will mirror the providers into the Terragrunt cache directory.

# Support for relative path modules within modules

**johnbarney** commented *Apr 21, 2021*

I began a project to refactor some of my Terraform code into modules as I found I was repeating myself quite a bit for common resources such as Lambda. So I refactored this into a "submodule" that the main modules invoke. After doing all of that work I realized the "init" step for Terragrunt takes place after the Terraform folder has been moved to the cache location, causing the relative path to my submodule to no longer point to the correct place. Currently I have not found an elegant solution to this issue. My current fix was to create symlinks to the submodule directory within the modules, but Terragrunt does not copy the content of the symlink. So I've hacked in to my CI scripts to delete the symlinks and replace it with the files themselves prior to invoking Terragrunt. This is obviously not ideal. I'd like to find if anybody has come across this issue and a more elegant solution then what I have come up with.

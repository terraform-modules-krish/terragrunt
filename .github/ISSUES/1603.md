# Terragrunt configuration has misaligned inputs

**lmayorga1980** commented *Mar 23, 2021*

**Terraform Version:** `0.14.8`
**Terragrunt Version:** `v0.28.15`

I get an error when trying to validate inputs

`terragrunt validate-inputs`

```
ERRO[0000] Terragrunt configuration has misaligned inputs 
ERRO[0000] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1 
```

**variables.tf**

```
variable "machine_type" {
}

variable "image_family" {
}

variable "image_project" {
}

variable "instance_name" {
}

variable "admin_username" {
}

variable "admin_password" {
}

variable "instance_count" {
  default = 1
}

variable "region" {
  
}
```

**terragrunt.hcl**

```
inputs = {
  instance_count = 2
  image_family   = "windows-2019"
  image_project  = "windows-cloud"
  machine_type   = "e2-standard-2"
  instance_name  = "gcloud-instance"
  admin_username = "myadmin"
  admin_password = "somepassword"
  region         = "us-east1"
}

```

Could you share the full log output? Also, please turn up the [logging level](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli-options/#terragrunt-log-level).

Is interesting that this command fails while the other commands like

`terragrunt validate` and `terragrunt plan` work normally.

This is by design. See the command docs for information on what it is trying to achieve: https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli-options/#validate-inputs

That said, I can see us having a `--terragrunt-strict` mode and default to relaxed, where:

- relaxed: only error if missing required inputs
- strict: error on unused vars as well

I'm reading https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/community/contributing/ and
not finding it, so just want to make sure: It seems like there is no CLA
required for the contribution?

I will ask management for approval of OS contribution, just want to make sure
if I need to ping legal with CLA approval request.

# terragrunt destroy fails when component has dependencies which have already been destroyed

**sjpalf** commented *Jun 22, 2020*

If you run terragrunt destroy on a component whose dependencies have been destroyed, terragrunt errors with the error:
`component_a/terragrunt.hcl is a dependency of component_b/terragrunt.hcl but detected no outputs. Either the target module has not been applied yet, or the module has no outputs. If this is expected, set the skip_outputs flag to true on the dependency block.`

As terraform destroy does not need to know the values of inputs, terragtunt destroy should not error in this way.

While the inputs don't matter for terraform destroy it needs to be set to something as terraform requires all the required inputs to be filled. The ideal solution is to generate random values, but this is tricky as we can't just set everything to `null` if there is any non-null compatible processing on the vars (e.g., string interpolation). This means that we would need to parse the terraform code and get the variable types, which I am not sure we want to do that. If we can figure out a nice way to handle this, I think that can be a good feature to add.

As a workaround, you can use `mock_outputs` on the dependency block to skip pulling the dependency on destroy.

thanks @yorinasub17 , using `mock_outputs` seems like a good workaround and also solves the problem of running `terragrunt plan` before the dependencies have been built. As you say it would be nice to have a way of auto-mocking but I appreciate that comes with a lot of complexity

i have the same problem when use edstroy-all in CI pipeline  to delete modules and one module stop destroying with errors.

I have the same issue.

Any clues as in how to mark these as destroyed manually?

Same here as well. In my case, destroy failed intermediately leaving my Terragrunt state in a bad situation. I wasn't able to either apply / destroy. So, I have deleted the whole infrastructure and state files manually to save time. Any automated solution would be better for these kinda situations.

I just have too many resources for that to be disable, this is very much ðŸš©, 7k starts with this issue, I'm amazed.
[UPDATE] I mangled `.tf` file to ignore my error, and it ended up destroying just 3 outputs, all this hardship just to "destroy outputs"

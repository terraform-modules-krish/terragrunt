# using before_hooks to prepare .tfvars files before terraform commands

**ebarault** commented *Mar 28, 2018*

The doc states:
> Before Hooks is a feature of terragrunt that make it possible to define custom actions that will be called before execution of the terraform command.

Right so i tried using them to turn a `.tpl.tfvars` file into a `.tfvars` file by injecting vars in it before running the terraform command.

**First try**: i have the hook preparing the `.tfars` file right into my terragrunt source dir, the file is created, then the `terraform plan` command is executed and prompts me for vars that are defined inside the fresh `.tfvars` file. OK so for some reason the vars are read by terraform from somewhere else.

**Second try**: i have the hook preparing the `.tfars` file into terragrunt's tmp dir, the file is created then the `terraform plan` command is executed and again prompts me for vars that are defined inside the fresh `.tfvars` file. ??? So again the vars from the fresh `.tfvars` file are not used by the `terraform plan` command

**Third try**: my hook prepares the `.tfvars` file inside terragrunt' source dir, i run a first time, interrupt after the file is created, run again, et voil√†!!! it works... vars are parsed from the `.tfvars` file. Pretty obvious since it's pretty much as if i was running without the hook.

How should I use terragrunt's hook so that my `.tfvars` file is created AND used by terraform in the same command?

Try having your hook name the file `<splat>.auto.tfvars` and write it into the tmp directory? .auto indicates to terraform to load the file automatically, without needing to specify it with -var-file... Or setup your terragrunt "extra_arguments" option to pass `-var-file <splat>.tfvars` to the terraform command...?

right on spot! i was specifically investigating the fact that the issue comes from 
```
[terragrunt] 2018/03/28 19:53:13 Skipping var-file /path/to/component.tfvars as it does not exist
```

testing this just now

confirmed, it works, thank-you @lorengordon üëç i was not aware of the `.auto.tfvars` feature

1. although it's a terraform feature, i think it would be a great addition to terragrunt doc, in the section on optional/required vars
2. i would expect before hooks to occur before the files are copied to the tmp dir, i find it counter intuitive the way it is right now

The .auto thing [is documented](https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/variables.html#from-a-file) as a regular Terraform feature, but it is definitely underused and easy to overlook:

> For all files which match terraform.tfvars or *.auto.tfvars present in the current directory, Terraform automatically loads them to populate variables.

Hey @ebarault, I'll keep working regarding point 2 from your [comment](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/453#issuecomment-376981696)

Hi @eak12913, that's great. You can **cc** me in the PR if you want a review.

This *.auto.tfvars does a magic, thx for that. 
But what about if your hook command needs arguments, can I use existing tfvars file? 
I would like escape hardcoding arguments : "dev","eu-west-1", "euw1?

``` 
 terraform {
   source = "github.com:myorg/modules/foo.git"
    extra_arguments "custom_vars" {
      commands = [
        "apply",    "apply-all",
        "plan",      "plan-all",
        "import",      "destroy", "destroy-all", "validate-all"
      ]
      arguments = [
        "-var-file=${get_tfvars_dir()}/../../../../../account-common.tfvars",
        # This file holds values: region = "eu-west1"  env="dev" tag="euw1": 
        "-var-file=${get_tfvars_dir()}/../../../../region-common.tfvars", 
        "-var-file=terraform.tfvars"
      ]
    }

before_hook "my_hook" {
 commands = ["apply", "plan"]
  execute = [
 "${get_tfvars_dir()}/../..//bin/assume-env", "dev", 
"${get_tfvars_dir()}/local_cmd.sh" , "dev",  "eu-west-1", "euw1" 
 ]
  run_on_error = false
 }
...
}
```

@atrakic a hook works for that also... copy the file to the working/tmp dir after the init command...

```
    after_hook "tfvars" {
      commands = ["init"]
      execute  = ["cp", "${get_tfvars_dir()}/foo.auto.tfvars", "."]
    }
```

@lorengordon Thx, but would it interpolate? Should I use get_env()? It looks it is not allowed: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt#interpolation-syntax, or what to use here to escape from harcoding "dev" "eu-west-1" "euw-1"?

# Extend Retryable errors to terragrunt stack retrieval stage

**xynova** commented *Sep 8, 2022*

We get a lot of network transient errors in CI when running pipelines over many stacks at the same time. 502.503 and sometimes 500 errors. 

We were hoping to get around some of those issues with the retryable_errors attribute but it seems that logic only comes into play for errors that occur during the terraform binary execution and not the initial terragrunt code retrieval 

In other words, we dont get retries to happen when we misconfigure the following source

terraform {
  source = "/workdir/tf-stacks/parent_stack/"
}

But we do when misconfiguring the source for nested modules within that parent_stack

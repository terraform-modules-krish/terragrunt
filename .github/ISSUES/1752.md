# Option to apply --refresh-only?

**AnthonyWC** commented *Jul 18, 2021*

Terraform CLI v0.15.4 added option for an `apply --refresh-only` that update backend state to match.  Would be great if terragrunt can also add this refresh-only option.

Terragrunt already supports this as it forwards any args that doesn't have the `--terragrunt` prefix. Either of the following should work:

```
terragrunt apply -refresh-only
terragrunt run-all apply -refresh-only
```

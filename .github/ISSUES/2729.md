# Expected way to tflint modules without a delivery repo? 

**rtizzy** commented *Sep 22, 2023*

Not sure if I'm holding this the wrong way. 

It's clear how one would be able to utilize `tflint` from the module repos via `terragrunt` for example, using `after_hooks` for `validate`.

What isn't clear is this: 

If I'm making module level changes, how can these be linted and validated before merging them in? 

I've been unable to find any reasonable way to accomplish this if I'm also defining provider versions in `delivery`. 

Should I simply start managing provider versions at the module level instead?

Hi,
tflint integration is now available only through hooks,
was considered to use hooks on `validate` command which is executed in pre-commit hooks?
or run `validate` in CICD as a required step before merging the branch?

If terragrunt is not used at all in the repo... then explicit tflint calls can be used

@denis256 The modules themselves are intended to be used with terragrunt. 

The idea I had was to utilize a single TF validate and tflint using `terragrunt` from modules. 

Is there anyway to do that?

Precommit hooks can be skipped hence the desire to run in CI. The CI won't "lie" about the outcome of the tests.

# Publish new versions to WinGet

**JohnLBevan** commented *Feb 14, 2023*

WinGet is a package manager that allows Windows users to install apps via the command line; e.g. `winget install --id Gruntwork.Terragrunt`.

I've submitted a [manifest for v0.43.2](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/pull/96702).

However, it would be great if each new version published automatically became available.  

- The `winget-create` app can be added to your pipeline, per the [guidance here](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-create#using-windows-package-manager-manifest-creator-in-a-cicd-pipeline), to manage the manifest files.
- You'd then need the pipeline to submit this as a PR to the [winget-pkgs repo](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs)

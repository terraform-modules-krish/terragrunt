# S3 backend update/merge policy issue: (The remote state S3 bucket {BUCKET_NAME} needs to be updated)

**apamildner** commented *Sep 21, 2022*

 **tl;dr**: Terragrunt does not marshall exisiting policies properly
 
## Explanation
When terragrunt finds that the s3 bucket you use as a backend is missing TLS+Root Access in its policy,
it asks if you want terragrunt to update it, ie:
```bash
WARN[0002] The remote state S3 bucket BUCKETNAME needs to be updated: 
WARN[0002]   - Bucket Root Access                       
WARN[0002]   - Bucket Enforced TLS                      
Remote state S3 bucket BUCKETNAME is out of date. Would you like Terragrunt to update it? (y/n) y

```

 This is all good, but when we say `y` to this, terragrunt crashes.


 After trying to understand why, I found this [line](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/3a23346e08ee574a4a3a23112350ea625d577a02/aws_helper/policy.go#L15) in the source code. It turns out that a part of our policy is not properly marshalled when terragrunt tries to read it. This is because we have used `NotPrincipal`, i.e like so:
 ```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
        "Effect": "Deny",
        "NotPrincipal": {"AWS": [
            "arn:aws:iam::444455556666:user/Bob",
            "arn:aws:iam::444455556666:root"
        ]},
        "Action": "s3:*",
        "Resource": [
            "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKETNAME",
            "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKETNAME/*"
        ]
    }]
}
 ```
 This is not part of what terragrunt expects when marshalling the policy.

+1 happening on  terragrunt version v0.40.0

As our bucket policy contains "NotAction" and its missing in the struct in policy.go

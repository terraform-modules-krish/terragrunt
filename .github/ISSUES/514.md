# terragrunt state pull throws an "unexpected end of JSON input" error

**cswingler** commented *Jul 6, 2018*

I'm not sure what's going on here, but if you run:

```
% terragrunt init
<snip>
Successfully configured the backend "s3"! Terraform will automatically
use this backend unless the backend configuration changes.
<snip>
Initializing provider plugins...

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

Terragrunt pukes on something not being valid JSON. I don't know _what_ it's puking on, though.  `terraform state pull` works fine.

Can you set the `TERRAGRUNT_DEBUG` env var to true to see if that gives more useful output?
***

**cswingler** commented *Jul 6, 2018*

Updated post with debug output, thanks for the tip!
***

**brikis98** commented *Jul 6, 2018*

Thanks. Based on the stacktrace, I think this is the code that's failing: 

https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/remote/terraform_state_file.go#L78-L80

I think that implies your `.tfstate` file is not valid JSON... Could you take a look at it?

**cswingler** commented *Jul 6, 2018*

This is just after an init and our remote state is stored in s3. It's executing much too quickly to seem like it's actually pulling it down:

```
➜  infra_terraform [default] git:(terragrunt_k8s) ✗  time terragrunt pull > terraform.tfstate

```

If I download it with `terraform state pull` it is indeed valid json.

For what it's worth, our state is a little large (4.6 MB).

**brikis98** commented *Jul 6, 2018*

Do you by chance have a `.tfstate` file sitting around in the current directory? E.g., if you run this all from a clean folder and with the `--terragrunt-source-update` flag, does it work?
***

**chrisportela** commented *Jul 12, 2018*

I had this issue today and wanted to chime in that yes having `*.tfstate` files in the directory will cause problems. I ran in to it when I pulled remote state to `terraform.tfstate` and it started messing with everything.

I recommend using `*.out` or similar instead.

**thirstydeveloper** commented *Jan 1, 2019*

I also ran into this issue, following what seemed to me to be a fairly standard use case.

1. I started with a simple manifest and local state storage
1. I then migrated to using terragrunt to handle configuring remote state in S3
1. `terragrunt init` properly migrated the state to S3
1. `terragrunt plan` broke with the invalid JSON error
1. Removing the `*.tfstate` files from my local file system fixed the error

It would be helpful if `terragrunt` would either:

1. Offer to backup the local state file in a manner that allows terragrunt to run after migrating to remote state
1. Print a warning about local state files if remote state has been configured

@brikis98 - could this issue be reopened?
***

**brikis98** commented *Jan 2, 2019*

@thirstydeveloper Reopened! Could you by any chance create a simple repro? 
***

**thirstydeveloper** commented *Jan 7, 2019*

@brikis98 - Here you go.

https://github.com/thirstydeveloper/terragrunt-s3-state-migration

Also of note, after changing `terraform.tfvars` to use s3 remote state, the first `terragrunt apply` seems to work (at least with this example), but all subsequent `terragrunt apply` produce the invalid JSON error.
***

**brikis98** commented *Jan 8, 2019*

Thanks! We'll take a look.

**koka424** commented *Oct 12, 2019*

I ran into this as well. Removing the terraform.tfstate file fixed the issue.
***

**jeffdyke** commented *Dec 31, 2019*

I'm running into this currently and the only terraform.tfstate i have is 0 bytes b/c it is remotely managed in s3, if i remove it it wants to create and destroy everything.  @thirstydeveloper or @koka424 - did the tfstate file have anything inside?

Edit: yes, removing the 0 byte file worked....it just didn't seem like it because i had other errors that this was masking.  Which may speak to better messaging, like adding the filename.  Clearly my mistake, and thanks for the great project.

**kalebwalton** commented *Apr 8, 2020*

Ran into this today as well after initializing an artifactory state file as empty (following the prompts rather than copying my bad local state in).

UPDATE: It turned out to be a local issue... I removed my .terragrunt-cache and re-ran init, all is well. Not sure what happened...
***

**k3a** commented *Apr 25, 2020*

Happened to me too (Terragrunt v0.23.10) after setting up S3 remote store backend.

The initialization asked for migration like this 
```
Initializing the backend...
Do you want to copy existing state to the new backend?
  Pre-existing state was found while migrating the previous "local" backend to the
  newly configured "s3" backend. No existing state was found in the newly
  configured "s3" backend. Do you want to copy this state to the new "s3"
  backend? Enter "yes" to copy and "no" to start with an empty state.

  Enter a value: yes
```

and succeeded. The following attempt to do `terragrunt plan` resulted in 
```
[terragrunt] 2020/04/25 00:32:37 unexpected end of JSON input
```
which was caused by an empty terraform.tfstate file in the cache. Removing the file fixed it.

@brikis98 
Could you please add this as a warning to the stderr, I guess it will safe a lot of time for all of us. 
***

**zwass** commented *Nov 30, 2020*

I just ran into this. Seems like either deleting the empty file or issuing a warning would be a good fix.

**atsu85** commented *Mar 27, 2021*

is really quite useless. I had a hunch that it could be about state, but unfortunatelly i just checked remote state json from s3 bucket and it was ok - didn't notice local "terraform.tfstate" and ".terraform.tfstate.lock.info" files, as they were in `.gitignore` - what a waste of time it was! 

Would be really useful to get more informative error messages (in this case mentioning `terraform.tfstate` and perhaps even suggesting deleting it, as 0 bytes state file doesn't make sense)

Good idea. Would you be up for a PR to add this?

I am getting this error today. Is this confirmed as fixed?

- tf: v1.0.2
- tg: v0.31.0

cmd: `terragrunt state pull > terraform.tfstate`
error: ```ERRO[0027] unexpected end of JSON input
ERRO[0027] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1```

Also tried clean checkouts, removing `.terragunt-cache` & ensuring `rm -f terraform.tfstate` before cmd

Also tested using v0.31.1, v0.31.2, v0.31.3 - same outcome.

UPDATE: simply running `terragrunt state pull |jq` works fine. which is a bit bizarre?

For those still running into the problem when using `terraform state pull > terraform.tfstate` , the suggestion way up there at the top

fixes it for me. The redirect creates the empty file then the command trips on it. Using `terraform state pull > state.out` works fine (as long as there isn't a terraform.tfstate file in the folder).

Hi,
I was wondering if running terragrunt with `--terragrunt-log-level debug` will show any more details on which command it is failing
***

**abstractalchemist** commented *Aug 29, 2023*

Ran into this today as well.  Even with all debug outputs, it's nearly impossible to tell what the error is.
***

**Sicness** commented *Sep 28, 2023*

Indeed, it's 2023 year and it's a simple issue, but it's still persists. The only way to understand the error is to google this topic. That's a shame.
I'm really trying to start to use terragrunt but it has too many unclear and unreasonable errors from the beginning... :(

Fixed state handling in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.51.7

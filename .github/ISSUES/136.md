# Allow templates to be shared

**dhoer** commented *Feb 18, 2017*

When switching from terraform to terragrunt, I can't share a template file across modules.  Is there a way to do this?

It seems there needs to be a way to include the template(s) along with the module.  

One proposal to do this is to allow multiple sources of directories or files, e.g.
```hcl
  terraform {
    source = ["../../../../templates", "../../../../modules/mymodule"]
  }
```
or

```hcl
  terraform {
    source = ["../../../../templates/user_data.sh", "../../../../modules/mymodule"]
  }
```

Another possible solution could be to add a templates param that would allow for one or more template sources to be declared, e.g.
```hcl
terraform {
    templates = "../../../../templates", 
    source = "../../../../modules/mymodule"
}
```
It would copy template sources to the same temp folder that the module copied so `${path.module}` could be used to reference the templates.

I'm not sure what you mean by this? Could you give an example?

We have multiple modules that include the same template to keep it DRY. 
```
/modules
  /moduleA
  /moduleB
/templates
  /user_data.sh
```
We use relative paths to include templates in the modules:
```hcl
resource "template_file" "instance_user_data" {
  template = "${file("../../templates/user_data.sh")}"

  vars {
    ...
  }
}
```
This worked fine in terraform, but when switching to terragrunt, the modules are copied and ran from a temp directory breaking the relative path relationship. 

I don't know how to share the template in terragrunt.  I have copied the user_data.sh file to each module for now.  If there was a mechanism to copy templates to the same temp directory as the modules, then templates could be shared across multiple modules.

Ah, just use a double-slash.

```hcl
terragrunt = {
  terraform {
    source = "../../../..//modules/mymodule"
  }
}
```

Terragrunt will copy the entire folder before the double slash, so the `templates` folder will be in the same relative path.

Nice!  Thanks for the tip!

Hi, This works great when you have plain text file. I need to generate user_data with variables per module, while some modules use the same user_data rendering, with different variables. I couldn't make it work

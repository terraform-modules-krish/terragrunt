# Inconsistency of relative path functions between base commands and *-all commands

**fitzoh** commented *Jun 27, 2020*

### Versions
Terragrunt v0.23.29
Terraform v0.12.28

### Short Description
The `path_relative_*_include` functions appear to behave differently when used in a base terraform command in a child directory (`terragrunt plan`) than when used in a `*-all` command in the parent directory (`terragrunt plan-all`). 

### Reproducing
I have included a minimal example here: https://github.com/fitzoh/terragrunt-relative-paths

### Use case

I'm creating multiple instances of the same module and am planning on storing the version of the module to use in a yaml file in the directory for each instance.

The parent terragrunt file will then set the source modules based on a tag stored in the yaml file.

This currently works fine if I run it directly from the repo, but blows up when I try to run it using the `*-all` functions as it can't find the config files.

Thanks for providing the repro! 

The bug here is that `xxx-all` is trying to parse the `terragrunt.hcl` you have at the root folder in isolation when it is building up the stack (see [Configuration parsing order](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/getting-started/configuration/#configuration-parsing-order) for more details), and it can't do that because `file` fails. Note that `skip = true` has no effect because the error is during the parsing step: it can't even skip the file because it hasn't parsed `skip`!

I think the fix for this is to update the parsing logic to do 2 passes: the first pass is just partially parsing the `skip` attribute to ignore the root `terragrunt.hcl`, and then exclude those with `skip=true` before going through the second pass to parse the configs.

With that said, here are two workarounds:

- You can rename the root `terragrunt.hcl` (e.g., `root.hcl`) and update the child config to use `path = find_in_parent_folder("root.hcl")` for the `include` block. This ensures that `xxx-all` calls at the root won't attempt to parse the root terragrunt.hcl.

- You can wrap the `yamldecode` call in a [try](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/functions/try.html). This ensures that terragrunt can parse the config while building up the stack, and then skip it when it sees `skip = true`.

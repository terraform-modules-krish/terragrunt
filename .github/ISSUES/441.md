# Is GCS supported as remote state ?

**ArchiFleKs** commented *Mar 20, 2018*

Hi, I'm trying to use GCS as a backend for remote state, I adapted the configuration from S3 but it keep asking me for bucket name when I run `terragrunt init` and state is store in root bucket folder despite using the same syntax as documentation

What is the contents of your `.tfvars` file? What about your `.tf` file?

I found the answer here : https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/169

The main doc is unclear or maybe it is my english but it says 
> To fill in the settings via Terragrunt, create a terraform.tfvars file in the root folder and in each of the Terraform modules

But in fact it is in the root folder of your `live` folder and inside each different environment

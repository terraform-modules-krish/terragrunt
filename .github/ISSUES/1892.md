Hello, from the description is not clear which version of Terragrunt is used, I prepared small example for includes in 
https://github.com/denis256/terragrunt-tests/tree/master/issue-1892

```
.
├── app
│   ├── main.tf
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
├── app2
│   ├── main.tf
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
├── overwrite.hcl
└── terragrunt.hcl
```

without errors works approach from "app" directory with `include "root" / include "overwrite" `

```
$ terragrunt --version
terragrunt version v0.35.4
$ cd app
$ terragrunt apply
app             <--------------- evaluation of HCL in app directory
overwrite       <--------------- evaluation of HCL in overwrite.hcl
root            <--------------- evaluation of HCL in terragrunt.hcl
local_file.foo: Refreshing state...
....
Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

$ cd app2
$ terragrunt apply
ERRO[0000] Multiple bare include blocks (include blocks without label) is not supported. 
ERRO[0000] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1
```

As @denis256 mentioned, this is a versioning issue. Support for multiple includes was introduced in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.32.0 Please update your `terragrunt` install to that version or newer to take advantage of this feature!

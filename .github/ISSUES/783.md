# GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS no more since Terragrunt 0.19.6

**fhusson** commented *Jul 11, 2019*

Hi,

We use the GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS to store the content of the credentials (not the file path)
It worked with previous version of terragrunt, but since the Terragrunt 0.19.6 it doesn't work anymore.

if we use a GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS var with the file path it works, but we don't want to store the information on the CI/CD runner.

We use a simple remote state with GCS

```
remote_state {
  backend = "gcs"
  config = {
    bucket         = "mybucket"
    prefix         = "myprefix/with/folders"
  }
}
```

@robmorgan @autero1 Could you help out with this one?

This is because the new GCS Remote State feature [creates](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/5e05e0c1f2aaa79c3cde1e50889bf63cef03dadc/remote/remote_state_gcs.go#L384) a GCP Client only using the default [ADC behaviour](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production#providing_credentials_to_your_application) whereas the Google Terraform Provider has additional [behaviour](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/provider_reference.html#credentials-1) for obtaining credentials before falling back to ADC. 

`GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` is one of the additional environment variables that the Google Terraform Provider supports, but is not part of ADC.

I also encountered this issue on my CI/CD pipeline.

Also, as a side effect of this new GCS Remote storage feature, the GCP credentials for provided to Terragrunt/Terraform now requires additional `storage.buckets.get` permission on the GCS bucket. I understand that this "auto-create" feature can be disabled by setting `disable_init` to `false`, but this also prevents the backend from being init. Is there way to only disable the check for the GCS bucket existence while still allowing the backend to be init?

Hi, thanks for the response, can we have a backward compatible version with GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS ?

Any update on this issue?

hi @fhusson, @eyalzek it would be great if you could help test my PR: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/907. Just checkout the branch and build a custom version of terragrunt: `go build -o terragrunt . && ./terragrunt`. Then try setting the `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.

@robmorgan I'm seeing the same error: `Missing required GCS remote state configuration project`.

**robmorgan** commented *Oct 14, 2019*

hi @eyalzek, can you share your `remote_state` definition? I'm assuming you built the version in my branch `mirror-terraform-gcp-auth`?

We have used a workarround with gitlab ci/cd we have set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS as a file variable, that way the file is only temporary on the runner.
I can try to check the patch in 2 weeks.

@fhusson roger.

Going to reopen until we have confirmation that the latest patch (released as https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.20.5) is working.

**robmorgan** commented *Oct 21, 2019*

Okay

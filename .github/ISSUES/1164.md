# Failed to instantiate provider "aws" to obtain schema: timeout while waiting for plugin to start

Error: ```Failed to instantiate provider "aws" to obtain schema: timeout while waiting for plugin to start```

When I run, ```terragrunt validate-all``` I am seeing the following error above. It seems to work for 90% of the regions, but will error out at the very end. Any ideas on what might be going on? 

terragrunt 0.23.13
terraform 0.12.24

My guess is that this is related to https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/879. How many components are in your terragrunt stack that you are running `validate-all` on, and how many of those are parallel?

@yorinasub17 About 30 components and all are running in parallel. I am going to try to split it up to see if it helps.

@yorinasub17 Yeah, that did the trick. I will close this issue, but it is definitely related #879

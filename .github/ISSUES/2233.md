# Could not parse output from terragrunt config when AWS_CSM_ENABLED=true

**LiamDeaconAntarcticaAM** commented *Aug 11, 2022*

Hi, I've encountered an error when trying to run `terragrunt apply` with `AWS_CSM_ENABLED` environment variable set to `true`. I receive an error message:

```bash
> cd /the/path/to/terragrunt-projects/project-that-depends-on-cicd-setup
> terragrunt apply
ERRO[0002] Could not parse output from terragrunt config /the/path/to/terragrunt-projects/cicd-setup/terragrunt.hcl. Underlying error: invalid character '/' after top-level value 
ERRO[0002] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1
```  

However I don't encounter the error when I set:

```bash
# /bin/bash
> export AWS_CSM_ENABLED=false
> terragrunt apply  # provides plan with prompt to apply changes as expected
```

>NOTE: I ran `terragrunt apply --terragrunt-log-level debug --terragrunt-debug`, which provided some additional insight, which gave me the idea to try disabling AWS client side monitoring:

```bash
> terragrunt apply --terragrunt-log-level debug --terragrunt-debug

I was wondering whether anyone had encountered this issue before and what can be done about it - Fundamentally it seems like a bug in terragrunt,  but you can never be sure with all the moving parts these days ðŸ˜‰ 

As a user it would be helpful to have a more specific error for this case (or some additional text stating have I tried disabling AWS CSM) otherwise it is hard to understand the underlying root cause of the error.

For additional context, my `terragrunt.hcl` (within `/the/path/to/terragrunt-projects/project-that-depends-on-cicd-setup`) looks like the following:

```terraform
include "root" {
    path = "${get_repo_root()}/src/terraform/terragrunt.hcl"
}

dependencies {
  paths = ["../cicd-setup"]
}

dependency "cicd" {
  config_path = "../cicd-setup"
}

terraform {
  # NOTE: Try disabling AWS client side monitoring, e.g. `export AWS_CSM_ENABLED=false` if you encounter the following error when running `terragrunt (plan|apply)`:
  #       Could not parse output from terragrunt config python-mono/src/terraform/bootstrap/cicd-setup/terragrunt.hcl. Underlying error: invalid character '/' after top-level value

  before_hook "check_github_token_set" {
    commands     = ["apply", "plan", "destroy"]
    execute      = ["bash", "-c", "if [[ -z $GITHUB_TOKEN ]]; then echo -e '*** \\033[1;33m$GITHUB_TOKEN\\033[0m must be set ***' && exit 126; fi "]
    run_on_error = false
  }
}

inputs = {
  github_actions_codebuild_build_stage_project_name = dependency.cicd.outputs.codebuild_projects["pr-build"].project_name
  github_actions_codebuild_deploy_stage_project_name = dependency.cicd.outputs.codebuild_projects["pr-deploy"].project_name
  github_actions_codebuild_region = dependency.cicd.outputs.codebuild_region
}

```

I'm seeing this too, I tried upgrading to the latest Terragrunt, Terraform and AWS provider versions (details below) but the problem persists whenever I have CSM mode enabled.

In my case the error only seems to manifest when I run Terragrunt in a folder whose `terragrunt.hcl` file declares a dependency block (much like the `cicd` example given by @LiamDeaconAntarcticaAM above, if I've understood it correctly).

Terragrunt: v0.39.1
Terraform: v1.3.2
AWS Provider: v4.35.0

I am seeing this too and was very obscure to track down. 

Error also only manifests when there is a dependency block. 

Terragrunt v0.43.2
Terraform v1.3.9
AWS Provider: 4.49.0

The root of this issue stems from [aws-sdk-go](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/blob/81d1cbbc6a2028023aff7bcab0fe1be320cd39f7/aws/session/session.go#L444) code, where a plaintext CSM log is displayed to stdout even if the `output -json` flag is specified. 

A similar issue is also mentioned in **terraform-provider-aws** [issue #23620](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/23620).

The only way is to filter that CSM log from the output. Fixed in #2554

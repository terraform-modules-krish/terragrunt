# S3 state bucket default encryption using SSE-KMS, but objects still encrypted with SSE-S3?

**jpalomaki** commented *Sep 29, 2022*

Hello,

I tested terragrunt `0.38.12` (on terraform `0.12.31`) in one of our AWS environments, applied the new state bucket settings as terragrunt prompted me to do so (`WARN[0003]   - Bucket Server-Side Encryption`, per the new feature to enforce those bucket settings, that appeared in `v0.37.0`), so that the bucket was in fact updated to use default encryption of `SSE-KMS` with the default `aws/s3` key.

Now when I apply a new config (`terragrunt apply`), the state file is encrypted with `SSE-S3`, instead of `SSE-KMS`. Is this expected? I presume this would happen if the state saving S3 PUT request specifies `SSE-S3` instead (overriding the bucket default of `SSE-KMS`).

I am currently not specifying a KMS key id in the remote state settings, so looking at https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#remote_state, I expected that to default to `SSE-KMS` (with key `aws/s3`), but it looks like we are getting `SSE-S3` instead.

Any pointers are greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Jukka

Furthermore, if we specify:

```hcl
remote_state {
  backend = "s3"

  config = {
    encrypt              = true
    ...
    bucket_sse_algorithm = "AES256"
  }
}
```
and we apply with that config (to change the SSE algorithm to SSE-S3), we still get the `WARN` to update the bucket SSE settings on subsequent plans.

Looking at https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/3a23346e08ee574a4a3a23112350ea625d577a02/remote/remote_state_s3.go#L1080 terragrunt seems to only accept `aws:kms` for the algorithm, to detect SSE being enabled?

Is the use of `SSE-S3` discouraged here?

I myself find the terragrunt default bucket SSE settings vs what is actually being used by terraform somewhat confusing.

Hi,
state file, in the end, is managed by `terraform` which encrypts objects with different encryption

All right, that explains the behavior.

@denis256 I believe this is a bug. I am using the latest versions of terragrunt, terraform, AWS provider.

I create a terraform state bucket outside of terragrunt with SSE-S3 encryption enabled, I store the state for this bucket in itself, I then plan in terragrunt and terragrunt tells me I still need to apply encryption configuration, and if I say `y` then it will apply KMS encryption configuration instead of SSE-S3/AES256. Am I using `bucket_sse_algorithm` incorrectly? Or is it not being respected in terragrunt for some reason?

`root.hcl`

```
remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  generate = {
    path      = "remote_state.tf"
    if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  }
  config = {
    region               = "us-west-2"
    bucket               = "terraform-new"
    key                  = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
    encrypt              = true
    bucket_sse_algorithm = "AES256"
  }
}
```

`terragrunt.hcl`
```

# defaults for this cloudposse module are very good already, including server side encryption of the bucket
inputs = {
  allow_encrypted_uploads_only = true
  allow_ssl_requests_only      = true

  bucket_name        = "terraform-new"
}

terraform {
  source = "git@github.com:cloudposse/terraform-aws-s3-bucket.git?ref=3.0.0"
}

include "root" {
  path           = find_in_parent_folders("root.hcl")
  expose         = true
  merge_strategy = "deep"
}
```

Hi,
I will take a look on implementation and some more tests

**kevcube** commented *Oct 26, 2022*

@denis see #2337 please

I was wrong, the bucket doesn't actually change the encryption from `AES256` to `aws:kms` after we've set the `bucket_sse_algorithm`, however it does still prompt us to update it on every run.

It just updates it to the same thing that it is already set to.

Seems like the check needs to be made smarter, but the enablement code is correct.

```golang
			if rule.ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault.SSEAlgorithm != nil {
				if *rule.ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault.SSEAlgorithm == s3.ServerSideEncryptionAwsKms {
					return true, nil
				}

				return false, nil
```

In `func checkIfSSEForS3Enabled`, you will get `false` if you don't use KMS (if you use AES256).

**kevcube** commented *Nov 9, 2022*

@bradonkanyid yeah that's what I have addressed in #2337, hoping for a review soon. Otherwise you can just say "yes" to bucket changes and nothing will happen, but this is confusing my team.

Fix has been merged in version 0.43.2. It solved the issue. Thanks @kevcube

Hi all!
I've tried terragrunt version v0.44.5 with enabled properties `bucket_sse_algorithm = "aws:kms"` and `bucket_sse_kms_key_id = my_kms_key` and encryption on state file present as SSE-S3, not SSE-KMS.
Default encryption for the bucket is SSE-KMS and my_kms_key.
Even if I manually change the encryption of tf-state file to KMS and the proper key, after applying tf-state encryption is rollback to SSE-S3.
I'm trying to change encryption for tf-state files from SSE-S3 to SSE-KMS and customer-managed key.
Is the above relevant for this tread?

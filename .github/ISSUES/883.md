# apply-all and destroy-all failing with 

**andrewCluey** commented *Sep 28, 2019*

I seem to be hitting a problem every time I try to run 'apply-all' and 'destroy-all in my root environment directory. 

Here's the file structure for my config files:
```
|── terragrunt.hcl
|── alb
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
|── gateways
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
|── routes
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
|── security_groups
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
|── target_groups
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
|── vpc
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
|── win_app
    └── terragrunt.hcl
```
Back end config, along with some variables, are in the root .hcl file. Dependency blocks are defined in each .hcl file and used to gather outputs such as VPC_ID and Subnet_ids.

```bash
Encountered the following errors:
Cannot process module Module /Users/andy/tf-test/terragrunt-test/examples/win_app (excluded: false, dependencies: [/Users/andy/tf-test/terragrunt-test/examples/vpc, /Users/andy/tf-test/terragrunt-test/examples/security_groups, /Users/andy/tf-test/terragrunt-test/examples/gateways, /Users/andy/tf-test/terragrunt-test/examples/routes, /Users/andy/tf-test/terragrunt-test/examples/alb, /Users/andy/tf-test/terragrunt-test/examples/target_groups]) because one of its dependencies, Module /Users/andy/tf-test/terragrunt-test/examples/gateways (excluded: false, dependencies: [/Users/andy/tf-test/terragrunt-test/examples/vpc]), finished with an error: open /Users/andy/tf-test/terragrunt-test/examples/vpc/.terragrunt-cache/Ba~bRpuI/lBOnpN~OWQ/vpc/main.tf: no such file or directory
```
And upon destroy-all
```bash

```

I've tried this with Terragrunt version 19.27 & 19.26 (errors above from 19.27). terraform version is 12.9..

When I run terragrunt apply (or destroy) in each directory individually, all is fine.

Just been doing some more tests, and when I change to version 19.21 of Terragrunt, all is fine.

Ran through 5 or 6 deployments/tear-downs using apply-all/destroy-all and each time is perfect.

Hi can you share:

- `terragrunt.hcl` config for `vpc`
- `terragrunt.hcl` config for `security_groups`
- The entire output of the logs, not just the snippets?

That will make it easier to debug the issue. Thanks!

Hard to tell without more info. What's in `win_app/terragrunt.hcl`?

Oh, whoops, didn't see Yori's response above. The stuff he asked for is very useful too!

Closing as stale. If there is still an issue here, please open a new ticket. Thanks!

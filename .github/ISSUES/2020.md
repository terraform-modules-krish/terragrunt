# Error: Inconsistent dependency lock file

**MFAshby** commented *Feb 22, 2022*

Note I'm doing something rather strange, this is almost certainly not a common use-case.

I have a system testing setup, where several (~10) copies of our system are booted to provide a 'pool' of instances that the test runner can use to run tests on. The system comprises several different applications with dependencies on one another. We have a big bash script that boots the whole lot in docker. I'm trying to replace a lot of bash script and docker with terraform / terragrunt configuration instead to make it more scaleable, maintainable, and flexible.

In order to keep the boot time for this setup reasonable, I need to start the different copies (referred to as 'stacks') in parallel. 

In order to achieve parallel boot, I'm running terragrunt multiple times in parallel, once per 'stack'. The state and data directories are kept separate from one another in order that they don't interfere. I have a terragrunt file that looks like this:
```terraform
# Containers isolated per stack, use separate data and state directories per-stack
locals {
  stack_suffix = get_env("TF_VAR_stack_suffix", "")
}
remote_state {
  backend = "local"
  config = {
    path = local.stack_suffix == "" ? ".state/terraform" : "./.${local.stack_suffix}.state/terraform"
  }
  # https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#dependency
  # You are not relying on before_hook, after_hook, or extra_arguments to the terraform init call. 
  # NOTE: terragrunt will not automatically detect this and you will need to explicitly opt out of the dependency 
  # optimization flag.
  disable_dependency_optimization = true
} 
terraform {
  extra_arguments "stack_workspace" {
    env_vars = {
      TF_DATA_DIR = local.stack_suffix == "" ? ".terraform" : ".${local.stack_suffix}.terraform"
    }
    commands = [
      "init",
      "apply",
      "refresh",
      "import",
      "plan",
      "taint",
      "untaint",
      "output"
    ]
  }
  # Multiple processes will read this lockfile simultaneously
  # so it's not safe to allow updates
  extra_arguments "lockfile_readonly" {
    commands = [
      "init"
    ]
    arguments = [
      "-lockfile=readonly",
    ]
  }
}
```

This _mostly_ works, however I'm occasionally hitting an error where the terraform dependency lock file appears to be inconsistent
```
16:14:38 Error: Inconsistent dependency lock file
```

Terraform already accepts a command to prevent it from updating the terraform lock file, and I'm specifying this in my configuration above. _However_, terragrunt itself is also modifying the lock file: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/4fb4c70b9160630f0ca9074635c5c9885edef066/cli/cli_app.go#L734 

In my case, it's actually just copying the same file over itself (since terraform is not trying to change it) but it's enough that occasionally a terraform process sees an invalid lock file.

I can most likely work around this by separately running `terragrunt run-all init` sequentially for each stack, before running `terragrunt run-all apply` in parallel for each stack.

Alternatively, this copy command can be a little smarter and skip the copy if the file contents are actually the same file. I'll see if I can raise a PR.

As a workaround, I can run `init` serially, and separate from `apply`, so that the dependency lock file is never modified by multiple processes.

Hi, 
I was wondering if for each parallel invocation, can be passed different `terragrunt-working-dir` to save separated state files and avoid copy of other state files

Hi @denis256 , thanks for the suggestion. 

Maybe it would work? My understanding is that I would also need to copy all my actual terraform files to that folder as well. My folder structure at the moment looks like: 
```
stack
 L terragrunt.hcl       <-- this is the file shown above
 L app1
   L terragrunt.hcl
   L main.tf
   L .1.state
     L terraform
   L .1.terraform
     L ... files ...
   L .2.state
     L terraform
   L .2.terraform
     L ... files ...
 L app2
   L terrgrunt.hcl
   L main.tf
   L ...
```

and if I took your suggestion I think I could dispense with the special modifications to the .terraform and .state directories, and I would have a structure more like 
```
stack
 L terragrunt.hcl
 L app1
   L terragrunt.hcl
   L main.tf
 L app2
   L terragrunt.hcl
   L main.tf 
stack-1
 L terragrunt.hcl
 L app1
   L terragrunt.hcl
   L main.tf
   L .state
     L terraform
   L .terraform
     L ... files ...
 L app2
   L terragrunt.hcl
   L main.tf
   L .state
     L terraform
   L .terraform
     L ... files ... 
stack-2
 L ... as above ...
```

which is probably... fine! thanks for the idea!

I ran into this issue - and I think its related to this in my case:
The config.key (see-below for context) was set to format("%s/terraform.tfstate", path_relative_to_include()).  Since I have a mirrored tree layout (same-named folders with terragrunt.hcl)  between us-east-1 and us-east-2, I think the system was trying to re-use the same key for the modules within the s3 bucket.

```
.
├── us-east-1
│  ├── _backend.tf
│  ├── aws-infrastructure
│  │  └── aurora
│  │     └── terragrunt.hcl
│  ├── main_providers.tf
│  └── terragrunt.hcl  <-- this file has the remote_state definition for us-east-1
└── us-east-2
   ├── _backend.tf
   ├── aws-infrastructure
   │  └── aurora
   │     └── terragrunt.hcl
   └── terragrunt.hcl <-- this file has the remote_state definition for us-east-2
```
The key in the remote state (below example for us-east-2) needs to be different between the regions
```
remote_state {
  backend      = "s3"
  disable_init = tobool(get_env("TERRAGRUNT_DISABLE_INIT", "false"))

  generate = {
    path      = "_backend.tf"
    if_exists = "overwrite"
  }

  config = {
    encrypt        = true
    region         = "us-east-2". <-- the bucket region has to stay the same 
    key            = format("%s-us-east-2/terraform.tfstate", path_relative_to_include())
    bucket         = format("terraform-states-%s", get_aws_account_id())
    dynamodb_table = format("terraform-states-%s", get_aws_account_id())

    skip_metadata_api_check     = true
    skip_credentials_validation = true
  }
}
```

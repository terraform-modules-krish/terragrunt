# AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE environment variable does not seem to be read

**mechastorm** commented *Jan 3, 2017*

Similar to #85 

Terragrunt Version: v0.7.3
OS: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
Terraform Version: 0.8.2

Repro:
- set up a custom AWS credentials file with multiple account access keys ad secrets
- set the path to file into the global environment AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE 
- run terraform plan
- run terragrunt plan

Result
- Terraform runs as expected
- Terragrunt gives a credential error. Example output
```
terragrunt plan -var-file=/my_path/env.tfvars -out=/my_path/env.tfplan --terragrunt-config /my_path/env.terragrunt
[terragrunt] 2017/01/03 22:43:02 Reading Terragrunt config file at /my_path/env.terragrunt
[terragrunt] 2017/01/03 22:43:02 Initializing remote state for the s3 backend
[terragrunt] 2017/01/03 22:43:07 Error finding AWS credentials (did you set the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables?): NoCredentialProviders: no valid providers in chain. Deprecated. 
	For verbose messaging see aws.Config.CredentialsChainVerboseErrors
```

The official AWS GO support the global AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE  -  https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/blob/b2dc98bb584e48b0f5f39c93110633173c5da43c/aws/credentials/shared_credentials_provider.go#L30

So in theory terragrunt should just be able to read it but I am not sure what could be messing with it. Any ideas?

Ok I found a possible cause of this issue.

It looks like the project is using an older version of the AWS GO SDK

On the [glide.lock on master](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/glide.lock), the version it points to is https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/commit/665c623d7f3e0ee276596b006655ba4dbe0565b0 (May 29)

AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE env support was introduced to the SDK on Aug 11 (https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/commit/33201594b4a9739b28d96517dad34a47bc741910)

As such I think the fix for this is to rebuild terrragrunt with the latest AWS GO SDK - bumping it from 1.4.14 to the latest v1.6.9 (https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

I am still a newbie at Go, so will take awhile for me to try to get this running but if someone can do the version bump and test, please go ahead.

Ah, nice find. To update to the latest version (you'll have to install [glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide)), you should be able to just run: 

```
glide up --all-dependencies
``` 

You can then build a new binary locally by running (you'll have to install [gox](https://github.com/mitchellh/gox)): 

```
gox -os windows -arch amd64 -output my-terragrunt-binary -ldflags "-X main.VERSION=testing-version"
```

If `my-terragrunt-binary` works correctly, submit a PR!

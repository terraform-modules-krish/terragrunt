# Terragrunt doesn't handle gitflow-style branch names with intervening '/' components

**JonRoma** commented *Aug 25, 2017*

When using [git flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), git branches typically use the format `feature/some_name` (note the intervening '/' that forms part of the branch name.

Terragrunt has problems when using arguments like `ref=feature/aws-pip` inside the terraform source block (see code below), and fails with the following errors:

```
[terragrunt] [/Users/roma/Documents/Git/Develop/as-aws-test/us-east-2/s3] 2017/08/25 12:09:52 Running command: terraform init -backend-config=region=us-east-2 -backend-config=encrypt=true -backend-config=lock_table=terragrunt -backend-config=bucket=some-bucket -backend-config=key=terraform/us-east-2/s3/terraform.tfstate -from-module=git::ssh://git@github.com/xxxxx/yyyyy?ref=feature%2Faws-pip /var/folders/s8/wrrcfgxx3xn9324mzlh22y9m0000gn/T/terragrunt/dBW5enHv4n8PiauOhkuKLGZuEts/hXguENDnCYLYi1BpEbTUS_jiXXs

```

The terraform.tfvars file contains
```
terragrunt = {
  include {
    path = "${find_in_parent_folders()}"
  }

  terraform {
  source = "git::git@github.com:xxxxx/yyyyy//default-s3-buckets?ref=feature/aws-pip"
  }
}
```

I'm using Terragrunt v0.13.0 with Terraform v0.10.2 on MacOS El Capitan.

This may or may not be Terragrunt's fault; it *could* be an issue with Terraform itself, in which case, I'll refile this  issue against Terraform.

I had the same thought. Can you try this with Terraform directly and see what happens?

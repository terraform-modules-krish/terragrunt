# git show-toplevel should use caching

**tjstansell** commented *Oct 31, 2022*

I've been debugging slow startup times for terragrunt and one of the things I've noticed is that the various terragrunt functions that resolve paths relative to the git root all run `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`.  Here's a look at the timing coming out of terragrunt (after i built a custom build to enable microsecond timestamps):

```
root@d3069cc15eed:/app/prd/accounts/saws2-dev# /app/terragrunt graph-dependencies --terragrunt-log-level=trace 2>tg.out
digraph {
	"/app/prd/accounts/saws2-dev" ;
	"/app/prd/accounts/saws2-dev" -> "/app/prd/org";
	"us-east-1" ;
	"us-east-1" -> "/app/prd/accounts/saws2-dev";
	"us-east-2" ;
	"us-east-2" -> "/app/prd/accounts/saws2-dev";
	"us-west-1" ;
	"us-west-1" -> "/app/prd/accounts/saws2-dev";
	"us-west-2" ;
	"us-west-2" -> "/app/prd/accounts/saws2-dev";
	"us-west-2/main" ;
	"us-west-2/main" -> "us-west-2";
	"/app/prd/org" ;
}

The git root directory should be static and should only need to be evaluated once, then individual relative directory paths calculated from that.  This particular example output is from one of many accounts.  Looking at a total runtime across our entire repo, this gets called 679 times and adds roughly 8 seconds to terragrunt startup time and could be easily eliminated.

I'd be interested in working on that enhancement

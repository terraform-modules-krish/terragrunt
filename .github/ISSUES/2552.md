# Can't pass sensitive output from a module to another one as a (sensitive) variable

**tailaiw** commented *May 3, 2023*

I have a module `database` which outputs the database password as a sensitive output

```hcl
# terraform/database/outputs.tf
output "password" {
  value     = aws_db_instance.db.password
  sensitive = true
}
```

I have a module `app` that depends on the `database` module and wanted to take the database password as a sensitive variable

```hcl
# terragrunt/_env/app.hcl
dependency "database" {
  config_path = find_in_parent_folders("database")
}

inputs = {
  db_ password = dependency.database.outputs.password
}
```

```hcl
# terraform/app/variables.tf
variable "db_password" {
  type      = string
  sensitive = true
}
```

When I `terragrunt apply` the app module, I got the error complaining `Unsupported attribute; This object does not have an attribute named "password".`. I understand the `sensitive=true` in the database module's output makes the output not included in the output file. Does the app module take the dependent variable from the output file or the dependent module's state file?

Hi,
reading of sensitive data is supported, maybe that `find_in_parent_folders("database")` find a different directory with different files

I have a simplified example in https://github.com/denis256/terragrunt-tests/tree/master/sensitive-output-2552 

```
├── README.md
├── app
│   ├── main.tf
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
└── dependency
    ├── main.tf
    └── terragrunt.hcl
```

```
# dependency/main.tf 
output "password" {
  value = "potato"
  sensitive = true
}

# app/terragrunt.hcl 
dependency "d1" {
  config_path = "../dependency"
}

inputs = {
  content = dependency.d1.outputs.password
}

# app/main.tf 
variable "content" {}
resource "local_file" "file" {
  content     = var.content
  filename = "${path.module}/file.txt"
}

```

```
$ cd app
# since it is first run, I apply on dependency too
$ terragrunt run-all apply
Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
$ cat file.txt
potato
```

@denis256 thank you so much for the example! You're right that reading sensitive output works. I look into this again and realize the problem in my case is that my AWS RDS database was not setup with explicit password but auto-generated with AWS secret manager, so `aws_rds_instance.db.password` is (effectively) null. So to solve my problem, I need to pass the secret manager id and retrieve the password in the app, instead of relying on the sensitive output/input of terraform.

What is still confusing me is that, when I do something like the following, I can see from the state file that terraform does output this variable `password` which has a `null` value.
```hcl 
output "password" {
  value     = null
  sensitive = true
}
```

But when my value is `aws_db_instance.db.password` which is a _sensitive null_ (see below), terraform skips including it in the output. No sure if this is expected behavior of terraform but it is somehow misleading.

```
> aws_db_instance.db.password
(sensitive value)
> nonsensitive(aws_db_instance.db.password)
tostring(null)
```

Hm, can be used `data / aws_secretsmanager_secret_version` to read password?

```
data "aws_secretsmanager_secret_version" "password" {
  secret_id = data.aws_secretsmanager_secret.password
}
```

```
data.aws_secretsmanager_secret_version.password
```

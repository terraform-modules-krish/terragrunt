# Terragrunt 0.19.6 breaks existing GCP config

**mattford63** commented *Jun 28, 2019*

A working config on 0.19.5 now fails on 0.19.6 (likely due to GCP changes)

I have this as a parent

```
remote_state {
  backend = "gcs"
  config = {
    bucket = "project-factory-592341-tfstate"
    prefix = "${path_relative_to_include()}"
  }
}
```

And this as a child

```
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}
```

The error I see is

```
[terragrunt] 2019/06/28 14:11:13 Initializing remote state for the gcs backend
[terragrunt] 2019/06/28 14:11:13 Missing required GCS remote state configuration project
[terragrunt] 2019/06/28 14:11:13 Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1
```

Switching back to using 0.19.5 results in a successful execution?  Did I miss a config change?

Ah, I was a bit hasty in reporting this, I see now that the project config attribute is required.

Actually, is it sensible that project and location must now be specified even for externally created buckets?

No, it's not really fair, to be honest. I'll start preparing a workaround.

My proposal: `project` and `location` will only be mandatory when creating a bucket.

Testing a new release, will likely ship it tomorrow.

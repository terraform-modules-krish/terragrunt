# Terragrunt exposes complete backend config which may contain secrets

**skluck** commented *Sep 18, 2020*

Terragrunt outputs the complete backend config when it detects changes, it seems to do this even when there are no changes. But the main issue I think is that some backend configs may have secrets, and so shouldn't ever be output.

In the last code block below look for the `backend config has changed from map` section.

The example output below is run in a docker container after just installing terraform 0.13.2 and terragrunt 0.23.40. From looking at the latest master code there should be no difference from 0.24.x I believe.

----

My terragrunt config:
```
# terragrunt.hcl
remote_state {
  backend = "http"

  generate = {
    path      = "backend.tf"
    if_exists = "overwrite"
  }

 config = {
    address        = get_env("TF_BACKEND_URL")
    lock_address   = get_env("TF_BACKEND_URL")
    unlock_address = get_env("TF_BACKEND_URL")

    username = get_env("TF_STATE_API_USERNAME")
    password = get_env("TF_STATE_API_PASSWORD")
 }
}
```

No secrets are contained in the file itself, but terragrunt will render the entire config for the backend if it changes.
My example project is the simple self-signed cert module from the vault terraform. Here's output:

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

@brikis98 @yorinasub17 - I see you fixed GCS and AWS S3, but forgot about Azure :)

I just hit this when using Azure Blob Storage as my backend with Terratest, caught it locally otherwise my Github CI pipeline would have exposed my Storage Account connection string publically.

```

Here's the Terratest module that triggers the above: https://github.com/KangarooKube/kube-arc-data-services-installer-job/blob/f3b94b3384ca5f3a50218dfef2b4cc2fef9f8568/ci/test/aks_integration_test.go#L65

I need to use Verbose mode for Go test to trace errors back from CI Pipeline - so it would be great if the Blob Storage Backendconfig could mask out these secrets if possible.

In my case this is happening in Terratest but I'm commenting here as there's an existing convo.

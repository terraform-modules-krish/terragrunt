# --terragrunt-exclude-dir not working?

**jcalvento** commented *Feb 5, 2020*

I have the following structure
```
root
|- commons (should not read this directly)
     | - *.tf
     | - *.hcl
|-dev
     | - parent.hcl
     | - commons
|-test
     | - parent.hcl
     | - commons
```
I'd like to run a plan-all on the root folder but when I try to exclude commons dir it reads it anyway
`terragrunt plan-all --terragrunt-exclude-dir ./commons`
I'm getting 
```
 Error processing module at '.../root/commons/dynamodb/items/configs/terragrunt.hcl'. How this module was found: Terragrunt config file found in a subdirectory of .../root/. Underlying error: .../root/commons/dynamodb/items/configs/terragrunt.hcl:9,10-33: Error in function call; Call to function "find_in_parent_folders" failed: ParentFileNotFound: Could not find a terragrunt.hcl in any of the parent folders of .../root/commons/dynamodb/items/configs/terragrunt.hcl. Cause: Traversed all the way to the root.., and 1 other diagnostic(s)
```

Can you share the full log output up to the interactive prompt asking if you would like to run this on a list of modules?

@yorinasub17 Sorry for the late response but that's all the logs I have. I'm not getting any kind of confirmation to run this

Ah ok so it is failing in the partial parsing of the configuration. Because the include and exclude functionality still processes the dependencies, terragrunt needs to read just enough of the configuration in ALL config that it finds in the current working directory to build the tree, before proceeding to process include and excludes. So you need to have a complete, valid config for those components even for those directories that are excluded.

As far as what components need to be valid, see https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/getting-started/configuration/#configuration-parsing-order, specifically the section about `-all`.

I'm also facing the same issue.

Perhaps there should be a new option to ask Terragrunt to simply ignore some directories when finding modules to run?

I am weary of adding additional config options here. I think real solution here would be to fix the processing so that `terragrunt` processes includes and excludes prior to reading the config. We're a bit buried to implement this, but a PR to fix that implementation would be much appreciated!

Ah FYI, https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1644 would provide a workaround for this.

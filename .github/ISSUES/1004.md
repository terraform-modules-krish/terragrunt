# Not able to create VPC

**sdot257** commented *Jan 15, 2020*

I get a bunch of errors when I try to run `terragrunt plan`. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. Here's a snippet of the errors (there are many).

```
Error: Reference to undeclared resource

  on outputs.tf line 365, in output "vpc_endpoint_dynamodb_id":
 365:   value       = concat(aws_vpc_endpoint.dynamodb.*.id, [""])[0]

A managed resource "aws_vpc_endpoint" "dynamodb" has not been declared in the
root module.

Can you also share the folder structure? Specifically, I am most interested in seeing if you have other TF files in `tf-live/sandbox/us-east-1/vpc`.

@yorinasub17 Most likely, you have nailed the issue.
I was hit by it few minutes ago. In my case, I was having `main.tf` next to `terragrunt.hcl` which overwritten the module's `main.tf`.

Closing this since the example code I was using was not compatible with the latest version of Terragrunt.

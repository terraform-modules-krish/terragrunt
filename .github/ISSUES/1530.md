# Default logging hides directory listing with run-all apply

**apottere** commented *Feb 4, 2021*

When running `terragrunt run-all apply`, with the default logging the directory names are hidden, but you're still prompted to confirm you want to operate on that set of directories.

```
$ terragrunt run-all apply
Are you sure you want to run 'terragrunt apply' in each folder of the stack described above? (y/n)
```

Good point. We'll get this fixed.

# No such function timecmp

**gtmtech** commented *May 9, 2023*

**Describe the bug**

I want to use the timecmp function which was available in terraform 1.3+

**To Reproduce**

```
terragrunt.hcl:

locals {
  foo = timecmp(timestamp(), timestamp())
}
```

**Expected behavior**

foo = 0

**Nice to have**

```
ERRO[0000]                                              
ERRO[0000] There is no function named "timecmp".
```

**Versions**
- Terragrunt version: 0.45.10
- Terraform version: 1.3.2

**Additional context**

timecmp is marked as available as of terraform 1.3 and above.

I think this means that terragrunt could use an update of the most recent terraform functions

I think should be implemented missing function in `config_helpers.go`

Hi,
support for `timecmp` was added in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.45.13

# Multiple outputs into single input

**rmwpl** commented *Jan 18, 2022*

When having
```terraform
dependency "rds1" {
  config_path  = "../rds1"
}
dependency "rds2" {
  config_path  = "../rds2"
}
```
I'd like to do something along the lines of
```terraform
inputs = { 
  rds_instance_names = [dependency.rds*.outputs.instance_name]
}
```

What is the correct way to achieve this?

`dependency` is a map, so you can iterate over it. Given that, you can do something like the following:

```hcl
inputs = { 
  rds_instance_names = [
    for key, obj in dependency : 
    obj.outputs.instance_name if length(regexall("rds\\d", key)) > 0
  ]
}
```

Thanks @yorinasub17, I'll try it.

# Add ability to specify EvalContext functions before file evaluation

**hugorut** commented *Jun 27, 2023*

**Describe the solution you'd like**
The exported Terragrunt functions `ParseConfigString`, `ParseConfigFile` and `ReadTerragruntConfig` all evaluate Terragrunt config using a `hcl.EvalContext` that has been created internally by the `config.CreateTerragruntEvalContext`. This function adds all of the documented Terragrunt functions and base Terraform functions to the `EvalContext` so it can be used to evaluate expressions in Terragrunt files. As of writing there is no way to modify this `EvalContext` before expression evaluation. 

For us at @infracost, this is problematic. We don't use the Terragrunt CLI, but instead use Terragrunt as a library to build the necessary HCL configuration, which we then parse with our own native HCL logic. We do this so that users don't have to provide us cloud credentials or sensitive state. This means a number of Terragrunt functions such as `get_terraform_cli_args` or `get_aws_account_id` aren't applicable for us and can often return errors that prevent us from reading the Terragrunt configuration.

It would be great if there was a configuration option to allow `config.CreateTerragruntEvalContext` to modify the functions provided to `hcl.EvaluationContext`. I think the easiest way to achieve this would be to provide an additional field to the `options.TerragruntOptions` struct. This would enable Terragrunt package consumers to provide function overrides, or perhaps even additional functions at runtime.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Right now @infracost uses a fork with the proposed solution above. We can continue to maintain this so that it works for our use case. However, we would prefer if this functionality made it into the official repo.

**Additional context**
None - I'm going to open a PR ASAP.

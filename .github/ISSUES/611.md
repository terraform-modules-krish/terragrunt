# Inconsistent behavior of terragrunt init / apply-all / destroy-all (v0.17.1+)

**agrzegorczyk-leonsoftware** commented *Nov 23, 2018*

In our company, we encountered problems with `apply-all` and `destroy-all`, which exits with error quite often, without any specific reason.
After some investigations we found, that problem is caused by unstable behavior of module instance init procedure.
When we run `terraform init` in a loop in the same directory it fails with random frequency.

There are some logs from these loops:

The following provider constraints are not met by the currently-installed
provider plugins:

* aws (>=1.46)

Terraform can automatically download and install plugins to meet the given
constraints, but this step was skipped due to the use of -get-plugins=false
and/or -plugin-dir on the command line.

If automatic installation is not possible or desirable in your environment,
you may manually install plugins by downloading a suitable distribution package
and placing the plugin's executable file in one of the directories given in
by -plugin-dir on the command line, or in the following directory if custom
plugin directories are not set:
    terraform.d/plugins/linux_amd64

Initializing provider plugins...
[terragrunt] 2018/11/23 13:17:22 Hit multiple errors:
exit status 1
```

We also noticed, that strings `Initializing provider plugins...` and `Missing required providers.` have sometimes swapped places in an output.

We suspect, that reason of that are changes made in release v0.17.1 in function `RunShellCommandWithOutput` in file `shell/run_shell_cmd.go`, which may cause some kind of race condition while writing both, stdout and stderr of the subprocess, to common outBuf buffer. This may cause function `runTerraformCommandIfNoErrors` (`cli/cli_app.go`) not suppressing `terraform init -get=false` expected error correctly in some cases.

After downgrade to 17.0 or 16.14 we can't reproduce this bug.

Same happens to me! Very weird issue, downgraded back to 16 version!

I put in a potential fix in #613. Could you give https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.17.3 a try and see if that fixes the problem for you?

**agrzegorczyk-leonsoftware** commented *Nov 26, 2018*

Hi,
looks like this fix works as expected, we can't reproduce this bug with 0.17.3 anymore.
Thank you very much for this and quick reaction!

Fantastic, thanks for confirming!

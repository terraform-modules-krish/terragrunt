# Booleans as strings in configuration requires terragrunt to reinitialize every time

**antonbabenko** commented *Feb 16, 2018*

I've just discovered an interesting bug in how Terragrunt handles some parameters in configuration.

I have such configuration:
```hcl
terragrunt = {
   remote_state {
    backend = "s3"

    config {
      encrypt        = true
      region         = "eu-west-1"
      key            = "..."
      bucket         = "..."
      dynamodb_table = "..."

      skip_requesting_account_id  = "true"
      skip_get_ec2_platforms      = "true"
      skip_metadata_api_check     = "true"
      skip_region_validation      = "true"
      skip_credentials_validation = "true"
    }
  }
}
```

The difference is how Terragrunt handles type of `encrypt` and all other types. `encrypt` should be boolean, but all other should be type of string. When I don't use quotes around `"true"` for `skip_*` Terragrunt wants to reinitialize because configuration has changed:

```
[terragrunt] 2018/02/16 15:57:30 Backend config has changed from map[skip_metadata_api_check:true skip_region_validation:true dynamodb_table:terraform-locks-491 key:global/iam-account/terraform.tfstate skip_credentials_validation:true skip_get_ec2_platforms:true skip_requesting_account_id:true bucket:terraform-states-491 encrypt:%!s(bool=true) region:eu-west-1] to map[encrypt:%!s(bool=true) region:eu-west-1 skip_requesting_account_id:%!s(bool=true) skip_get_ec2_platforms:%!s(bool=true) skip_metadata_api_check:%!s(bool=true) skip_credentials_validation:%!s(bool=true) key:global/iam-account/terraform.tfstate bucket:terraform-states-491 dynamodb_table:terraform-locks-491 skip_region_validation:%!s(bool=true)]
```

I described [how to skip unnecessary checks on AWS](https://medium.com/@anton.babenko/make-terraform-faster-skip-unnecessary-checks-aws-and-s3-3ab00df9c3a9) and was pretty happy until I found this issue. Quoted booleans seem to work, but it would be good to fix this properly.

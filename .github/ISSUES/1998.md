# [BUG] terragrunt apply uses mock outputs

**dudicoco** commented *Jan 27, 2022*

When running `terragrunt apply` on a `terragrunt.hcl` which has a dependency block with `mock_outputs`, if the dependency does not have any outputs terragrunt uses the mock outputs values on apply instead of throwing an error.

I believe this behavior did not exist in the past and terragrunt threw an error if no outputs are found.

Hi,
will be helpful to share how dependency is defined and how terragrunt was invoked(run or run-all).

Was a set value for `mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands`?, or `skip_outputs` was enabled?

Try to use on dependency definition:
```
mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands = ["validate"]
```

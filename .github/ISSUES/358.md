# Terragrunt tests are not properly cleaning up S3 buckets after themselves

**brikis98** commented *Nov 9, 2017*

The automated tests for Terragrunt leave behind a bunch of buckets with names like `terragrunt-test-bucket-wdst9m`. We need to clean those up!

I cleaned up the buckets for now using ``for bucket in `aws s3api list-buckets | jq -r '.Buckets[] | .Name' | grep terragrunt-test-bucket`; do aws s3api delete-bucket --bucket $bucket; done``

I can confirm that 1 s3 bucket is being left over after each build. The odd thing, is I can find no mention of the bucket in the test logs? :\

For example, after deleting all test buckets, then running [530](https://circleci.com/gh/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/530), the bucket `terragrunt-test-bucket-zoqtdj` exists. I can find no occurrence of `zoqtdj` anywhere in the logs.

I see it in the logs:

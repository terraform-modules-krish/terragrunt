# terragrunt run-all hangs

**wmendes-ionos** commented *Aug 17, 2022*

Whenever I run-all with terragrunt, it consistently hangs in the completion of the call. I always have to do a ctrl+c.
I've spotted this happening also on environment of other colleagues.
I am on macos with terraform 1.1.9 and terragrunt 0.36.6.

Hi,
was tried to run Terragrunt with `--terragrunt-log-level debug --terragrunt-debug`? it may show more details on which module it hangs.

So far, using those flags, the execution completes fine, no hanging. But I am still exploring more both cases.

So in my case the problem was pending confirmation dialogs from terrafrom that I didn't see. Maybe it would make sense to automatically set `export TF_INPUT=false` when running `run-all`?

# Allow terragrunt to read environment variables from a file

**gothka** commented *Jul 17, 2021*

I'm trying to import secrets that live outside the terragrunt directory into `terragrunt child config`. Exporting environment variable works fine, but it's not optimal when running automation or locally (might forget to export env var before running `terragrunt plan/apply`). Is there a better way to set `.envrc `or something similar in the root directory so whenever terragrunt executes, all child configs can make use of the environment variable from the file.

Thanks for the suggestion! My gut feeling is that this is probably better handled by an external tool like [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv). Otherwise, using [run_cmd](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/built-in-functions/#run_cmd) to implement the secret reader is the next best alternative.

If you have a use case where neither of those work for you, we can consider a terragrunt native feature. Let us know!

Thanks for the response @yorinasub17. Direnv seems to be the right choice. I wouldn't want to use `run_cmd` in root or any other subsequent `terragrunt.hcl ` files except in child module since there're dependencies and terragrunt runs the script or `run_cmd` number of times and might hit rate limit with the third party system.  It might be worth exploring to support a native feature like `sops_decrypt` or something.

Also, i've another question, which pertains to inputs. Let's say i've two regions `us-east-1 ` and `us-west-1` and both regions use same module to provision things and most of the inputs are same between the two regions and i need to define those inputs multiple times. Is there a better way i could get some parts of the inputs (i.e., that are repeatable/identical b/w regions) from `us-east-1` and use them in `us-west-2`? This way i don't have to define multiple times and keeps the code DRY.

This is being addressed in the `imports` feature, which you can learn more about in the [RFC](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/rfc/imports/). For progress on implementation, you can follow https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1566

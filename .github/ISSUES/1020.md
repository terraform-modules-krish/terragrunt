# Add ability for a before_hook that runs before initializing remote state

**sleungcy** commented *Jan 27, 2020*

I am attempting to set up a hook before terragrunt initialize remote state to retrieve AWS credential from vault. However terragrunt just initializes the remote state before triggering the "init" before_hook..

Are there other hooks i can use that are before "init"? Is there a way I can put a hook before it runs terraform --version?

I think you want to use `init-from-module`. See the last bullet in https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/before-and-after-hooks/ for more details.

unfortunately, init-from-module also runs after the state initialization.

Gotcha. Then we don't currently support this feature, so we will need to implement it. We're unlikely to get to this anytime soon, so if you are in need of this in the short term, your best bet is to submit a PR to add support for this. Otherwise, you can wait for someone from the community or us to get around to implementing this.

Do I need an RFC for this?

Thanks for checking in on that! This is simple enough that the corresponding README updates to [the before hook docs](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/docs/_docs/02_features/before-and-after-hooks.md) is sufficient.

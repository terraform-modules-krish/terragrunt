# Proposal: bring back support for configuration in terraform.tfvars

**ekini** commented *Jul 24, 2019*

Support for `terraform.tfvars` was removed in terragrunt 0.19 only because of https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/19424

That required everyone to basically rename the file to `terragrunt.hcl` and make some other adjustments. It required creating the `inputs{}` block with the variables, which are then get converted to env vars and then to actual vars by terraform. As this transformation doesn't always work well, we have to sometimes have two files: `terraform.tfvars` and `terragrunt.hcl`, keeping the variables set in `terraform.tfvars` and terragrunt configuration set in `terragrunt.hcl`.

There have been some other features added with `terragrunt.hcl`, for example terraform functions, but they are not used always. At least I haven't found a way to use this functionality at all.

Instead, terragrunt can:

1. Check for the existence of `terraform.tfvars`. Check for the `terragrunt` variable there. If it's there then generate a file called `terragrunt.tf` with this content: `variable "terragrunt" {}`.
 This way terraform will not complain, all variables will be read correctly and there will be just one configuration file.
2. If the file is not there, check for `terragrunt.hcl` file and parse it as usual.

Moving away from `terraform.tfvars` was recommended by HashiCorp in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/466. I tend to agree, as that's a format native to Terraform, and it's likely to have other backwards incompatible changes in the future.

Moreover, I'm not a fan of code generation. It always sounds simple, but tends to introduce complexity. Just off the top of my head:

1. We have to scan for `terraform.tfvars`, parse it, find a `terragrunt` variable, then find a possible `source = "xxx"` param, then either check out `xxx` or look at the `.tf` files in the current working dir, scan all of those, parse all of those, and make sure none of them declare a `terragrunt` variable already.
1. If they don't, we have to generate a file. But where do we write it? If we put it in the current working dir, it will dirty your code base. Putting it in `.terragrunt-cache` makes more sense, but only works for users with `source = "xxx"` params that require downloading code into that dir. 
1. What if a `terragrunt.tf` already exists?
1. When do we clean up `terragrunt.tf`?

So, overall, I'm not sure this is a road we want to go down.

Closing as won't fix given that this ship has sailed.

# terragrunt-strict-validate option is not working as expected

**tstraley** commented *Aug 31, 2021*

terragrunt version v0.31.6

When running [validate-inputs](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli-options/#validate-inputs) with the strict validate flag, it does not error on unused inputs like it claims it should. Only warnings. Running in debug mode shows that it is not enabling strict checking.

That does look like a bug. Do you have any easy test case we can use to repro?

**tstraley** commented *Oct 9, 2021*

@brikis98 just add any unused input variable to any terraform code.

eg. 

`variable "foo" {}`

and run validate-inputs against it

Any updates here? Since missing variables will already be detected by failing plans and applies, `validate-inputs` without `terragrunt-strict-validate` is almost of no use.

Fixed in release v0.36.10

Apologies if this should've been a new issue, but at least the existing title fits perfectly to my issue: a `terragrunt validate-inputs --terragrunt-strict-validate` call passes, yet `terragrunt apply` fails. Here's the shortened output, using `v0.40.2` and TF `1.3.1`:

```sh
$ terragrunt validate-inputs --terragrunt-strict-validate && terragrunt apply 
INFO[0009] All variables passed in by terragrunt are in use.  prefix=[/full/path/] 
INFO[0009] All required inputs are passed in by terragrunt  prefix=[/full/path] 
Acquiring state lock. This may take a few moments...

│ Error: Missing required argument
│ ...
│ The argument "foo" is required, but no definition was found.
```
The mentioned `foo` variable definition:
```hcl
variable "foo" {
    nullable = true
    type = string
    default = null
}
```
And the `inputs = {}` doesn't have `foo` defined.

I'll try to come up with a repro. But firstly, should the above even be possible? Or am i misunderstanding the docs:
>    terragrunt-strict-validate                   Sets strict mode for the validate-inputs command. By default, strict mode is off. When this flag is passed, strict mode is turned on. When strict mode is turned off, the validate-inputs command will only return an error if required inputs are missing from all input sources (env vars, var files, etc). When strict mode is turned on, an error will be returned if required inputs are missing OR if unused variables are passed to Terragrunt.

# error refreshing state

**chenrui333** commented *Dec 5, 2018*

I have two modules `ami` and `eks`. 

`ami` is doing the encryption of the AWS public EKS AMI, while `eks` reference the result and proceed with the cluster maintenance. With AMI v25 release, I somehow run into the error refreshing state issue as below:
```
Error: Error refreshing state: 1 error(s) occurred:

* module.eks.aws_launch_configuration.workers: 1 error(s) occurred:

* module.eks.aws_launch_configuration.workers: aws_launch_configuration.workers: InvalidAMIID.NotFound: The image id '[ami-0141200bb38f52bc1]' does not exist
	status code: 400, request id: a463578f-65c1-4eda-9bf1-3171f3c6a2d2
```

I have two questions:
- how to fix the invalid AMI issue? maybe something like `terraform state rm`? Or just directly modify the S3 tf state file.
- How to specify the module to module execution sequence?

Thanks!

I ended up deleting the state and recreate the resource:
```
$ terragrunt state list
$ terragrunt state rm module.eks.aws_launch_configuration.workers
```

```
$ terragrunt plan 
$ terragrunt apply 
```

# Explicitly pass on providers from terragrunt to terraform module

**tomasbackman** commented *Sep 29, 2020*

I have some terraform modules setting up resources dynamically in multiple accounts/regions in aws, exactly which account/region should be possible to choose when using the module and not hardcoded.
To accomplish this I am creating aliased _"proxy configuration blocks"_ in the module and passing in a corresponding provider for the account/region with a providers block in the module reference when using the module. (As described in:  https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/modules.html#passing-providers-explicitly)

However in terragrunt I can not get this functionality to work. I can generate new configurations with the generate block that end up in the correct module folder, but for them to actually be used by the resources in the module they need to have the correct alias, and then they are colliding with the "proxy configurations" already defined in the module.. 
If I instead do not use the proxy configurations it works, but then I cannot use the module with pure terraform code as there is no way that I know of to dynamically create/use a provider for a module in another folder without the proxy + passing described in the linked documentation above.

The (a) solution I think would be the possibility to create/generate a provider in terragrunt, but not place it in the module and instead pass it on to the module like terraform is doing.

Another solution would be to not call modules by both terraform and terragrunt, since I can get it to work with either, but not both.. but it feels wrong to develop terraform modules and not include example folders for setting them up, and equally strange to have these examples dependent on a terraform wrapper like terragrunt or some script copying.

So if there is some way to accomplish this it would be great!

Unfortunately, this is not something terragrunt can handle in the current design, because terraform doesn't provide us the options to update providers on the CLI, env vars, or through tfvars. The only way I see terragrunt supporting this is if we implement #759, but that won't happen for a while.

Alright that is unfortunate. Thanks for prompt answer. Is there some smart known workaround? Or other suggestions? 

I find this very problematic since it is actually blocking usage of modules doing cross account/region things. At least as long as we want both terragrunt configurations and terraform examples/test to work with the same modules. (Which I have a lot of trouble imagining not wanting. A terraform module should really include some examples/test, and I think a production setup should avoid to partly use one tool/design (terragrunt) and partly another depending on the module).

We have been avoiding this issue for a while and handled things manually, but cannot much longer since these modules need to be implemented in our proper product flow as well.

How does others handle this? We surely cannot be alone with the problem.. any suggestions are welcome!

@tomasbackman We use `source = "./"` and include a main.tf with a module block that points to the real source and passes the providers.

@lorengordon Interesting solution. Then I guess the inputs from terragrunt (dependencies etc) goes through the intermediate ./main.tf with defined variables in there. Some extra code to create those extra main.tf files but not that much, I think it could work for us. Is there any other caveats with this that can be good to think of? (Like dependencies and or passing of variables needing some special care?

I will try this, or the third solution we discussed in the team today, to refactor the modules/architecture so that none use multiple accounts etc and when needed specify two terragrunt components using same module but with extra "receiver/sender" or similar inputs and "count" in resources to turn on/off resources accordingly. And of course defined dependencies in terragrunt...

Right, yeah, also need to pass-through variables in that main.tf.

And yep, another option is to refactor into multiple modules, so each one has only a single provider. I'm actually doing both, wherever I run into this multi-provider (region, account) type of pattern. Submodules that use a single provider, with a top-level module (or other wrapper submodules) providing the old single-module functionality. Actually was just working one of those refactorings today... https://github.com/plus3it/terraform-aws-tardigrade-security-hub/pull/44

Yes thank you! it worked quite well!

one thing to think of is that terragrunt cli commands like --terragrunt-source (that we use when updating a module and want to test the localy developed one instead of the one on github) will not be working for the intermediate terraform file. But then it is just to change the source in that file manually or with script when testing.

Also values for the provider ot the modules actual source is not possible to define in the terragrunt file and pass on as input variables, so configurations will be split up, but that is fine for me to get this functionality.

Thank you again @lorengordon!

@tomasbackman for the provider configs, you can use the `generate` block in the terragrunt config to write a `providers.tf` file into the terragrunt working directory (where terraform is executed). You can resolve terragrunt locals in the generate block, or include terraform vars in the generate block and pass them through inputs.

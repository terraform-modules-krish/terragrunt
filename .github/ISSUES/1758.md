# terragrunt-source - Use original module path if not specified

**phatcher** commented *Jul 28, 2021*

Currently to run against the local module I have to put the full path e.g. --terragrunt-source c:/devel/myrepo//module, what would be nice is for terragrunt to infer the value after // if I don't specify it.

Given that something similar happens on run-all already and the info is in the original source parameter, I don't think this should be  difficult to implement.

Reason is that having to specify the module means that I can't use the command history in VSCode and I keep having to override the module name as I move between directories

This is similar to part of #444

Does [`--terragrunt-source-map`](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli-options/#terragrunt-source-map) help here?

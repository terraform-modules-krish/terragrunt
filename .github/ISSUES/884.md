# "terragrunt apply-all" doesn't support -help?

**ozbillwang** commented *Oct 1, 2019*

Can't get help with command `apply-all`

    terragrunt apply-all --help

    terragrunt apply-all -help

Seems `destroy-all` doesn't support `help` option as well. 

Could we have some helps for these commands?

Due to the way the command passing works between terragrunt and terraform, this is a bit tricky to implement but definitely agreed we can improve this. A bit buried to implement this, but if anyone has cycles, would be happy to review a PR.

# Update go compatibility version

**maunzCache** commented *Apr 27, 2022*

As this project is still running i'd suggest to update its dependencies and source to the next compatible go release as go 1.16 is no longer supported since 1.18 was released which happened on 2022-03-15.

As terraform currently supports go 1.17 it would be the next viable version which should work with the dependencies.

So we require this ticket now as #2168 breaks the compatibility in types.go . It now uses UnixMicro which was added in 1.17 see https://pkg.go.dev/time#UnixMicro so the project no longer compiles with 1.16

```
$ make terragrunt 
set -xe ;\
vtag_maybe_extra=$(git describe --tags --abbrev=12 --dirty --broken) ;\
go build -o terragrunt -ldflags "-X main.VERSION=${vtag_maybe_extra}" .
+ git describe --tags --abbrev=12 --dirty --broken
+ vtag_maybe_extra=v0.38.4-2-g45c7e50a553a
+ go build -o terragrunt -ldflags -X main.VERSION=v0.38.4-2-g45c7e50a553a .

# Access denied when loading dependency state with iam_role

**ScottGuymer** commented *Jan 12, 2022*

When I have 2 Terragrunt modules with a dependency and each of them declaring the same `iam_role`. They individually work correctly but when a dependency is introduced Terragrunt is no longer able to `init` and get the remote state of the dependency.

For example I have `module-a`

```
include "root" {
  path   = find_in_parent_folders()
  expose = true
}

iam_role = include.root.locals.deployment_role

terraform {
  source = "../modules/module-a"
}
```

and `module-b`

```
include "root" {
  path   = find_in_parent_folders()
  expose = true
}

iam_role = include.root.locals.deployment_role

terraform {
  source = "../modules/module-b"
}

inputs = {
  some-value= dependency.module-a.outputs.some-value
}

dependency "module-a" {
  config_path = "../module-a"
}
```

- When I run apply on `module-a` using an account that requires the role to access the state it works.
- When I run apply on `module-b` using an account that requires the role to access the state I get an error. 

```
╷
│ Error: Failed to load state: AccessDenied: Access Denied
│       status code: 403, request id: someis, host id: someid
│
│
╵
```

However, when I run apply on `module-b` using an account that has access to the state without the role this works. 

Either I have something configured wrong somewhere, or for some reason the role is not being assumed when configuring the backend for the dependency.

@ScottGuymer I've spent some time trying to reproduce this issue without success. Does this problem happen consistently and are you able to provide minimal sample that reproduces the error?

We actually moved away from this config as it was proving to be impossible to make work.

You need to make sure that the user you are using does not have any access other than the role provided. 

For instance with my users which was also an account admin it worked fine, because it assumed the role for module-b and accessed with my default permissions for module-a.

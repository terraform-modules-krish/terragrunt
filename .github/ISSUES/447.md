# Having very odd git issue with terragrunt and git source

**lanmalkieri** commented *Mar 23, 2018*

Hey all, having an extremely odd issue with terragrunt when using a git source. 

Below is the error output with DEBUG logging enabled. I do not get this error anywhere else with any other git command/scripts/interaction. Just this specific scenario, and it appears to be totally random.

Terraform version: 0.10.8
Terragrunt version: 0.14.3
Git Version: 2.16.2

Below is the error I receive. Anyone else see anything like this?

Can you `git clone` the repo?

**lanmalkieri** commented *Mar 23, 2018*

Yeah git clone works fine, additionally on a subsequent run of the exact same command with no other changes, it works without issue. 

My original thought was some network weirdness or a local machine issue, but I am able to replicate this on multiple networks on multiple machines. Super odd, and I'm kind of at a loss at this point. 

Really my purpose here was to see if others were experiencing something similar to this error, I'm not convinced it's specific to terraform/terragrunt but the terragrunt command is the single only thing that I can get to generate/replicate this error. Which makes me wonder if there is some weird race condition or something going on.

That makes it even weirder...

Under the hood, Terragrunt just calls `terraform init` to check out the code. Terraform, in turn, should use your local `git` client. 

One thing I noticed is you listed:

```
Terraform version: 0.10.5
```

But I also see in your log output:

```
2018/03/22 22:33:48 [INFO] Terraform version: 0.10.8  44110772d9ffd0ec3589943c6d4c93c24a5fff06
```

How did you install Terragrunt? Did you use snap or asdf by any chance?
***

**lanmalkieri** commented *Mar 23, 2018*

Ah right sorry. 

I wrote a bash function because I was annoyed remembering what I had in req.tf per environment/account. 

```make() {
    if [[ -f ./requirements.tf ]]; then
        version=$(grep 'required_version' ./requirements.tf |grep -o '[0-9]\.[0-9][0-9]\.[0-9]')
        chtf ${version}
        /usr/bin/make "$@"
    else
        /usr/bin/make "$@"
    fi
}
```


So when I run terragrunt it changes version to whatever it needs to change. 

So for this run, yes it was 0.10.8. My mistake.

Wow, small world.

Christopher, is this bug still affecting you?

Curious from this line:
```
2018/03/22 22:33:48 [INFO] CLI command args: []string{"init",
 "-backend-config=dynamodb_table=terraform-locks",
 "-backend-config=profile=REDACTED",
 "-backend-config=bucket=REDACTED-terraform-REDACTED-dev",
 "-backend-config=key=cms/terraform.tfstate",
 "-backend-config=region=us-west-2",
 "-backend-config=encrypt=true",
 "-from-module=git::ssh://git@github.com/REDACTED/terraform?ref=master",
 "/Users/home/.terragrunt/viPWZDclNlH0zcsF3yoMY038LyM/5IJW0DEIIMMzO4MOEPUco2z_5rY"}
```
Does your user actually have write access to create `/Users/home/.terragrunt/` or is that path a product of redacting the output, and your example is actually closer to `/Users/home/$USER/.terragrunt/` in practice?

**lanmalkieri** commented *Sep 15, 2018*

Ah yes. It is a small world. 

Yeah that's not the issue. What this ended up being (I should have closed this) was the pack files in the remote repo got to like 3gb. It looked like someone accidentally committed a very large file to the remote source, and for whatever reason terraform choked out when cloning that. I cleaned up the pack files and boom. No more issues.

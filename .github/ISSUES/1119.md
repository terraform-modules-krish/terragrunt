# Can't download remote local repo?

**tmpm697** commented *Apr 6, 2020*

I setup remote local repo to download but it's failed.

In `terragrunt.hcl` file:
```
terraform {
  source = "git::myname@localhost:/home/user/modules.git//mysql?ref=v0.1.5"
}
```

When I try `terragrunt plan`, result:
```
[terragrunt] 2020/04/06 17:26:39 Downloading Terraform configurations from git::file:///home/user/...
[terragrunt] 2020/04/06 17:26:39 Hit multiple errors:
error downloading 'file:///home/user/...  /usr/bin/git exited with 128: Cloning into '/home/user/...
fatal: '/home/user/... does not appear to be a git repository
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
```

remote repos is initilized with `git init --bare myrepo.git`

I have rights setup correctly, tried with other clone.

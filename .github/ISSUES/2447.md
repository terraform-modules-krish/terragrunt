# Terragrunt with local modules

**kevinashaw** commented *Feb 14, 2023*

I'm not sure if cross-posting is allowed here.  I'm just not sure if I should post here or at Stackoverflow with questions.
Here is a link to an error I am getting as discussed in StackOverflow:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75445376/terragrunt-with-local-modules
If this is frowned-upon I will delete this question or I can move the question from SO to this site.  
Thank you for your consideration.

The problem was a git user-error.

# Generate to allow "merge" strategy

**fabioaraujopt** commented *Mar 30, 2023*

We have currently the generate feature which for cases of `if_exists` it allows:

- `overwrite `
- `overwrite_terragrunt`
- `error`
- `skip`

Why not an extra option which is to merge both files into one?

My use case is the following, the root terragrunt.hcl generates required_providers for all the modules it imports:

```
generate "versions" {
  if_exists = "skip"
  path      = "versions.tf"
  contents  = <<EOF
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = ">= 4.16.0"
    }
(....)
```

I may need specific providers for a certain module, I'd like to have a `versions.tf` file inside the module which could be merged with this generated one.

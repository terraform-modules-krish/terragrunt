# Terragrunt module prefix and JSON output

**asvinours** commented *Apr 19, 2023*

We recently enabled the `TERRAGRUNT_INCLUDE_MODULE_PREFIX` environment variable in our Gitlab-CI pipelines and realized that when using `terragrunt show --json`, the JSON output also gets prefixed with the module path.

This caused `jq` to be unable to parse the JSON output and crashed with `parse error: Invalid numeric literal at line 1, column 58` error.

We have added an `unset TERRAGRUNT_INCLUDE_MODULE_PREFIX` command before running `show -json`, but maybe one enhancement could be to not add the prefix when the `-json` flag is specified.

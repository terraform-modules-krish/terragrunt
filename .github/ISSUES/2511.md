# Terragrunt destroy takes very long becuase of git show-toplevel

**dustyhorizon** commented *Apr 2, 2023*

Hello,

I have a monorepo with several terragrunt deployments. When I want to destroy a specific terragrunt resource via `terragrunt destroy`, terragrunt takes a very long time to resolve for affected dependencies to destroy because it crawls for affected dependencies via `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`. This makes a simple resource destruction take ~10mins which is a really long time.

Is there a smarter way to do this? Maybe by specifying a boundary of which to crawl for dependencies?

We also affected by `terragrunt destroy` takes long time issue, `terragrunt apply` is not affected and is near instant.

terragrunt version 0.51.6

When running `terragrunt destroy --terragrunt-log-level debug` we can see that
terragrunt goes through every child directory in the repo and evaluates locals, which takes time.


We are not using dependencies much, and as a workardound, we've done the following:

```
mkdir $REPO_ROOT/0-terragrunt-destroy-workaround
tee $REPO_ROOT/0-terragrunt-destroy-workaround/terragrunt.hcl <<EOF >/dev/null
locals {
  raise = get_env("DOES_NOT_EXIST")
}
EOF
```
The workaround causes terragrunt to fail early the "evaluate all locals" stage, but
doesn't seem to affect destroy/apply commands and it's working fine from what we can tell.


Why terragrunt tries to evaluate all locals in every child directory when doing destroy even when no dependencies are used?

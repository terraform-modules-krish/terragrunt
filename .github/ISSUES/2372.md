# Assuming an IAM Role Using A Web Identity

**FabioAntunes** commented *Nov 25, 2022*

With terraform we can do this:

> If provided with a role ARN and a token from a web identity provider, the AWS Provider will attempt to assume this role using the supplied credentials.
> 
> Usage:
> ```
> provider "aws" {
>   assume_role_with_web_identity {
>     role_arn                = "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/ROLE_NAME"
>     session_name            = "SESSION_NAME"
>     web_identity_token = "MY_TOKEN"
>   }
> }
> ```

How can we achieve the same with Terragrunt? 

```
terragrunt plan --terragrunt-iam-role=arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/ROLE_NAME
```
Doesn't work as this still expects `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

So it seems that the AWS SDK doesn't provide a way to work with tokens only with token files.

If we set the 3 ENV vars 
`AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE`, `AWS_ROLE_ARN` and `AWS_ROLE_SESSION_NAME` then terragrunt will just follow the default [behaviour of the SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html#envvars-list-AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE)

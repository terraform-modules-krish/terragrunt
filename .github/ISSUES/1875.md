# Terragrunt run-all init --upgrade is inconsistent regarding use of the shared-cache.

**Houlistonm** commented *Oct 15, 2021*

We have two use cases where we run the `terragrunt init --upgrade`
1) we topo-sort our layers and run `terragrunt init --upgrade --terragrunt-working-dir ${LAYER} (and other commands)
2) we run `terragrunt run-all init --ugprade` 

For both use cases, we preload the shared cache with the set of providers we've tested and are now deploying.

Use case 1 is rock solid, finds every module in the shared cache and completes successfully. (only one layer is ever in flight)
Use case 2 is flaky.  Snippets from the logs are blow

The AWS provider was downloaded VS used from the cache.
This is just an example of the failure, the error is random with respect to which provider(s) are re-used vs downloaded.

Suffering from very similar problem

I believe this is a Terraform bug: it has race condition between two `terraform init` trying to install the same provider same version. First it calls `installFromHTTPURL` and it downloads to a temporary file with random name, but then it calls `installFromLocalArchive` and this unpacks directly to global plugins cache directory - this is there race condition occurs.

As per [this comment](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31964#issuecomment-1271597992) - this is expected behavior, so maybe `terraform init` should not be done in parallel by terragrunt.

If a change is made to run init serially, it would be nice to put that behind a cli-arg instead of making it the default. We pre-populate the plugin_cache_dir when we run terragrunt, using a provider mirror, so the plugins are already present and parallel init calls do not step on each other.

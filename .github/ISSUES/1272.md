# Regenerated backend line order changes on each run

**bondsbw** commented *Jul 30, 2020*

I use `overwrite_terragrunt` on my backend configurations:

```hcl
remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  generate = {
    path      = "backend.tf"
    if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  }

  config = {
    ...
  }
}
```

Each time Terragrunt regenerates the `backend.tf` file, it generates the configuration lines in a different order.  Since I'm storing `backend.tf` in source control, this shows as a change each time.

As for why I store `backend.tf` in source control, it allows members of my team to run Terraform without Terragrunt.

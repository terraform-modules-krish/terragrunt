# Allow to ignore dependency order when using Terragrunt plan-all

**JeanFred** commented *Sep 18, 2019*

When using terragrunt `plan-all`, terragrunt will smartly run the plans according to the dependency tree, parallelizing as much as possible.
Additionally, when using `exclude-dir`, terragrunt will not run the downstream layers of the excluded layers.

This makes perfect sense for `apply-all` and `destroy-all`, however it should not really matter for `plan-all` since the state is not altered between the plans. 

This is a proposal to “Allow to ignore the dependency tree”, for these two purposes:
- to run all layers in parallel
- to run the downstream layers of excluded layers

Our use case is for testing on a CI server:
- running all layers in parallel would save a couple minutes.
- because reasons, we cannot plan some layers in CI (insufficient permissions), however we can plan other layers which depend on them.

(happy to split into two tickets if that’s better)

That's a great point. PR to change this behavior is very welcome!

@brikis98 Thanks for the answer − I may try my hand at filing a PR for this :)

To clarify, what should the outcome be?
* the current default behaviour of `plan-all` is changed to ignore the tree
* a new flag/env var changes the behaviour of `plan-all` with both changes (all in parallel, still running dependencies of skipped layers)
* two different flag/env var changes the behaviour of `plan-all`

It's possible some users will need `plan-all` to run in dependency order: e.g., perhaps they have before/after hooks that do something important and won't work if it's all in parallel.

So, a `--terragrunt-ignore-dependency-tree` flag is probably the right approach. Thx!

For clarity, I’ve split off the second part in #905. Closing this as resolved then!

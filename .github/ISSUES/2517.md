# fix parsing cache key construction

**untcha** commented *Apr 5, 2023*

**Preface**

With terragrunt v0.38.9 our HCL parsing cache contribution from issue #2203 (PR #2204) was added to terragrunt which improved the parsing speed of HCL files by introducing an in-memory cache:
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.38.9

For detailed information, please refer to #2203 and #2204

**Motivation for this issue**

During our daily work, we encountered that the new parsing cache key has a bug which occurs only in certain, rare conditions.
Specifically, it only occurs if a Terragrunt module .hcl file depends on itself in a different folder, which was previously not the case and therefor couldn't been tested in our environments.

**Solution**

Adding a missing parameter (`filename`) in the cache key construction of `TerragruntConfigFromPartialConfigString`:

Stripped snippet to demonstrate the change:

``` go
func TerragruntConfigFromPartialConfigString(...) (...) {
...
- var cacheKey = fmt.Sprintf("%#v-%#v-%#v", configString, includeFromChild, decodeList)
+ var cacheKey = fmt.Sprintf("%#v-%#v-%#v-%#v", filename, configString, includeFromChild, decodeList)
...
}
```

Implementation will be provided in the following Pull Request: #2518

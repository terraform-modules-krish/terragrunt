# aws-provider-patch data types

**yorinasub17** commented *Jun 9, 2021*

The `aws-provider-patch` command converts list inputs to a string, causing problems when the values are replaced.

E.g, `terragrunt aws-provider-patch --terragrunt-override-attr allowed_account_ids=["0000012345636"]` sets the `allowed_account_ids` to `"[0000012345636]"`.

Thanks for filing this! Just to clarify, it appears `aws-provider-patch` strips the inner string `"0000012345636"` in the conversion, causing `allowed_account_ids=["0000012345636"]` to format to `allowed_account_ids=[0000012345636]`

Ah thanks for the clarification! Updated the OP description to include that.

Using the latest service catalog `v0.41.3` I'm seeing a new resource, `logs-account-resources.tf` at the root of the cache directory for `account-baseline-root` which is not patched by the `aws-provider-patch` command and must be edited manually before attempting an import. Its provider block is below:

```
provider "aws" {
  alias  = "logs"
  region = var.aws_region

  assume_role {
    role_arn = local.has_logs_account && local.logs_account_id != "" ? "arn:aws:iam::${local.logs_account_id}:role/${local.logs_account_role_name}" : null
  }
}
```

Just released a fix for the OP issue in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.30.0. Binaries will show up shortly.

@yorinasub17 thanks for the new release! I can confirm it fixes the issue except in `logs-account-resources.tf` I documented at https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1709#issuecomment-859015761.

Below is the error log:
```

This specific issue should be fixed. Don't remember why I reopened this ticket, but no further action is needed on the original ticket. The issue about the account-baseline module should be an issue in that repo.

@yorinasub17 did you open another issue for the service catalog?

I'm also still seeing this:

Hi, please open a new ticket in `terraform-aws-service-catalog`, with details on what steps you took to end up with that error and we can take a look. Thanks!

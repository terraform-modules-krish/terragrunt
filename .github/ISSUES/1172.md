# Terragrunt after_hook for apply called during output

**WigglesMcMuffin** commented *May 8, 2020*

When calling terragrunt apply-all on a service (mod1) with a `dependency` block defined (mod2), the `after_hook` of mod2 is called twice. Once when it is applied, and then again when `terraform output -json` is called on it to apply mod1.

This are what I think are the useful bits of the apply log. You can see that mod2 is applied, then mod1 reads that it's a dependent, and goes back into mod2 runs the `terraform output -json` command, at which point the hook fires again, and fails.

the parent hcl files looks like this:
```
terraform {
  extra_arguments "create_plan_files" {
    commands = [
      "plan",
    ]
    arguments = [
      "-out=${get_terragrunt_dir()}/tfplan",
    ]
  }
  after_hook "migrate_tfplan" {
    commands = ["apply"]
    execute = ["mv", "${get_terragrunt_dir()}/tfplan", "${get_terragrunt_dir()}/tfplan.success"]
    run_on_error = false
  }
}
```

Can upload the whole test setup to a repo, or somewhere if it helps.

EDIT:
Terraform: 0.12.20
Terragrunt: 0.22.4
I didn't see any issues reported that looked like this, so I assumed it hadn't been patched in the most, most up to date version of terragrunt, but can check if that helps

This does sound like a bug! I suspect the hooks are running whether a module is being called directly or just being used for outputs as part of a `dependency` block. If anyone has time to dig into this and submit a PR, we'd probably want (a) to pass some flag along when fetching outputs as part of a `dependency` block and (b) to update the [shouldRunHook method](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/cli/cli_app.go#L447) to return `false` if that flag was passed.

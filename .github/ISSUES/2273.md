# Pass `Env` to `cfgOptions` in `FindWhereWorkingDirIsIncluded`

**jlepere-everlaw** commented *Sep 12, 2022*

In #1823, functionality was added to check module dependencies during destroy operations. This included creating [a fresh `TerragruntOptions` object](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1823/files#diff-2ce1e65bb8a23011007dae779c8bacbc45d28560b1bc4e7dc1079f52fd22cf14R504) which, by default, has [an empty map for the `Env` attribute](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/7788a525ab61641211e3f8a127ed53b450e96bc8/options/options.go#L256). This means we're losing all environment variables when checking for dependencies.

This causes the validation to fail for my organization for all destroy operations. Fortunately, this doesn't cause the `destroy` operation to crash, but I think it would be good to fix nonetheless.

I think we can add the following to resolve this.

I've tested locally and verified the fix with `$ go run main.go destroy --terragrunt-working-dir ...` after cloning the repo. I'd like to submit a PR for this, but I don't have permissions to push.

Sorry, I didn't know how to submit a PR to a public repository. I've created https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/2274 after help from @kmurphy4.

# Hooks are not merged when including parent config

**dtryon** commented *Apr 27, 2018*

Hello.  First of all, I'm a new user of terragrunt and I really like the direction it is headed.  It is saving us a lot of time, so thank you!

I think I've spotted an issue with the new `*_hook` feature.

We are set up like the live example where we have possible `terraform` blocks in the parent and module directories.

I'm expecting to be able to add `before_hood` and `after_hook` in the child `terraform.tfvars` (inside the module) at the same time as using `include`, however, it seems the hooks aren't merged up.

I think there is a missing merge for hooks here (this line is where `extra_arguments` are handled):
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/config/config.go#L316

For now, we can work around this by copying the `extra_arguments` block to all child config files, but it would be great if it would merge up correctly.

Thank you.

Example child config:

```
terragrunt = {
    terraform {
        source = "../awesome-module"

        before_hook "before" {
            commands = [ "apply", "plan" ]
            execute = [
                "echo", "Foo"
            ]
            run_on_error = false
        }

        after_hook "after" {
            commands = [ "apply", "plan" ]
            execute = [
                "echo", "Bar"
            ]
            run_on_error = true
        }
    }

    include {
        path = "${find_in_parent_folders()}"
    }
}
```

Example parent config:

```
terragrunt = {

  remote_state {
    backend = "s3"

    config {
      bucket  = "tfstate"
      key     = "us-east-1/${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
      region  = "us-east-1"
      encrypt = true
      acl     = "private"
      profile = "awesome-profile"
    }
  }

  terraform {
  
    extra_arguments "custom_vars" {
      commands = ["${get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars()}"]
      optional_var_files = [
        "${get_tfvars_dir()}/${find_in_parent_folders("account.tfvars", "ignore")}"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Ah, you're right, we missed this, and `mergeConfigWithIncludedConfig` is exactly where it should be added. Thanks for reporting! @dtryon Would you be up for a PR to fix this?

Sure, I can prepare a PR for this :)

However, what should happen if there are "intermediate" config files (between parent and child) OR if there are hooks in *both* the parent and child config files.  Implementing the merge rules from `extra_arguments` seems overkill for this.  I could see 2 potential ways to go for a simple implementation.

1. If there are in more that one hook defined - throw
2. Always override from the child upwards (child wins).

@brikis98 thoughts?

Only one level of includes is currently supported (child + parent), so the only possibilities are:

1. No hooks anywhere
1. Hooks in the child
1. Hooks in the parent
1. Hooks in child + parent

The last item is the only one to think through. I see three options:

1. Append all the hooks together. Simple, but does not allow any way to override behavior.
1. Child hooks override all parent hooks. Simple, but limits reuse.
1. Append all hooks together, with the caveat where a child hook overrides a parent hook _if they have the same name_. This is slightly more complicated, but seems like the most intuitive option. 

What do you think?

Thanks @brikis98

I think that sounds the best option.

I think that Appending them all together might give unexpected results if named hooks are repeated with different logic (not sure what would happen).

I'll look at it over the weekend :+1:

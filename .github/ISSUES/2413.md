# Last build 0.42.8 missing files to download

**pipoe2h** commented *Jan 13, 2023*

The last build is missing the SHA256SUMS and the rest of the tar files. Noticed this because the Terraform feature for VS Code Devcontainer has terragrunt enabled by default to the latest. Because the latest exists as a release in the repo, it is picking it up but the files are missing.

We are also facing issues due to this, we use the next binary that is missing:

https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/latest/download/terragrunt_linux_amd64

Hi,
looking into, seems to be an issue with the release artifacts publication

@mrsaiz if you are using Devcontainer too, what I've done in the interim is to set the feature to the previous release. Here is an extract for the devcontainer.json:

```
	"features": {
		"ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/terraform:1": {
			"version": "1.3.7",
			"tflint": "0.44.1",
			"terragrunt": "0.42.7"
		}
	}
```

Thanks, we are using a similar workaround. We were downloading the binary with the next command:
`curl -sSLO "https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/latest/download/terragrunt_linux_amd64"`

As that link is not working, we are downloading the binary from the previous version using the next command:
`curl -sSLO "https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/download/v0.42.7/terragrunt_linux_amd64"`

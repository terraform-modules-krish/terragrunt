# Issues when Excluding Dependency Dirs

**robarthur** commented *Mar 24, 2021*

Terraform version: `Terraform v0.14.2`
Terragrunt version: `terragrunt version v0.28.7`

I'm seeing unexpected behaviour when I try to use the following flags with either a `run-all` or a `destroy-all`:

```
--terragrunt-exclude-dir
--terragrunt-ignore-external-dependencies
```

Specifically I can't prevent dependencies that are outside of my current working directory from being included in `*-all` commands.

I have a setup that looks like this:

```
aws/customer-account/vpc/
aws/customer-account/transit-gateway-attachment/

aws/networking-account/vpc/
aws/networking-account/transit-gateway/
```

The customer account transit-gateway-attachment has dependencies on the networking account VPC and Transit Gateway.  But when if I run a `terragrunt run-all destroy` from the `aws/customer-account/` directory, I _don't_ want to destroy any resources in the networking account.

What I tried (some info modified/redacted...):

```
ubuntu@machine:/aws/customer-account/$ terragrunt run-all destroy --terragrunt-ignore-external-dependencies
INFO[0000] Stack at  /aws/customer-account:
  => Module  /aws/networking-account/transit_gateway (excluded: false, dependencies: [ /aws/networking-account/])
  => Module  /aws/networking-account/ (excluded: false, dependencies: [])
  => Module  /aws/customer-account /transit_gateway_attachment (excluded: false, dependencies: [ /aws/networking-account/transit_gateway,  /aws/customer-account /vpc])
  => Module  /aws/customer-account /vpc (excluded: false, dependencies: []) 
WARNING: Are you sure you want to run `terragrunt destroy` in each folder of the stack described above? There is no undo! (y/n) n
```

```
ubuntu@machine:/aws/customer-account$ terragrunt run-all destroy --terragrunt-exclude-dir */networking-account/*
Module /aws/customer-account/transit_gateway_attachment depends on module /aws/networking-account/transit_gateway, which is an external dependency outside of the current working directory. Should Terragrunt run this external dependency? Warning, if you say 'yes', Terragrunt will make changes in /aws/networking-account/transit_gateway as well! (y/n) n
```

I'd expect, based on the docs that in both cases those external dependencies would be excluded?  It's possible in the first instance that those dependencies would have been excluded, but the output makes me think they wouldn't be.. `(excluded: false`)

I tried an explicit include as well... and seeing similar behaviour:

e.g.

```
$ terragrunt run-all destroy --terragrunt-include-dir ${PWD}
Module /aws/customer-account/transit_gateway_attachment depends on module /aws/networking-account/transit_gateway, which is an external dependency outside of the current working directory. Should Terragrunt run this external dependency? Warning, if you say 'yes', Terragrunt will make changes in /aws/networking-account/transit_gateway as well! (y/n) n

Module /aws/networking-account/transit_gateway depends on module /aws/networking-account/vpc, which is an external dependency outside of the current working directory. Should Terragrunt run this external dependency? Warning, if you say 'yes', Terragrunt will make changes in /aws/networking-account/vpc as well! (y/n) n
```

Edit:

Seeing the same behaviour with `--terragrunt-strict-include`

Hm, that's odd. `--terragrunt-ignore-external-dependencies` should do what you want...

Could you [turn up the log level](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli-options/#terragrunt-log-level) and share the full log output?

@brikis98 Thanks for getting back.  I turned the log level down to debug, see below.  I redacted slightly less info this time, but hopefully it's still clear/relevant to the example above:

Hey @brikis98 I was wondering if there's was any more you could glean from he output above or anything you'd recommend trying?

**brikis98** commented *Apr 2, 2021*

Hm, that does seem like a bug. Unfortunately, I can't see from the log output what the cause is. We're buried at the moment, so if anyone has time to dig into this, a PR is very welcome.

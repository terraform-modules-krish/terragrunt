# run_cmd caching could be improved when used in top-level includes

**joemiller** commented *Jul 8, 2022*

Consider a monorepo structure like:

```
terraform/stacks
|__ root.terragrunt.hcl
   |__ prod
     |__ web/terragrunt.hcl
...
```

Where `root.terragrunt.hcl` is included by all stacks and you have ~300 stacks.

If you have any `run_cmd()` calls in the root, they will be executed once for every stack because the caching logic uses the directory of the `terragrunt.hcl` file as the cache key: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/config/config_helpers.go#L296

If you have a couple run_cmd's and hundreds of stacks this adds up to a considerable number of forks to run these commands before terragrunt starts to run any TF commands. This makes even `run-all` against only a few stacks a long process.

I don't know the best solution here. Some ideas:

1. New flag to `run_cmd` to force a "run once" behavior
2. some other flag to influence the cache key

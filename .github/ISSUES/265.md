# Supplying custom terraform binary via --terragrunt-tfpath breaks terraform

**jcharette** commented *Aug 16, 2017*

Supplying the --terragrunt-tfpath= argument to terragrunt breaks terraform.  The variable is passed down to the terraform spawn, and then terraform fails due to invalid arguments.

example:
> ./terragrunt_darwin_amd64 plan-all --terragrunt-tfpath=`pwd`/terraform

[terragrunt] [/Users/jcharette/vbustash/ox/tf_live/dev/alb] 2017/08/16 07:28:39 Running command: terraform plan -var-file=/Users/jcharette/vbustash/ox/tf_live/dev/alb/terraform.tfvars --terragrunt-tfpath=/Users/jcharette/vbustash/ox/tf_live/dev/terraform
[terragrunt] [/Users/jcharette/vbustash/ox/tf_live/dev/alb] 2017/08/16 07:28:39 Module /Users/jcharette/vbustash/ox/tf_live/dev/alb has finished with an error: exit status 1

Running the same plan without the --terragrunt-tfpath argument succeeds with no errors.

Sounds like a bug! Teragrunt args should be filtered out here: 

https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/cli/args.go#L138

Perhaps something broke with that code. PRs are welcome!

I am running into the same issue. If I use --terragrunt-tfpath=xxx before plan, I get 

`Incorrect Usage. flag provided but not defined: -terragrunt-tfpath`

But, if I pass 'path' _before_ the terragrunt flag, it gets passed to the terraform command.

Don't know if it's related but Yori asked me to log it.  Basically Trying using --terragrunt-tfpath seems to fail while using TERRAGRUNT_PATH, things work better. He said "hat definitely looks like a bug. Specifically, it looks like we forgot to mark `terragrunt-tfpath` as a terragrunt specific arg. Can you file an issue in the Github repo (https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt)? In the meantime, can you try using the environment variable `TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH` (and setting it to `/usr/local/bin/tfpath/0.11.7/terraform`) as a workaround? (edited) "

Updating this issue, the flag `--terragrunt-tfpath` is passed down to terraform and still breaking, only works with the `TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH` env variable, tested on *v0.19.8*

The bug appeared today for me as well. Setting the environmental variable `TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH` worked. Thanks @xyklex

While this particular bug still exists, there is a new workaround now: you can set the `terraform_binary` attribute to control from `terragrunt.hcl` as well (https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt#terraform_binary)

Still an issue:
```
terragrunt_v0.29.2 --terragrunt-tfpath "/usr/local/bin/terraform_0.15.1" terragrunt-info
Incorrect Usage. flag provided but not defined: -terragrunt-tfpath
```

**yorinasub17** commented *May 24, 2021*

@Tarasovych Terragrunt flags must come after the command, so you need to do `terragrunt_v0.29.2 terragrunt-info --terragrunt-tfpath "/usr/local/bin/terraform_0.15.1"`.

# ERRO[0007] if all .tf files are generated

**tiwood** commented *Aug 23, 2021*

We have a folder where only one `terragrunt.hcl` exists, everything else is generated with Terragrunt (including Backend config), example:

```
.
├── backend.generated.tf
├── modules.generated.tf
└── terragrunt.hcl
```

Unfortunately we get an error `ERRO[0007] Did not find any Terraform files (*.tf) in xyz`.

It seems Terragrunt checks the existance of `*.tf` files before the `generated` files are created, which results in the error message above.

This is the debug output of a `failed` run:

```
DEBU[0003] run_cmd output: [REDACTED]
DEBU[0003] Evaluated 1 locals (remaining 0): cpfactory
DEBU[0003] Did not find any locals block: skipping evaluation.
DEBU[0003] [Partial] Included config /xyz/terragrunt.hcl has strategy shallow merge: merging config in (shallow).
DEBU[0003] Running command: terraform --version          prefix=[xyz]

ERRO[0007] Did not find any Terraform files (*.tf) in xyz
ERRO[0007] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1
```

If the run is successful (because I've added a empty `test.tf` file), we can see the code is generated:
```
DEBU[0007] The file path xyz .terraform-version already exists and if_exists for code generation set to "skip". Will not regenerate file.
DEBU[0007] Generated file xyz/terraform.generated.tf.
DEBU[0007] Generated file xyz/providers.generated.tf.
DEBU[0007] Generated file xyz/modules.generated.tf.
```

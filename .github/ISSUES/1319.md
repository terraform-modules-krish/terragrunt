# Inconsistent resolution of path in `sops_decrypt_file`

**lukiffer** commented *Aug 27, 2020*

Given the following block, when running `terragrunt apply` in the module directory the path resolves correctly and works, however running a `terragrunt apply-all` from the root directory fails:

```hcl
locals {
  example = yamldecode(sops_decrypt_file("${path_relative_from_include()}/../../example/secrets.yaml"))
}
```

The resulting error when running `terragrunt apply-all`:

> `Call to function "sops_decrypt_file" failed: Failed to read "../../../../../../example/secrets.yaml": open ../../../../../../example/secrets.yaml: no such file or directory.`

If I replace `sops_decrypt_file(...)` with a simple `file(...)` the apply works (albeit with encrypted values). There appears to be inconsistent resolution of the path between these two functions and/or an inconsistency between the former's implementation in `apply` and `apply-all`.

After a bit more debugging, it appears that `sops_decrypt_file(...)` expects a path relative to `$PWD` rather than relative to the location of the `terragrunt.hcl`. This isn't expected â€“Â especially given the behaviour of `file(...)`, and isn't documented.

Happy to contribute a documentation update if this is the intended behaviour, but I don't have the bandwidth to do a PR for changes to the functionality and corresponding tests. ðŸ˜¢ 

As a workaround, instead of using `path_relative_from_include()` I'm using a path relative of `get_parent_terragrunt_dir()` which isn't ideal in all scenarios, but works for this specific case.

Could we give some love to this issue? It is also causing problems when referencing a module that uses `sops_decrypt_file` as a dependency. A workaround I found is to wrap a call to this function with a `try` statement:
```hcl
locals {
    secrets = try(yamldecode(sops_decrypt_file("secrets.enc.yaml")), {})
}
```

Your solution `try` function always gets a fallback value `{}`.

My solution:
```terraform
locals {
  secrets  = yamldecode(sops_decrypt_file("${get_terragrunt_dir()}/secrets.enc.yaml"))
}
```

Also ran into this issue, when trying to use `sops_decrypt_file` with `path_relative_from_include` in an "intermediate" terragrunt include.
It works as expected with `file`, but not with `sops_decrypt_file`.

It would make sense to change `sops_decrypt_file` to accept the same type of path as `file`.
But this would probably be a breaking change.

However, IMO, it seems like bad practice to rely on relative paths in this kind of case.
Using absolute paths should be preferred when pointing to a file.
Relative paths should only be used when generating dynamic configuration, like defining path to tfstate in backend.

It seems like `get_terragrunt_dir` will be acceptable in my case, as it renders an absolute path. Using the suggested `get_parent_terragrunt_dir` might work too, but struggling to understand the difference there. It seems to give more inconsistent results when used with more complex include structures. It does in fact not return the path to a directory containing `terragrunt.hcl` file in my case, as the documentation states.

I have to say, sometimes it can be pretty difficult to understand the purpose of all the various Terragrunt path functions, and which one is correct/appropriate in different cases. The examples in the documentation are very simplistic, compared to the real world projects where Terragrunt actually is relevant.

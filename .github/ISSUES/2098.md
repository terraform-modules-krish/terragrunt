# Provide method to add tags to the accesslogs s3 bucket

**nniehoff** commented *May 6, 2022*

The `remote_state` configuration block currently allows specifying `accesslogging_bucket_name` for s3 remote state.  This is a feature request to add the capability to add tags to this bucket `accesslogging_bucket_tags` for example, similar to `s3_bucket_tags`.

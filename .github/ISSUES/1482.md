# Replace multierror implementation with go-multierror

**infraredgirl** commented *Jan 6, 2021*

Terragrunt currently implements its own [multierror package](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/errors/multierror.go). We should scrap this and use [go-multierror](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-multierror) instead.

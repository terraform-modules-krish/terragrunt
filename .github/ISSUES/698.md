# Parallelism of terragrunt *-all commands

**ondrejklucka** commented *May 6, 2019*

Hi

When running our infra (100s of modules), too many processes get spawned at once and we start hitting memory issues among others.

Is there a way to limit number of processes spawned when running terragrunt *-all commands?
Also, tried Terraform's `-parallelism=n`, but with no luck.

Best regards
Ondrej

Thanks @brikis98 for the quick reply.

We have tested #636 (as mentioned above, on large infra of 100s of modules) and it seems to be working as expected.

# Terragrunt rebranding

**ansromanov** commented *Sep 21, 2023*

Yesterday, the Linux Foundation announced the formation of [OpenTofu](http://opentofu.org/).
As far as I understand, Terragrunt will not support Terraform versions after 1.5.5 and will switch to OpenTofu.

So, are there any plans to rename `Terragrunt` itself, for example to `Tofugrunt`, which makes a strong association with OpenTofu, not Terraform?

Where did you read about Terragrunt dropping support for Terraform after version 1.5.5

There is an issue for adding support for OpenTofu: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/2690

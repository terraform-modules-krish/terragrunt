# gob: encoded unsigned integer out of range error

**jeffPOG** commented *Jul 12, 2023*

I am currently trying to run a terraform project and I have been getting this weird output message anytime I do anything with terragrunt. For example

**To Reproduce**
When I run `terragrunt validate` on any of my terragrunt files I get the following:

```
    ERRO[0000] 1 error occurred:
        * error downloading 'file:///home/vagrant/iac/terraform': gob: encoded unsigned integer out of range
```
I'm not certain what the cause of this could be considering I am not running a golang application or file at all. 

While troubleshooting I did a `df -h` anf got the following:

 
```
    Filesystem               Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on

vagrant                  477G  198G  279G  42% /vagrant
```
majority of what I'm doing is under `/vagrant` but I wonder if the other filesystems that at capacity have anything to do with that.

**Versions**
- Terragrunt version: v0.48.1
- Terraform version: v1.5.3
- Linux: fedora .37

Hi,
can be shared full execution log with `--terragrunt-log-level debug` argument?

`gob: encoded unsigned integer out of range` usually is thrown from Go when something is wrong with read data.

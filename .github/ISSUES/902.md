# Build with a more recent version of terraform

**johanfleury** commented *Oct 9, 2019*

# Description

As a way to work around [Terraform not supporting setting variables that are not declared in root modules anymore](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/19424) and [Terragrunt not supporting multiple include's level](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/303), we were trying to use the `regexall` function to create “conditional `extra_arguments` block” (see example below).

The `regexall` function was introduced in Terraform version 0.12.7, but is not present in Terragrunt has it is built with [Terraform version 0.12.6](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/Gopkg.toml#L82)

# Current behavior

With the following `terragrunt.hcl`:

```
terraform {
  extra_arguments "gcp_vars" {
    commands = length(regexall("^foobar/.+", get_terragrunt_dir())) > 0 ? get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars() : []

    arguments = [
      "-var", "foobar=${get_terragrunt_dir()}/../../foo.bar"
    ]
  }
}
```

Terragrunt fails with:

```
[terragrunt] 2019/10/09 10:50:48 Error processing module at '[SNIPPED]/projects/foo/bar/ca/terragrunt.hcl'. How this module was found: Terragrunt config file found in a subdirectory of [SNIPPED]/projects/foo/bar/. Underlying error: [SNIPPED]/projects/terragrunt.hcl:25,23-31: Call to unknown function; There is no function named "regexall"., and 1 other diagnostic(s)
```

# Expected behavior

Terragrunt should be able to execute `regexall`.

# Proposed fix

Update the terraform version constraint to at least [0.12.7 (released in august 2019)](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0127-august-22-2019).

Also, it would be great to add the Terraform version on which Terragrunt was built in the output of `terragrunt --version`.

PR welcome!

I can do the PR if all it takes is changing the constraint in Gopkg.toml and validating that build/tests still work.

I was just wondering, what do you think would be the best way to keep in sync with Terraform in the future? Would it be possible and/or wanted to build Terragrunt with the latest version of Terraform?

[Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/) does a great job of making it easy...

Terraform is pre 1.0.0 and backwards incompatible / breaking changes are quite frequent... I'd lean towards opting in to upgrades manually rather than automatically for now. Thx!

The wonderful thing about leveraging Dependabot, is it just opens a PR. (It *can* automatically merge also, if you want, but it is optional.) The PR makes it easy for CI to execute tests, plus raises awareness that changes have occurred in the project's dependencies.

Created a PR to bump up the version.

Also had a look at printing the Terraform version. Right now I see no "clean" way of achieving this as urfave is taking care of handling the `--version` flag.

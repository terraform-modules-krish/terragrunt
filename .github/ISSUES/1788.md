# Terragrunt not checking if source URL has a module correctly

**brikis98** commented *Aug 26, 2021*

It seems that Terragrunt doesn't properly show an error if you set the `source` URL to a folder path that doesn't actually exist.

For example, let's say you set `source = "github.com/foo/bar//modules/invalid-path"`, where `invalid-path` doesn't actually exist. As soon as you run `apply` or `init`, Terragrunt _should_ show an error. However, it seems to continue running silently, and you get more confusing errors later on. For example, one user had some `.tf` files in their local path, so those got copied to `invalid-path` in the Terragrunt cache, so Terragrunt treated it as if a module was there, but all the resources had been deleted.

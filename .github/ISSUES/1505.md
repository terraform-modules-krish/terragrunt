# Upgrade internal terraform to 0.13 or 0.14

**rhoboat** commented *Jan 21, 2021*

As a user pointed out, newer Terraform built-in functions like [`sum`](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/24666) are not supported in Terragrunt at the moment. We currently pull `terraform v0.12.24`. Can we update this to a newer version?

Any interest in enabling dependabot or renovatebot to automatically get PRs to update those dependencies? Might be easier to keep up than relying on users occasionally opening issues...

I spent some time looking into this. There are a bunch of different libraries that got moved within k8s.io/api and so forth. It will be a bit of a yak shave to get the appropriate versions of indirectly dependent packages.

Another update: So, we think the main issue comes from the fact that go modules support in kubernetes is a bit shoddy right now and we might have to hack it to avoid go modules pulling in the wrong versions. It will just take some focus time to iron out.

I wonder if renovatebot/dependabot would help here. We'd still have to correct the indirect dependency issues.

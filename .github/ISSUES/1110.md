# Error finding AWS credentials in file '~/.aws/credentials' (did you set the correct file name and/or profile?): NoCredentialProviders: no valid providers in chain.

Hey, 
Trying to work with terragrunt, but there is an error which I saw a lot of comments about it but neither of the solutions worked for me.
Can someone please assist? 
I have checked the profile name and it's ok. 
When running aws cli command with the same profile it works.
What else can I check? 



```
Encountered the following errors:
Error finding AWS credentials in file '~/.aws/credentials' (did you set the correct file name and/or profile?): NoCredentialProviders: no valid providers in chain. Deprecated.
        For verbose messaging see aws.Config.CredentialsChainVerboseErrors
```

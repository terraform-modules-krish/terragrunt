# Terragrunt asks to create backend if credentials expired

**alkalinecoffee** commented *May 24, 2019*

When using an AWS profile and the credentials have expired, terragrunt does not notify the user that their credentials have expired.  Instead, it suggests that the backend does not exist or is inaccessible, and asks the user if it should be created, which can be misleading.

For example, when running `terragrunt apply` with expired credentials:

```
$ terragrunt plan
...
Remote state S3 bucket tf-state does not exist or you don't have permissions
to access it. Would you like Terragrunt to create it? (y/n)
^C
```

Compared to terraform in the same scenario, which gives more helpful information:

```
$ terraform plan
Failed to load backend:
Error configuring the backend "s3": ExpiredToken: The security token included
in the request is expired
	status code: 403, request id: xxx
```

Good point. We should show the underlying error to make that clearer. PR very welcome!

# Unable to determine underlying exit code

**sitilge** commented *Sep 19, 2020*

I am running:

- alpine:latest container, 5.8.9-arch kernel
- terraform 0.13.3
- terragrunt 0.25.0

I am getting the following error, when running a shared GitLab worker:
```
$ terragrunt plan --terragrunt-working-dir asg
[terragrunt] [asg] 2020/09/19 18:40:47 Running command: terraform --version
[terragrunt] 2020/09/19 18:40:47 fork/exec /usr/local/bin/terraform: exec format error
[terragrunt] 2020/09/19 18:40:47 Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1
```

Not sure I follow... What Terragrunt command are you running? `terragrunt --version`?

Hi @sitilge, I am sorry you are having issues!

Personally, I am sadly unable to reproduce this when running `terragrunt --version` as per:

![Screenshot 2020-09-21 at 00 52 30](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/250723/93724137-d087f200-fba4-11ea-8cad-cffa6fcbfd0d.png)

There is nothing special about `--version` command-line switch.

How was your Terragrunt binary installed?

Same here... I can't repro this:

```
$ terragrunt --version
terragrunt version v0.25.0
```

I updated with the exact output.

@kwilczynski  in a Dockerfile, I am downloading the latest binary from Hashicorp site:

```
 #A one-liner to get the latest Terraform binary
RUN URL="https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/$(curl -s https://checkpoint-api.hashicorp.com/v1/check/terraform | jq -r -M '.current_version')/terraform_$(curl -s https://checkpoint-api.hashicorp.com/v1/check/terraform | jq -r -M '.current_version')_linux_amd64.zip" \
 && curl -o terraform.zip -L $URL \
 && unzip terraform.zip \
 && chmod +x terraform
```

Hi @sitilge, thank you for updating the initial log to include the error you are seeing.

Just to clarify - this is not really related to Terragrunt or running `terragrunt --version`. Your updated message clarified that.

Now, the crucial bit of information from the error output is the following:

```
[terragrunt] 2020/09/19 18:40:47 fork/exec /usr/local/bin/terraform: exec format error
```

Terragrunt runs Terraform as part of the `terragrunt plan`, but the Terraform binary at `/usr/local/bin/terraform` causes a failure that then bubbles up to Terragrunt as it can be run on the underlying platform. Commonly, such message can be seen if one of the following happens:

- Binary is for _wrong platform_ e.g., **x86** vs **ARM** (Linux vs Darwin)
- Binary is for _wrong architecture_ e.g., **x86** vs **x86_64** (32 bit vs 64 bit)
- Binary is a dynamic binary and loader/linker (ld) is _unable to resolve symbols_ this binary requires from libraries it was linked with (e.g., libraries are missing or incompatible version is installed, wrong rpath, etc.) i.e., Go binary build with `CGO_ENABLED` set to `1` and libc is at different location than what the rpath would suggest

Make sure that the platform and the architecture match that of the Terraform binary you are downloading.

Yes, the platform is using x86_64 GNU/Linux, which matches the binary I was getting.

I rebuilt the parent image:

```
Step 11/12 : RUN terraform --version
 ---> Running in 73ac265c02ec
Terraform v0.13.3
Removing intermediate container 73ac265c02ec
 ---> 5b5f98071bad
Step 12/12 : RUN terragrunt --version
 ---> Running in 6278b3aca33f
terragrunt version v0.25.1
```

and it works now... I don't know really what it was, but it works with terragrunt 0.25.1.

Thanks for digging into these! Looks like this was a Terraform binary issue that's now solved, so closing.

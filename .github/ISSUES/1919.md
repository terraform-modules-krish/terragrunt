# Add TerraformPath in dependency block to get output from different tfstate version

**leonardobiffi** commented *Nov 18, 2021*

When using the dependency on a resource that was created with a different terraform version, the error occurs when executing the `terraform output` command

```
Failed to load state: state snapshot was created by Terraform v1.0.6, which is newer than current v0.13.3; upgrade to Terraform v1.0.6 or greater to work with this state
```

The idea is to add an attribute to configure the terraform binary to be used for that dependency, like the example below

```
dependency "key_pair" {
  config_path       = "../test-keypair"
  terraform_path    = "/usr/local/bin/terraform/1.0.6/terraform"
  
  mock_outputs = {
    key_pair_name = "KEY"
  }
  mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands = ["validate", "plan"]
}
```

So when executing the `terraform output` command the terragrunt will use the binary configured in the dependency

# S3 State bucket - put public access block denied

**gpdenny** commented *Aug 19, 2022*

We are using a combination of account level S3 public access block, and an organization SCP that prevents the use of `PutBucketPublicAccessBlock`. 

This results in a (non-blocking, but mildly irritating) access denied error when creating new state buckets, and always having to skip bucket update for public access blocking when re-initialising a module to prevent access denied errors.

I believe we can use `disable_bucket_update` for the second case, but for the first it seems like Terragrunt will always try to enable public access block on new buckets.

Is there a possibility of introducing a skip for public access blocking, similar to other bucket configurations?

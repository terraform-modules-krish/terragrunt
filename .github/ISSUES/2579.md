# Query parsed HCL model

**denis256** commented *May 29, 2023*

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Exists cases when is required to get data from parsed HCL content, like:
* get dependencies that read terragrunt config from specific file (`read_terragrunt_config`)
* get dependencies that use to decrypt specific file file (`sops_decrypt_file`)


**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Tried to use `render-json` but it is generating "final" version of configuration with all included dependencies and parsed content.

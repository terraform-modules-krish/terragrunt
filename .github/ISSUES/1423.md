# terragrunt always re-runs `terraform init` with terraform 0.14.0-rc1

**ksvladimir** commented *Nov 13, 2020*

It seems terragrunt fails to detect when initialization is not necessary when using terraform 0.14.0-rc1. It always runs `terraform init` no matter what, and it takes a lot of time especially when dependencies are involved.

I also tried `terragrunt apply --terragrunt-no-auto-init`, and here's what happens:

```
$ terragrunt apply --terragrunt-no-auto-init
...
[terragrunt] 2020/11/13 01:29:18 Cannot continue because init is needed, but Auto-Init is disabled.  You must run 'terragrunt init' manually.
[terragrunt] 2020/11/13 01:29:18 Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1
```

This is the problem: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/7f0920ab4b961984a8d1cb60af48a2bb00961ad9/cli/cli_app.go#L723

It seems that terraform renamed `.terraform/plugins` into `.terraform/providers`. So the check needs to be:
```go
        providersPath013 := util.JoinPath(terragruntOptions.DataDir(), "plugins")
	providersPath014 := util.JoinPath(terragruntOptions.DataDir(), "providers")
	return !(util.FileExists(providersPath013) || util.FileExists(providersPath014))
```

Thanks for reporting! Since 0.14.0 is not out yet, we have not yet tested or updated Terragrunt to work with it. We will do so once the final version is released.

Now that 0.14 is out I think this must be locked at

Facing the same issue

A temporary workaround for this issue is to create a empty folder `plugins` in 
`.terragrunt-cache/RANDOM_HASH/ANOTHER_RANDOM_HASH/.terraform/`
like
`mkdir .terragrunt-cache/X0em602TiSrcCnD8MSB9SfZ-Wiw/Dtif5ds3Xi5dZzANQWFL-b_aEkQ/.terraform/plugins`

Terragrunt stops reinit after created this empty folder.

A way to automate it is add an after hook.
```
terraform {
  after_hook "reinit_workaround" {
    commands = ["plan", "apply"]
    execute = ["ruby", "-rfileutils", "-e", "FileUtils.mkdir_p(\".terraform/plugins\")"]
  }
}
```

@johnlinvc thanks your workaround makes it a lot more usable was so slow before

Super thanks for the fix! Is it possible to get it released soon?

**brikis98** commented *Jan 6, 2021*

We're working on it in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1459. We were out on vacation the last couple weeks for the holidays, but will pick it up again later this week.

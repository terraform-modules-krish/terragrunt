# Object locking and cross-region replication for remote state S3 buckets

**bwhaley** commented *Dec 18, 2021*

The Terragrunt state bucket creation feature currently doesn't include support for the S3 [object locking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/s3/#CreateBucketInput) or [bucket replication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/s3/#S3.PutBucketReplication) features. We should add this for more flexible and configurable state bucket configuration needs.

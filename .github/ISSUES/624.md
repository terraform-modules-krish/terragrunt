# New region eu-north-1 broken in terragrunt

**alanmcg** commented *Dec 17, 2018*

When running "terragrunt init --upgrade" I would expect terragrunt to download the latest terraform / tf aws provider which I believe already supports eu-north-1 (stockholm region) however I get the following error:

```
Error initializing new backend: 
Error configuring the backend "s3": Not a valid region: eu-north-1

Please update the configuration in your Terraform files to fix this error
then run this command again.
```

Edit: The bucket is actually created however, running again shows the same error however

We probably need to bump the AWS Go SDK version using `dep`. Anyone up for a quick PR?

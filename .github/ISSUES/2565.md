# Dependencies of dependencies not being respected in run-all group ordering

**jlepere-everlaw** commented *May 15, 2023*

**Describe the bug**

When calculating group ordering for `run-all` commands, dependencies of dependencies are not respected. The error manifests (at least how I experience it) as an outdated [output cache](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/df9f8792c33920dece415c26edbd9e1415aca585/config/dependency.go#L137-L139).

**To Reproduce**
Consider the following module dependency graph.

![image](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/assets/51681265/a66fa3ec-c956-43f1-a9f1-a2f5034157bd)

When running a `terragrunt run-all` command against modules **A** and **C** (not **B**), **A** will **not** be processed before **C**. They'll be placed in the same group.

**Expected behavior**
Dependencies of dependencies should be respected in `run-all` group ordering. In the example above, **A** should be processed before **C**.

**Versions**
- Terragrunt version: v45.3
- Terraform version: v1.0.11
- Environment details (Ubuntu 20.04, Windows 10, etc.): Ubuntu 20.04

**Additional context**
It's probably worth considering whether targeting **A** and **C**, but not **B**, even makes sense since **B** is an explicit dependency of **C**. Internally within my organization we _might_ (edit: we were) be able rework some things to avoid this, but we have a fairly complex module graph. This seems like a reasonable bug nonetheless.

@jlepere-everlaw, are you using [dependencies](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#dependencies) block? If so, could you please provide a simple configuration to reproduce this behavior?

I'm using [dependency](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#dependency) blocks.

I drastically simplified the example relative to my organization's configuration, so I don't off-hand. Let me see if I can whip something up real quick.

Alright, @levkoburburas, I was able to reproduce this with the following.

```
# terragrunt-issue-2565-example/A/terragrunt.hcl
terraform {
  source = "./"
}

# terragrunt-issue-2565-example/B/terragrunt.hcl
terraform {
  source = "./"
}
dependency "A" {
  config_path = "../A"
}

# terragrunt-issue-2565-example/C/terragrunt.hcl
terraform {
  source = "./"
}
dependency "B" {
  config_path = "../B"
}

$ terragrunt run-all apply --terragrunt-working-dir terragrunt-issue-2565-example/ --terragrunt-strict-include --terragrunt-include-dir A --terragrunt-include-dir C
INFO[0000] The stack at terragrunt-issue-2565-example/ will be processed in the following order for command apply:
Group 1
- Module /home/jakelepere/everlaw/servers/terragrunt-issue-2565-example/A
- Module /home/jakelepere/everlaw/servers/terragrunt-issue-2565-example/C
```

**C** should be processed in a separate group after **A** because **C** implicitly depends on **A**.

@jlepere-everlaw, according to the documentation [`--terragrunt-strict-include`](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli-options/#terragrunt-strict-include)

> When passed in, only modules under the directories passed in with [–terragrunt-include-dir](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli-options/#terragrunt-include-dir) will be included. All dependencies of the included directories will be excluded if they are not in the included directories. If no [–terragrunt-include-dir](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli-options/#terragrunt-include-dir) flags are included, terragrunt will not include any modules during the execution of the commands.

If the directory **_B_** is not included, there is no implicit/explicit relationship between **_A_** and **_C_**, thus **_A_** and **_C_** can be run in the same group in parallel. In other words, `terragrunt` knows nothing about the directory **_B_** in order to make it an implicit dependency.

Hmm, okay. Thanks, @levkohimins. This still feels a little unexpected to me, but :shrug:. FWIW, my organization was able to get around this by reworking our processes (i.e we target **A** and then **C** in separate commands).

You are welcome, @jlepere-everlaw. Glad to hear that the issue has been resolved one way or another. In this case, I am closing the issue.

# terragrunt plan -out into current working dir?

**esn89** commented *Mar 22, 2021*

I am using Terragrunt 0.21.6 and I am trying to get it working with https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis

I would like to be able to output my plan file into the current working directory and not into a cache directory like so:
`.terragrunt-cache/U7G6F5F4V_9Kh2H/$planfilename.tfplan`

I would like to be able to specify a place to put the plan, and if I cannot, just any where that isn't in the `.terragrunt-cache` directory is fine.  I tried it with the `-out` and it doesn't seem to do what I want it to.

Any help would be appreciated.
<br />

What did you try and what did it do?

@brikis98 

What I tried to do is:

`terragrunt plan -out $(pwd)/test.tfplan`
And I get an output like:
```This plan was saved to: /my/desired/directory/test.tfplan

To perform exactly these actions, run the following command to apply:
    terraform apply "/my/desired/directory/test.tfplan"
 ```

It works and in my current directory I see a file named `test.tfplan`.

What happens is that the apply doesn't work:

`terragrunt apply $(pwd)/test.tfplan`  nor `terragrunt apply ./test.tfplan` nor `terragrunt apply /my/desired/directory/test.tfplan`.  Any of these three don't work.  I get an error which says:

```
Too many command line arguments. Configuration path expected.

Could you post the full `terragrunt apply <PLAN>` command you're running _and_ the full log output? Also, please turn the [log level up](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli-options/#terragrunt-log-level).

Sure:

The first way didn't quite work:

```
terragrunt apply test.tfplan --terragrunt-log-level=trace

I re-ran it with this:
`TERRAGRUNT_DEBUG=true TG_LOG=debug terragrunt apply test.tfplan`
And got a trace:

I hope this helps

Oh, looks like you're using `extra_arguments`. This may be a duplicate of #454 in that case. If you remove those, does the error go away? I understand those args are important, so you'd still need a fix for #454, but it would be helpful to understand if that's the issue here.

**esn89** commented *Mar 30, 2021*

@brikis98 

I can confirm with you that removing the `extra_arguments` block made it work.
***

**brikis98** commented *Mar 31, 2021*

Ah, OK, thanks for confirming. Then this is a duplicate of https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/454. I'll close in favor of that issue.

@brikis98 

No worries, thanks for looking in.  Has a fix been released for this?  Or perhaps in a newer version of Terragrunt?
***

**brikis98** commented *Apr 1, 2021*

No fix yet. As you can see #454 is still open. PRs are very welcome.

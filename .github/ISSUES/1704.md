# yamldecode cannot parse string started with "0b"

**andreykaipov** commented *Jun 7, 2021*

This was an issue with Terraform in https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23770.

It was fixed in https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/25273 by updating the `zclconf/go-cty-yaml` library from v1.0.1 to v1.0.2.

Here's the different behavior between Terraform and Terragrunt:

```console
❯ terraform console
> yamldecode("key: 0ba")
{
  "key" = "0ba"
}
> exit

❯ cat terragrunt.hcl
locals {
  test = yamldecode("key: 0ba")
}

❯ terragrunt version
Error: Error in function call

  on /tmp/test/terragrunt.hcl line 2, in locals:
   2:   test = yamldecode("key: 0ba")

Call to function "yamldecode" failed: cannot parse "0ba" as tag:yaml.org,2002:int.

ERRO[0000] Encountered error while evaluating locals.
ERRO[0000] /tmp/test/terragrunt.hcl:2,10-21: Error in function call; Call to function "yamldecode" failed: cannot parse "0ba" as tag:yaml.org,2002:int.
ERRO[0000] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1
```

Versions:

```console
❯ terragrunt --version
terragrunt version v0.29.4

❯ terraform --version
Terraform v0.15.4
on linux_amd64
```

# include block to load terrgrunt.hcl from remote zip

**sleungcy** commented *Feb 27, 2020*

is it possible in the include block to load the root terragrunt.hcl from a remote zip file like the module source parameter for Terraform module blocks?

I am looking into making all my application deployments decentralized, such that developers who are deploying a single application during development do not need to perform extra steps to download the repo holding all the terragrunt.hcl files.

This is an interesting idea and I can see this being useful for improving terragrunt support in a poly repo setup. `read_terragrunt_config`, `dependency`, and the upcoming `import` block would probably also benefit from having something like that.

With that said, I am not sure we would want to maintain this going forward since we recommend a monorepo setup for the canonical use of terragrunt. This largely depends on if there is a sane way to maintain this in the increasingly complex terragrunt parsing code.

If anyone is interested in implementing this, the next steps would be to propose a detailed RFC that includes:

- Use case
- Example repo structure and example code on how to use this new feature (including syntax of remote file reference)
- (if possible) Some design proposals on the implementation to indicate that there is a way to do this that isn't overly complex.

I've been able to achieve this polyrepo setup without additional features from terragrunt. 

1) Using the --terragrunt-source cli argument to download and extract root level terragrunt.hcl.
2) In my application terragrunt.hcl, use the fileset function to search for the terragrunt.hcl from .terragrunt-cache.
e.g.
```
terragrunt.hcl
include {
  path = fileset( ".terragrunt-cache", "**/root-terragrunt.hcl" )
}
```

The project stucture will look like:

App#1
- terragrunt.hcl
- .terragrunt.cache
    - root-terragrunt.hcl

App#2
- terragrunt.hcl
- .terragrunt.cache
    - root-terragrunt.hcl

The reason I am doing this, is that we have 100+ microservices, and different teams work on only a small subset of these Apps. If we go with monorepo approach, our devs will have to first download the monorepo, which has 100+ subdirectories containing all the apps, and then using include/exclude filters to deploy their app. For developer experience and CD workflows, I find that reversing the dependency makes it a lot more seamless. 

Perhaps my use case is quite different from the majority, as we are using terraform to deploy microservices rather than infrastructure.

Another workaround would be to make use of Terragrunt's `run_cmd` command, i.e.:
```hcl
include {
  path = run_cmd("sh", "-c", "curl -s https://PATH/TO/terragrunt.hcl -o ../terragrunt.hcl && echo ../terragrunt.hcl")
}
```

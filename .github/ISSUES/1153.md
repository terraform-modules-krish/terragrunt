# Error while applying local module with dependencies

**Ludonope** commented *Apr 25, 2020*

This error seems to have appeared out of nowhere, I'm fairly sure there was no modification to the modules.

I have a repository with several modules defined:
```
infra-modules/
    api_gateway/
    lambda/
```

I have instances of the lambda module, which are dependencies to the api_gateway one:
```hcl
# lambda_1/terragrunt.hcl

terraform {
  source = "git::git@.../infra-modules.git//lambda?ref=v0.4.7"
}

include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

inputs = {
  # those are good since I can deploy this module alone
}
```

```hcl
# api_gateway/terragrunt.hcl

terraform {
  source = "git::git@.../infra-modules.git//api_gateway?ref=v0.4.7"
}

include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

dependency "lambda_1" {
  config_path = "../lambda_1"
}

inputs = {
  # ...
  routes = {
    "lambda/1" = {
      invoke_arn = dependency.lambda_1.outputs.invoke_arn
    }
  }
}
```

I have made some changes to the api_gateway module sources, and deployed it with `--terragrunt-source ../../some/path/infra-modules/api_gateway`. I've been doing it for some times and it worked until now.

Now when doing the same command I get the following output:
```

[terragrunt] 2020/04/25 06:56:50 Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1
```

I obfuscated a little and simplified the output as much as possible to make it readable since there are quite a few lambda modules giving some similar output.

The interesting part is that making a new tag on the `infra-module` repository, pushing it, and using that new version in the `api_gateway` module (so without using `--terragrunt source`) makes it work, without changing anything to its implementation.

This bug occured after updating my system packages, even tho neither terragrunt or terraform was updated in the process, so it probably doesn't come from there.

I'm running OSX Catalina, `uname -a` gives the following output:
```

What version of Terragrunt?

See https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.23.9 for what might be the fix for the issue you're seeing.

I'm using terragrunt v0.23.10 with terraform v0.12.24. It seems pretty similar to the issue you linked, but I'm not sure if it's that.

This looks like it is the same issue. It should work if you used the following for the source:

```
--terragrunt-source ../../some/path/infra-modules//api_gateway
```

(note the double slash before `api_gateway`). You can check out https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1134#discussion_r407167726 for the description of what is going on and why you need `//` (ignore the suggestion about `--terragrunt-source-map` as that is not implemented yet).

Oooh okay, got it.

Thank you!

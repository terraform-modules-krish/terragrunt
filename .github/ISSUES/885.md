# execute script as a git repo

**dzirg44** commented *Oct 2, 2019*

Hey. I have a little bit "strange" question about `execute` stage, i want to use my own script like
```hcl
terraform {
    source = "git::git@github.com:users/mybash.git//app?ref=v0.0.1"
    extra_arguments "custom_vars" {
      commands = [
        "apply",
      ]

      arguments = [
        "-var-file=config.tfvars",
      ]

      env_vars = {
        URL  = "${run_cmd("myscript.sh", "params")}"
      }
    }
    after_hook "cleanup" {
      commands = [
        "apply",
      ]
      execute      = ["myscript.sh", "params"]
      run_on_error = true
    }
}
```
where `source` is a github repo with my own script. 
Is it possible or not to use it like this ?
As I can see terragrunt can download this repo, but i have no idea how i can use it in my code...
sorry for my bad English and if this question doesn't have any sense.
<br />

I don't think we support this right now since there is no way to get the path to the script.

With that said, here is a workaround. The working directory for the hooks is the directory where the `terragrunt.hcl` lives. So technically, you could have a script in your `PATH` that can take in the relative script path from the module directory as an arg, and execute that script after looking for it in the terragrunt cache.

But I think having a function like `get_terragrunt_working_directory` would be a nice addition, so you could do:

```
execute = ["${get_terragrunt_working_directory()}/myscript.sh"]
```

for my opinion it should be like
```hcl
terraform {
    extra_arguments "custom_vars" {
      env_vars = {
        URL  = "${run_cmd("${get_terragrunt_working_directory(helpers.script1)}/myscript.sh", "params")}"
        TTL  = "${run_cmd("${get_terragrunt_working_directory(helpers.myscript2)}/getttl", "params")}"
      }
    }
}
helpers {
  script1 = "git::git@github.com:users/mybash.git//app?ref=v0.0.1"
  myscript2 = "git::git@github.com:fixme/goutil.git//app?ref=v0.0.3"
}
```

# AWS SSO error SSOProviderInvalidToken: the SSO session has expired or is invalid

**yiskaneto** commented *Jun 13, 2023*

**Describe the bug**
After logging using aws sso I am able to run aws cli command, deploy terraform modules, however I receive errors related to an invalid session if I try to use Terragrunt

**To Reproduce**
1. Log in using aws sso: `aws sso login --profile <profile name>`
1. List your bucket: `aws s3 ls`
1. Run a plan on a given **Terraform** module
1. Try to run a plan with **Terragrunt** 

**Expected behavior**
Terragrunt commands should be able to run as the we are already authenticated.

**Update 1 (Preferred workaround for now)**

I was able to make it to work by configuring AWS SSO without a session name, so when running `aws configure sso` don't provide a name for the session when the  `SSO session name (Recommended):` input message is prompted, just hit enter, this will return:
```bash
WARNING: Configuring using legacy format (e.g. without an SSO session).
Consider re-running "configure sso" command and providing a session name.
```
**Note**: When providing the sso_start_url value make sure that it does **NOT** contain the `#` symbol at the end.

Continue with the configuration and now the Terragrunt commands should work

**Update 2** (Leaving here just for informational purposes but don't use this mehod)

I was able to determine that if the url on the `sso_start_url` value of the profile block on the `~/.aws.configure` file does NOT end with `#/` then,  the  `SSOProviderInvalidToken: the SSO session has expired or is invalid ` error appears when running Terragrunt commands. So configure aws sso as you would normally do assigning a name for the session and the profile but make sure that the urls end with `#/`. Ultimately the `~/.aws.configure` file should look like this

```bash
[profile <profile name>]
sso_session = <profile name>
sso_account_id = <account id>
sso_role_name = <role name>
region = <region>
output = <output>
sso_start_url = https://<url>/start#/
sso_region = <region>

[sso-session ska]
sso_start_url = https://<url>/start#/
sso_region = <region>
sso_registration_scopes =<sso_registration_scopes>

```

I can confirm that issue with:

* AWS provider: 5.4.0

Hi, 

Is there any ongoing activity resolve this issue? I have been planning to use this problematic approach in a corporate project.

Thank you for accelerate the resolution.

Cheers!

I have to add that I can only replicate the bug on my home network as I don't see the issue if I am in the office. So I wonder about root cause.

Workaround by @escanoru works for me. Thank you!

Same issue for me, the work around does not work.
 Terraform: 1.5.3

> Same issue for me, the work around does not work. Terraform: 1.5.3

I updated Terraform to 1.5.3 and Terragrunt to 0.48.1 and ran into an into the following issue:
```bash
Error loading SSO Token: Token for https://<URL>/start# does not exist
```

So I updated the workaround 1 steps (https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/2604#issuecomment-1588478178) and is working for me now.

This fixed my issue

**tsbatista** commented *Jul 28, 2023*

Unfortunately for many of us, using a single profile does not work, hence workaround 1 is flawed as it forces the user to have a nameless sso session.

What I found to be a usable workaround working with multiple accounts (you will loose the auto refresh) is to export the credentials using 
```
aws configure export-credentials --format env
```
and using those in the shell where you will then use terragrunt.

**rpgeddam** commented *Aug 1, 2023*

FWIW, this doesn't seem to be a terragrunt specific issue. I ran into this issue using just plain ol' terraform v1.5.3 and google brought me to this page. The workaround at the top of the thread works though.

**crotger** commented *Aug 23, 2023*

here's a slightly different workaround that is a little less effort:
```
[profile terraform]
credential_process = aws --profile terraform-sso configure export-credentials --format process
region = <region>
output = json

[profile terraform-sso]
sso_session = <session>
<... rest of SSO config>
```

Configure the `terraform-sso` profile with the SSO session name as usual using `aws configure sso`, then you can point the `terraform` profile to dump the creds from that one using credential_process, and use `AWS_PROFILE=terraform` for actually running terraform. You'll still have to log in with the terraform-sso profile, however.

This is the best approach thus far to workaround this when having multiple profiles.

Looks like terraform itself is going to start supporting the new format soon: https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32465#issuecomment-1713948699

Would be nice if this were fixed in time for that release.

**benjefferies** commented *Oct 9, 2023*

1.6.0 is released now. It would be good to fix this in terragrunt 🎉

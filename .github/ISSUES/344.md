# Allow S3 backend key to be defined in child

**mike-schiller** commented *Nov 2, 2017*

It seems very common to specify remote state in the root terraform.tfvars file.  In the context of the S3 backend this works well for the encryption, bucket, region, and lock table settings. However, specifying key = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate" assumes that I'm never going to change where a child is located in my directory structure.

It would be nice if the key could be set to a fixed value in the child's .tfvars file so that the structure of the state does not depend on the relative location of the child within the Terragrunt directory structure.

You can change the child directory, but you should move its remote state in that case too. If you store remote state in S3, that's just a matter of `aws s3 --recursive mv s3://<bucket>/<old-path> s3://<bucket>/<new-path>`. Keeping the path of the code in sync with the path of the state makes it much, much easier to figure out which state files belong to which code.

Moreover, you can override the `remote_state` block in any child, so if you really do need something custom, it's possible to do it. The one catch is that, IIRC, it overrides the *entire* `remote_state` configuration, so you'd have to copy/paste the other values... I suppose an improvement would be to merge the parent and child values together...

You raise a good point about moving the state in S3. Perhaps the better way to handle this would be to add a 'mv' command to Terragrunt that moves both the local folder and the remote storage location at the same time.

Ah, that's a good idea. I'd definitely welcome a PR for that.

# Nested maps/blocks in remote_state.config is not supported

**lawliet89** commented *Apr 5, 2019*

I am trying to use Terragrunt with TFE (free) [remote backend](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/remote.html).

Consider this `terraform.tfvars`:

```hcl
terragrunt {
  remote_state {
    backend = "remote"
    config {
      organization = "xxx"
      workspaces {
        name = "${path_relative_to_include()}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Terragrunt invokes Terraform init with 

```
terraform init -backend-config=organization=xxx -backend-config=workspaces=[map[name:workload_project]] -get=false -get-plugins=false -backend=false -from-module=file:///home/xxx/.terragrunt-cache/VeJiHFjPAEVHjBA0_pT08qczlFw/Jf8vct3Z9o5dLHa0HGyO6z_IBGg
```

The nested map is not converted correctly to command line argument.

I am using terragrunt version v0.18.3

Workaround:

```hcl
terragrunt {
    extra_arguments "remote_state" {
      commands = ["init"]
      arguments = [
        "-backend-config=organization=xxx",
        "-backend-config=workspaces=[{name = \"${path_relative_to_include()}\"}]"
      ]
    }
  }
}

```

EDIT: This workaround will not work for Terraform 0.12 at the moment. See https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/21830

Ah, yea, that's definitely a bug. We have not tested Terraform with any TFE features, as the paid TFE only ran `terraform` and not `terragrunt`, so most people used one or the other. With TFE free, I guess that equation changes a bit and we need to fix the argument formatting code. PR very welcome!

I got something like the mentioned workaround setup but then it complains with the following:
Error loading state: default state not supported
You can create a new workspace with the "workspace new" command.

Terraform 0.12 will prevent the implementation of this due to https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/21830

In hashicorp/terraform#21830, Martin mentioned that Terraform Enterprise/Cloud writes a temporary file to provide to Terraform. I suppose this can also be fixed by having Terragrunt write a temporary file for Terraform to use.

Oh, good find @lawliet89. That definitely makes things more complicated ðŸ˜•

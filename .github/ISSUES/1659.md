# Terragrunt log level not sufficient to log requests, and work out why access was denied

**gtmtech** commented *Apr 26, 2021*

I have an Access Denied problem when trying to run terragrunt. When I supply the maximum level of logs, no information is given about the request for which the Access is Denied:

It would be useful if log-level trace would actually dump the HTTP call, like happens in terraform when TF_LOG is set to TRACE, so you could see the call which results in the access being denied. As it is, it is pure guesswork to try and solve this problem. 

Note, TF_LOG=TRACE wont help here, because it has not yet invoked terraform (despite saying that it will) - confirmed by checking strace and the ps table.

```
terragrunt init --terragrunt-log-level trace --terragrunt-debug
```

```

In this case, the error turned out to be that terragrunt couldn't fetch the versioning status of the state bucket, but I had to wire up an SSL proxy, and add it's SSL cert to the ca-certificate store and intercept each SSL request to find that out. 

Ideally I shouldn't have to do that, and terragrunt should let me know at trace level what requests it was trying to make so I can diagnose more easily.

Terragrunt mostly uses the AWS Go SDK under the hood. Perhaps there's some way to enable trace logging for the AWS SDK when Terragrunt trace logging is enabled? Suggestions / PRs are very welcome.

I am having the same issue trying to find the root cause of an s3 that failed to be created and returned AccessDenied.

At this point, I do not how to debug the problem. The output is not useful to know the exact cause of why the s3 bucket cannot be created if I can do it manually via AWS CLI using the same profile. The permissions are OK if I can create it manually...

`ERRO[0035] Create S3 bucket with retry <bucket-name> returned an error: AccessDenied: Access Denied

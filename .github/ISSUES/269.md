# lock_table deprecated

**robinbowes** commented *Aug 24, 2017*

The terraform remote state configuration directive `lock_table` for the S3 backend  is deprecated in favour of the new directive `dynamodb_table`

terraform throws the following warning when initialising the backend:

```
Initializing the backend...
"lock_table": [DEPRECATED] please use the dynamodb_table attribute
```

I tried using `dynamodb_table` in the terragrunt remote config but it is not recognised.

Ah, good catch. Should be a straightforward fix. PRs very welcome!

I shall take a look. This could be my first go code...

Thank you!

did you get an error?  I switched to dynamodb_table and am getting no errors.
***

**robinbowes** commented *Aug 29, 2017*

No error, just the deprecation warning.

**grimm26** commented *Aug 30, 2017*

No, I mean you indicate that terragrunt did not recognize the dynamodb_table option.  Did you get an error for that?

I can't remember 100%, but I *think* it just got ignored.

I started a new Terragrunt/Terraform project and tried to use terragrunt init with dynamodb_table and Terragrunt didn't create a DynamoDB table automatically like it would if I had used lock_table.

Hmm, I switched mine to dynamodb_table and locking is still done.  Granted, I haven't tried making a new state file.

@grimm26 I expect the distinction here is between having a dynamodb table that already exists vs creating a new one.  If the lock table doesn't exist, vanilla terraform doesn't create it.  That's something terragrunt handles.

I haven't looked at the code directly, but I would assume that terragrunt passes the entire terragrunt.remote_state.config block to terraform init, rather than whitelisting specific variables, which explains why switching to dynamodb_table works just fine with an existing configuration.  On the other hand, since creating a new locktable is handled within terragrunt, this code path would have the lock_table key name hardcoded.

End result, it's entirely consistent that s/lock_table/dynamodb_table/ would work fine on existing infrastructure but cause an error when creating a new environment.

Fixed by #309.

I'm still getting this message in the log ""lock_table": [DEPRECATED] please use the dynamodb_table attribute"

Did you update your remote state config to use `dynamodb_table` instead of `lock_table`?

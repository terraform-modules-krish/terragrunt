# Update --terragrunt-modules-that-include flag to support working with read_terragrunt_config

**yorinasub17** commented *Nov 10, 2021*

We introduced `--terragrunt-modules-that-include` (https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1893) to get a list of all the modules that include a given terragrunt configuration, but it only works with `include` blocks. We should enhance it to also support generating the list of modules that reference via `read_terragrunt_config` to complete the picture.

As far as implementation goes, one suggestion is:

> I'm going to toss out an idea that may be dumb, but just in case: since we implement the read_terragrunt_config helper, could it maintain an internal cache (map) of (a) which files were read in and (b) which files were doing the reading? If so, could that cache be used to do the --terragrunt-modules-that-include style filtering?

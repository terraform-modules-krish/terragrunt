# validate-all requires credentials

**adborden** commented *Nov 1, 2018*

I'd like to run some simple lint-style checks on CI. When using terraform, I usually use `validate`, so for terragrunt `validate-all` seems like the correct choice. However, it fails, complaining that the credentials are not set.

I think part of the issue is that terragrunt does a backend initialize on every command. With terraform, you can run `terraform init -backend=false` which allows you to continue with the validate even without credentials. This doesn't work with terragrunt.

Is there any workarounds with this one @adborden? have run into this myself.

Is even possible to validate terraform somehow?  
because `terraform init -backend=false && terraform validate` will not work, cuz .tfvars will not be validated and .tf files will eventually not get variables in this case.

IMHO terragrunt should handle this.

EDIT:
Wondering if is possible to override remote backend like this?
```bash
cat << EOF >> ./terraform.tfvars
 terragrunt = {
   remote_state {
      backend = "local"
   }
}
EOF
terragrunt validate-all --terragrunt-config ./terraform.tfvars
```
but of course, there would be a problem with missing block
```
terraform {
  backend "local" {}
}
```
in each project
Fixable with:
```
`find ./ -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i 's/backend "azurerm" {}/backend "local" {}/g'`
```
, but its not good :x

@adborden mind checking out #761? I think we can close this one off.

You should be able to use something like the following and set the environment variable during your CI process.

```
remote_state {
  disable_init = tobool(get_env("DISABLE_INIT", "false"))
}
```

sadly `disable_init` does not work for dependencies https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/2603 (workaround included)

# only one levels of includes?

**dmead** commented *Aug 21, 2020*

why is this limit imposed? seems pretty arbitrary. 

```...terragrunt.hcl, which itself includes ... terragrunt.hcl. Only one level of includes is allowed.```

Will be closing as duplicate of https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/303.

The [imports RFC](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/v0.23.33/_docs/rfc/imports.md) covers the solution we intend for this, as well as some of the reasoning why we avoided it (also covered in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/303#issuecomment-372074758).

# Documentation: Generate blocks support the argument `name`

**matt-land** commented *Jan 27, 2022*

The docs say this argument "name" is available for "generator"

>The generate block supports the following arguments:

>>name (label): You can define multiple generate blocks in a single terragrunt config.

https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#generate

The argument isn't in the source code:

https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/codegen/generate.go#L49-L56

The argument doesn't work:

> Unsupported argument; An argument named "name" is not expected here.


Is this a legacy argument that left, or a new argument that is coming?

The `(label)` is meant to indicate that this is a label argument, and not an attribute argument. Labels in HCL are the strings that are passed next to the block in the declaration. So you set the name as so:

```hcl
generate "name" {
}
```

instead of like a normal argument.

# Need some way to specify where extra arguments are placed

**chrisportela** commented *Mar 28, 2018*

For instance I add the following to all my terraform states

```
{
  terraform {
    extra_arguments "ouput_plan" {
      commands = [
        "plan"
      ]

      # With the get_tfvars_dir() function, you can use relative paths!
      arguments = [
        "-out=${get_tfvars_dir()}/tfplan.out"
      ]
    }

    extra_arguments "apply_plan" {
      commands = [
        "apply",
        "destroy"
      ]

      # With the get_tfvars_dir() function, you can use relative paths!
      arguments = [
        "${get_tfvars_dir()}/tfplan.out"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

However when I run `apply-all` I get the following:
```
[snip]
[terragrunt] [/Users/cp/projects/work/infrastructure/src/aws/global] 2018/03/28 15:02:36 Running command: terraform apply /Users/cp/projects/work/infrastructure/src/aws/global/tfplan.out -input=false -auto-approve
Too many command line arguments. Configuration path expected.
[snip]
```

I run in to a lot of issues like being able to pass `-terragrunt-source` or `-terragrunt-source-update` flags (I need to use env) because the extra arguments are placed before any extra arguments given. I can see why that is since the feature is for **flags**, but I think this is still a valuable feature to have built in to terragrunt. 

As far as the feature being "need way to...": I'm not sure that's the best solution either, but maybe some field called `arguments_post` or `pre_arguments` would solve this in a way that is clear to others.

Looks like this method is not behaving as intended: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/options/options.go#L177. PRs with a fix are welcome.

I also came across this issue when trying to implement a plan-all command which persists a planfile, that is used by apply-all later.
This would work perfectly fine if terragrunt wouldn't try to add `-input=false -auto-approve` at the end of the cmd.

Too many command line arguments. Configuration path expected.

these parameters should have to be ordered before the specific planfile. Resulting in the following cmd which would work when running manually

> terraform  apply -input=false -auto-approve <path-to-plan-file>/tfplan.out

Is there any way around this?  We implemented extra arguments in tfvars as described in #428 to save multiple plans as part of CI, but are now seeing the same thing.

+1, just came across this. Will try to find some time to look into what's causing the error and fix. @brikis98

I had the same issue and I found a workaround/possible fix.

Why do we need `-input=false -auto-approve` by default?

I removed them from configstack/stack.go
```
// Apply all the modules in the given stack, making sure to apply the dependencies of each module in the stack in the
// proper order.
func (stack *Stack) Apply(terragruntOptions *options.TerragruntOptions) error {

	// stack.setTerraformCommand([]string{"apply", "-input=false", "-auto-approve"})

	stack.setTerraformCommand([]string{"apply"})
	return RunModules(stack.Modules)
}
```
Added those arguments to my terragrunt configuration (only if you require them):

```
  terraform {
    extra_arguments "plan_vars" {
      commands = [
        "plan",
      ]

      arguments = [
        "-out",
        "${get_tfvars_dir()}/plan.tfplan",
      ]
    }

    extra_arguments "apply_vars" {
      commands = [
        "apply",
      ]

      arguments = [
        "-auto-approve",
        "-input=false",
        "${get_tfvars_dir()}/plan.tfplan",
      ]
    }
  }
``` 

And the command is now valid and applies the plan:

`Running command: terraform apply -auto-approve -input=false plan.tfplan`

@carlosfrancia just wondering if you have submit a PR with your fix?

**zot24** commented *Aug 31, 2019*

jtlyk I have created this PR https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/848 and instead of removing those options as @carlosfrancia mentioned I re organize them on the execution as @seppi91 and @brikis98 mentioned above and that solved my use case plz feedback :)

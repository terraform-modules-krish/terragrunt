# Terragrunt in Centos

**muthurajr** commented *Oct 15, 2018*

I'm trying to execute terragrunt in a Centos container to bring AWS stack which is built from below snippet.

```
FROM centos:latest
RUN yum install -y curl unzip
RUN curl -O https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.11.8/terraform_0.11.8_linux_amd64.zip \
    && unzip terraform_0.11.8_linux_amd64.zip \
    && mv terraform /usr/bin/terraform
RUN curl -O https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/download/v0.17.0/terragrunt_linux_amd64 \
    && mv terragrunt_linux_amd64 /usr/local/bin/terragrunt \
    && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/terragrunt
```

Output
```
[root@7f7055edd444 governor]# terragrunt plan
/usr/local/bin/terragrunt: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `<'

```
The problem doesn't seem to be with terragrunt as it works if we consider linuxbrew based install and some explicit package is missing.

Do we need to install any specific package in Centos to proceed?

In your case `curl -O` downloads the HTML page of HTTPS permanent redirect. Change your `curl -O` command to `wget` in the Docker image file and your are good to go, but be sure you install `wget` with `yum` before that.

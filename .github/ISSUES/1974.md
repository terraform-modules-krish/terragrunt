# Dependency errors should be masked

**leiarenee** commented *Jan 11, 2022*

Dependency errors over complicate the output making it difficult to find real error. Dependency errors should be masked in the output focusing on the real error. The dependency errors which are caused just because dependency module did not complete are not helping but creating a lot of noise in the stderr.

`
 * Cannot process module Module ../temp-job/00000/shared/module-aws-lb-listener (excluded: false, assume applied: false, dependencies: ../temp-job/00000/shared/module-aws]) because one of its dependencies ....
`

These dependency errors accumulate onto each other ending up several pages of error and it is useless.

# bundled tflint fails 

**abillingsley** commented *Jul 15, 2023*

**Describe the bug**
I've configured a before_hook consistent with the tflint hook documentation but when attempting to run lint the tflint command fails with the following error.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior, code snippets and examples which can be used to reproduce the issue.

```hcl
terraform {
  before_hook "before_hook" {
    commands = ["validate"]
    execute  = ["tflint"]
  }
}
```

```
terragrunt run-all validate --terragrunt-working-dir live/dev
```

**Expected behavior**
tflint to execute without issue

**Nice to have**
```
Installing `aws` plugin...
Installed `aws` (source: github.com/terraform-linters/tflint-ruleset-aws, version: 0.24.1)
Failed to initialize plugins; Unrecognized remote plugin message: Incorrect Usage. flag provided but not defined: -act-as-bundled-plugin
This usually means
  the plugin was not compiled for this architecture,
  the plugin is missing dynamic-link libraries necessary to run,
  the plugin is not executable by this process due to file permissions, or
  the plugin failed to negotiate the initial go-plugin protocol handshake

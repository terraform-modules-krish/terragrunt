# Rename the gostructToCty function in config_as_cty.go

**infraredgirl** commented *Oct 8, 2020*

As per [this comment](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1232/files#r444288437) the [`gostructToCty`](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/config/config_as_cty.go#L184) function has a misleading name, because it works not only for structs but also for other data types, such as arrays. It should be renamed to better reflect its true use.

# import with extra arguments fails due to argument order

**bdashrad** commented *Feb 21, 2017*

Using the following config, import does not work as expected, due to resulting argument order:

```
terragrunt= {
  terraform = {
    {
      extra_arguments "secrets" {
        arguments = [
          "-var-file=terraform.tfvars",
          "-var-file=terraform-secret.tfvars"
        ]
        commands = [
          "apply",
          "plan",
          "import",
          "push",
          "refresh"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
```

```

The import command expects two arguments.
Usage: terraform import [options] ADDR ID
```

The extra arguments (options) need to be passed between `terraform import` and the resources to import, like this:

```
$ terraform import -var-file=terraform.tfvars -var-file=staging.tfvars module.legacy.aws_elb.elb staging-balancer
module.legacy.aws_elb.elb: Importing from ID "staging-balancer"...
module.legacy.aws_elb.elb: Import complete!
  Imported aws_elb (ID: staging-balancer)
module.legacy.aws_elb.elb: Refreshing state... (ID: staging-balancer)

Import success! The resources imported are shown above. These are
now in your Terraform state. Import does not currently generate
configuration, so you must do this next. If you do not create configuration
for the above resources, then the next `terraform plan` will mark
them for destruction.
```

Ah, good catch. I suspect there are probably other commands that have a similar issue. PRs to fix this are very welcome!

Should be fixed by #205.

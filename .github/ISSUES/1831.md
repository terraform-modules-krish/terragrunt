# Official docker image request 

**smitthakkar96** commented *Sep 28, 2021*

Currently people have to rely on https://hub.docker.com/r/alpine/terragrunt for using terragrunt in docker if they don't want the hassle of building their own images. It looks like Terragrunt maintainers have been releasing patches quite frequently and new patches aren't available immediately to docker users as the alpine CircleCI job runs nightly and occasionally fails. It would be great if gruntworks takes care of rolling out docker images when releasing new version of Terragrunt.

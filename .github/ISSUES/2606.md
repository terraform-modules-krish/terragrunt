More importantly,   how can we utilize the new "import existing resources" configuration
https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-1-5-brings-config-driven-import-and-checks#config-driven-import

This is super promising. but how can we utilize it through terragrunt and current hcl files?

On a second thought, probably for "import existing resources"  specifically the modules them self should take possible references as an input and do the "import". internally...    it is probably not something to do on terragrunt level

current work around for this is using `generate`

```bash
└── example-role
    ├── import.hcl
    └── terragrunt.hcl
```

import.hcl
```hcl
generate "import" {
  path      = "import.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  contents  = <<EOF

import {
    id = "example-role"
    to = aws_iam_role.this
}

EOF
}

```

terragrunt.hcl
```hcl
terraform {
  source = "git::ssh://git@github.com/EXAMPLE/infrastructure-modules.git//security/iam-role?ref=v1337
}

include "root" {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

include "import" {
  path = "import.hcl"
}

inputs = {
  name = "example-role"
}
```

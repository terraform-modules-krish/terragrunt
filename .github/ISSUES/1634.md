# GCP: not all authentication ways supported

**awasilyev** commented *Apr 7, 2021*

Currently terragrunt support only direct setting path to the json with gcp credentials or using GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS.

It will be really useful to support other methods, like authentication as end user (via gcloud auth login) or specifying key file system wide (via gcloud auth  activate-service-account  )

How do those other methods work?

Note: we probably won't be able to get to this ourselves any time soon, so if someone has time to think through how this would work and submit a PR, that would be the best bet here.

terragrunt (like terraform) seems to support `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` and `gcloud auth application-default login`, the latter follow the same process as `gcloud auth login` but it actually creates a .json file called `application_default_credentials.json`. Doing this `gcloud auth activate-service-account` in my books is the same as `export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` as in both cases you have to provide a key-file for the service account.

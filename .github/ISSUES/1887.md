# ZSH outputting error when using get_env during destroy

**stephenliberty** commented *Oct 25, 2021*

Hi - so, I'm not really familiar with zsh, but I confirmed that this was happening with a zsh shell user and wasn't happening to a bash shell user. 

Anyway, I have a block:

```hcl

locals {
  gitlab_address   = "https://<snip>/api/v4/projects/${get_env("GITLAB_PROJECT_ID")}/terraform/state/${replace(path_relative_to_include(), "/", "_")}"
}

```

There is a variable set in my environment for GITLAB_PROJECT_ID. However, I get the following error when I try to run a destroy: 

> Call to function "get_env" failed: EnvVarNotFound: Required environment variable GITLAB_PROJECT_ID - not found.

The error seems to be a red herring. It doesn't actually exit the program and it does seem to update the state appropriately. 

I'm not sure what other information to provide that would be useful. I don't think that this zsh profile is doing anything "odd". Apply seems to work without issue, as does plan.

This error occurs during the parsing stage where terragrunt tries to find all the dependent files. I've seen this happen in my runs as well, where it reports parsing errors when it succeeds to run destroy. I'm not sure why the env var doesn't propagate though.

@denis256 can you look into this one? I think at a minimum, we should figure out how to suppress the parsing errors as debug level (since showing them is confusing) and only log the warning for that stage.

Yes, will look into

After PR https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1889 I don't see the issue to appear

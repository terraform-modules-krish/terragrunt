# terragrunt-use-partial-parse-config-cache breaks dependency outputs in some cases

**jclangst** commented *Aug 30, 2023*

**Describe the bug**
 `--terragrunt-use-partial-parse-config-cache` results in outputs not being found in state files.


**To Reproduce**

Example terragrunt module where this fails unexpectedly [here](https://github.com/Panfactum/panfactum/blob/main/environments/development/us-east-2/kube_ingress_controllers/terragrunt.hcl).

Starting with no `.terragrunt-cache`.

Run `terragrunt apply --input=false -auto-approve -compact-warnings --terragrunt-non-interactive --terragrunt-include-external-dependencies --terragrunt-fetch-dependency-output-from-state --terragrunt-use-partial-parse-config-cache`

Results in

```
time=2023-08-30T17:16:58Z level=error msg=/home/runner/_work/panfactum/panfactum/environments/development/us-east-2/panfactum_primary_api_deployment/terragrunt.hcl:51,47-55: Unsupported attribute; This object does not have an attribute named "nat_ips"
```

The statefile does have that output. Simply removing `--terragrunt-use-partial-parse-config-cache` allows command to execute successfully as expected.

**Expected behavior**
The command should have the same behavior regardless of the presence of  `--terragrunt-use-partial-parse-config-cache` .

**Versions**
- Terragrunt version: `v0.48.6`
- Terraform version: `v1.3.7`
- Environment details (Ubuntu 20.04, Windows 10, etc.): `linux_amd64` 

**Additional context**
My best guess is that the import structure of my project results in the wrong state file being pulled. A bit weird since I structured it mostly similar to the [example repo](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example).

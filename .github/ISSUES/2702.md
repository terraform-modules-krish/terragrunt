# Improve caching for parsing configuration

**tomaciazek** commented *Sep 6, 2023*

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Implement config parsing cache also around `ParseConfigString`. Currently caching is implemented only for partial config parsing (`PartialParseConfigString`).

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Maybe it would be possible to reduce the number calls to parse config by other means. For instance, by disabling somehow the call of `setIAMRole`, which currently doubles the amount of times each file is re-parsed for files referenced by `read_terragrunt_config` in inlcuded files (through `include` block).

**Additional context**
The setup in which this is most visible is when a file included using the `include` block reads another file using the `read_terragrunt_config` function. This results in re-parsing the file 14 times, even with `--terragrunt-use-partial-parse-config-cache` set. Commenting out the call to `setIAMRole` function in the `config.go` file reduces this amount to 8. I also noticed that removing `expose = true` cuts the number of parses by half too. Also, just having one or more references to the exposed variable increases the number of parses.

For larger projects, where also the `dependency` block is used, this quickly adds up to a long execution time. For instance, if we have modules A, B, C, and module A has dependency on both B and C, while module B also has dependency on C, the configuration file referenced by module C in setup as described above is read 23 times (instead of 14), provided that only module C includes that file.

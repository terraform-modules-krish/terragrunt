# interleaving in `output-all -json` results in malformed JSON output

**mrtyler** commented *Mar 30, 2018*

I've been having intermittent failures in my CI pipeline, wherein `terragrunt output-all -json` produces invalid JSON.

I'm using terragrunt 0.14.0 and terraform 0.11.3. Both are a little out-of-date but I don't see anything in the release notes for either project discussing this type of problem.

This is the normal result of `output-all` in a directory containing two simple terraform modules for AWS resources, one for a Route 53 zone, the other for some EBS volumes:

```
{
  "cluster_dns_zone_id": {
    "sensitive": false,
    "type": "string",
    "value": "Z3VJB5SSD3OAIA"
  },
  "couchdb_us-east-2a_volume_id": {
    "sensitive": false,
    "type": "string",
    "value": "vol-0ff1954f00be78317"
  },
  "couchdb_us-east-2b_volume_id": {
    "sensitive": false,
    "type": "string",
    "value": "vol-086760a15bb8721b9"
  },
  "couchdb_us-east-2c_volume_id": {
    "sensitive": false,
    "type": "string",
    "value": "vol-061504ced17c2063a"
  },
  "prometheus_us-east-2b_volume_id": {
    "sensitive": false,
    "type": "string",
    "value": "vol-00f0b7af4b1f5b2ad"
  },
  "prometheus_us-east-2c_volume_id": {
    "sensitive": false,
    "type": "string",
    "value": "vol-0c3f62cf34df57f00"
  }
}
```

Yet, about 5% of the time, the output looks something like this instead:

```
{
    "couchdb_us-east-2a_volume_id": {
        "sensitive": false,
        "type": "string",
        "value": "vol-0ff1954f00be78317"
    },
    "couchdb_us-east-2b_volume_id": {
        "sensitive": false,
{
        "type": "string",
    "cluster_dns_zone_id": {
        "value": "vol-086760a15bb8721b9"
        "sensitive": false,
    },
        "type": "string",
    "couchdb_us-east-2c_volume_id": {
        "value": "Z3VJB5SSD3OAIA"
    }
        "sensitive": false,
}
        "type": "string",
        "value": "vol-061504ced17c2063a"
    },
    "prometheus_us-east-2b_volume_id": {
```

I'm able to reproduce the problem (~5% of the time, i.e. after ~20 iterations) with this dumb one-liner:

```
count=1 ; rc=0 ; while [ "$rc" == "0" ] ; do output=$(cd ../prereqs/stg/ && TMPDIR=/tmp/tyler/rake-tmp/stg-prereqs/ terragrunt output-all --terragrunt-non-interactive -json --terragrunt-ignore-dependency-errors | tee tee.json | jq -s add) ; rc=$? ; echo "FINISHED - COUNT = $count RC = $rc OUTPUT = $output" ; count=$((count + 1)) ; done
```

Kinda ugly but I wanted to include the whole thing in case I'm doing something that is causing shell IO to freak out and trigger this problem. (The real problem happens in a slightly more complex environment, where terragrunt is invoked in ruby code via backticks.)

I realize this is a tricky type of problem to pin down and I haven't drilled down to a minimum repro case, but I thought I'd start with a bug report :).

I think this is pretty straight forward actually: Terragrunt does not make any guarantees about the order of the output for `xxx-all` commands. It runs `terraform output` in parallel across all your modules, so the output will definitely end up interweaving from time to time. Doing things in parallel makes perfect sense for `apply-all`, but perhaps not for other commands.

There are a few options:

1. Save log output from `xxx-all` commands to file (#74).
1. Reformat the output so you get all the output for one module at a time (#78, ish). The downside is that you wouldn't see the output from modules that complete early for a long time.
1. Run `output-all` and perhaps `plan-all` serially, rather than in parallel.

Thanks for the explanation, Yevgeniy.

It definitely violates my expectations to say "`output-all -json` may return something that is not valid JSON" :).

I think your proposed solutions are all reasonable. 3 seems the simplest, but may be slow in practice for users with a lot of modules. 1 feels a little clunky; instead of `terragrunt output-all | whatever` I have to go hunting for log files, though the file-based approached has other advantages as noted in #74.

For my use case, 2 looks best and the downside doesn't hurt much because I'm sending all the output to something that processes JSON anyway.

FWIW I'm working around this problem by re-trying when the result of `output-all` is invalid. I don't know how well this approach will scale, but it works for me for now.

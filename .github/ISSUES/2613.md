# Sourcing existing Hashicorp azurerm provider modules in Terragrunt

**u6643** commented *Jun 19, 2023*

Hello,

I am working on Azure using **Terraform 1.4.5** and **Terragrunt 0.45.3**.

Hashicorp's official **azurerm** provider has various resource types which are fine for me "out-of-the-box" with respect to modularization, parameters, etc.

For example Key Vault:
https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/key_vault

As a source module is referenced within terragrunt.hcl with a 
```
terraform {
  source = "........" 
}
```
block, I wonder if a resource-type/module out of the official azurerm provider can be sourced directly in Terragrunt?
i.e. I want to **avoid writing** a dedicated **thin Terraform module wrapper** around the official azurerm provider (with no extra value), just to be able to call it in Terragrunt to deploy e.g. a Key Vault.

The Terraform documentation talks about **Modules in Package Sub-directories**: 
https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/sources#modules-in-package-sub-directories

Example: 
hashicorp/consul/aws//modules/consul-cluster

However, I couldn't find any suitable documentation whether this works with azurerm too, and how the sub-directory layout looks like.
In addition, looking within the .terraform folder after a `terraform init` also doesn't show me any sub-directory layout.

Well, maybe you have stumbled across the very same issue with Terragrunt and can point me into the right direction?

Thanks a lot for any help!
<br />

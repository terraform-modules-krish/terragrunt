Integration tests seem to be failing for terragrunt master branch. This issue is to hold the work to investigate why they're failing and add fixes for that.

Integration tests failed because of AWS account reached limit on number of S3 buckets, cleanup of test buckets wasn't working because of `cloud-nuke` execution errors, after  fixing [execution in](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/pull/384), integration tests started to pass

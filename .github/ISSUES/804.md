# terragrunt hclfmt: support for `-check` mode

**gtirloni** commented *Jul 30, 2019*

Currently `terragrunt hclfmt` will recursively modify files. This is very nice but it doesn't work well in CI pipelines to test if code is properly formatted.

Please consider implementing a `-check` option (or similar) like the one in `terraform fmt -check`.

That's a good idea. A PR to add this functionality would be very welcome. The idea would be to expose a CLI arg that propagates down to this function (https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/cli/hclfmt.go#L42), which is then used to toggle between writing the output and checking a diff.

@yorinasub17 
What would be the function behavior with check mode enabled? I assume, in case of success, the file won't be written out and error set to `nil`. But in case of failure,  when `newContents != contents` what would be the return value? Do you want to extend the function by additional return value with a type of bool?

I was imagining it would return an error. I am not a huge fan of overloading the meaning of an error, but in CI, we probably want to bubble an error in the end so that the command exits in a way that causes the build to fail.

The command should probably also be improved to not `failfast` and instead collect all failures as it goes and report it at the end, similar to what we do with `xxx-all` (of course, with improved error reporting!).

Basically, in this loop (https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/cli/hclfmt.go#L30), it should collect the errors in a larger error struct as opposed to just returning the error.

Yeah, totally. As long as the return code is not successful, that's fine. I am on the same page. 
Once I am in the office tomorrow, I will come up with PR. 

Thanks!

I did come up with PR. But I am unsure about using `terragruntOptions.TerraformCliArgs` to check Terragrunt specific options. What would be the best option here? 

Lastly, comments are more than welcome!

# No error message when Terraform isn't available

**marinalimeira** commented *Aug 3, 2022*

When trying to execute any Terragrunt command in a path where Terraform isn't available, I get no error message:

```
‚ùØ aws-vault exec sbox -- terragrunt apply --terragrunt-log-level debug --terragrunt-debug
DEBU[0000] Did not find any locals block: skipping evaluation.
DEBU[0000] Running command: terraform --version          prefix=[/Users/marina/go/src/github.com/gruntwork.io/testing123]
ERRO[0000] exit status 1
```

It should report `terraform not found`.

Hi,
I was wondering on which environment/Terragrunt version this happened, on my tests in Ubuntu / Terragrunt  v0.38.6:
```
$ terragrunt apply --terragrunt-log-level debug --terragrunt-debug
DEBU[0000] Did not find any locals block: skipping evaluation. 
DEBU[0000] Running command: terraform --version          prefix=[/projects/gruntwork/terragrunt-tests/issue-2223] 
ERRO[0000] exec: "terraform": executable file not found in $PATH 
ERRO[0000] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1 

```

I am on macOS 12.5 and terragrunt v0.38.6.

I experienced this today with terragrunt v0.45.8

Hi,
can be shared more details about the environment:
 * OS version
 * shell type/version
 * if any terraform wrappers are used
 * which is output of execution "terraform --version" in the shell

# Should a policy allowing the root user be added to state buckets?

**yhakbar** commented *Jul 22, 2022*

During a recent upgrade of Terragrunt, I noticed the very useful addition of skip-able configuration updates that seem to be geared towards improving the security posture of state resources.

https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#remote_state

I'd like some clarification to the purpose of the root access policy added that can be skipped with `skip_bucket_root_access`.

From what I understand, and have discussed with AWS support, granting the root user of an account access to a bucket through an s3 policy does not alter the accessibility of the bucket to the root user. What it does do, however is grant open read permissions to all IAM principals within that account. Given that Terraform does consider remote state sensitive information, it might make more sense to have that data accessible on a least privilege basis. Please let me know if I'm misunderstanding this policy.

Furthermore, should these state configuration updates be `yes`-able prompts during normal TG operations? In CI we frequently use the `--terragrunt-non-interactive` flag to ensure that runs aren't blocked by user prompts. Running any command in the latest version of Terragrunt results in the CI attempting to make the policy update remotely, which it shouldn't have permission to do if the service user/role associated with that run is granted least privilege.

What might be preferred is to state a warning that the configurations aren't set, along with instructions on how to ignore the warnings int the `remote_state` configuration block or run an independent command (like `terragrunt remote configure secure` or something) to configure them as a standalone operation from an engineer.

Hey @denis256 ,

Hope you don't mind me tagging you to get this on your radar.

Do you know if this is this the right way to address this kind of concern with Terragrunt? Would it be more appropriate to email the team at Gruntwork about this?

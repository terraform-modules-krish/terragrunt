# Feature: dont actually run terraform

**gtmtech** commented *Jun 1, 2023*

**Describe the solution you'd like**

Terragrunt is very useful as an orchestrator - so useful in fact that, I want to use it to orchestrate other things, not just terraform. I can do this with before_hook, and after_hook - so... is there any way of actually skipping running terraform as an optional attribute on the terraform block?

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

I looked for overriding the terraform binary to something else, but thats a bit hacky.

Hi, 
AFAIK, can be defined `terraform_binary` property to some dummy command, but it will still be hacky

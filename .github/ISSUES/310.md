# terraform.tfstate doubling in size

**akumria** commented *Oct 6, 2017*

It appears that if the S3 bucket used for remote state is versioned, terragrunt will include the prior version of the state file within the new state file.

In our case we see the terraform.tfstate file begin at: 4324436 bytes
Then: 7979758
Then: 15160972
Then: 29455311
...
We only detected this problem when the terraform.tfstate file hit: 456514779 bytes (435Mb)

Looking within the file we see that it appears to include only the most recent version of the terraform.tfstate (e.g. version 30 includes version 29; version 32 includes version 31, etc.)

Terragrunt: v0.13.3
Terraform: v0.10.2

AFAIK, Terragrunt doesn't directly write anything to your state file or S3 bucket, ever. This sounds like potentially a Terraform bug. Does this happen when you use Terraform directly? Or a different version of Terraform?

For our other projects we do not use terragrunt, and as far as I know we do not have this issue when using terraform directly. I will confirm on Monday when I am back at work.

Not sure if you ever got to the bottom of this, but closing due to lack of activity. Happy to reopen if you have more info.

# Feature request, exclude pattern for certain (dot-)files from sourced gh repository

**maartenvanderhoef** commented *Aug 12, 2022*

We work with asdf and have .tool-versions for our terragrunt repo and also a one in our stacks repo. We recently updated the .tool-versions and had the following problem.

1)
It sources from stacks modules to scratch dir, and is also copying the .tool-versions of the repo root. The sourced tag is a few versions behind and will have an older .tools-versions with an older version of terraform defined.

2)
terragrunt will run terraform init, and through asdf logic, this .tool-versions of terraform is used of the cloned repo. that terraform version is not configured, and terragrunt errors out.

With a hack we can delete that .tools-version from the scratch folder, but it would be nice to be able to exclude certain files without doing any operations. --exclude-files etc.

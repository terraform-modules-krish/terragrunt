I just read the doc in here https://www.terraform.io/language/modules#the-root-module
It seems to be that:


A project must have multiple root modules (What I thought before is that one project should have only one root module).

The root module must have a different s3 key

The child module, published module use same configure with the root module


So what the author mention is about the root module?

# Feature request: Path output from run-all

**edgan** commented *Jul 28, 2022*

In this [issue](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/2170) and the follow up pull request the paths for different states are called output for errors. It would be nice if they were called out in normal operation. This is achievable with `--terragrunt-log-level debug`, but I wouldn't want to turn it on all the time, and I don't want to have to remember to add it just for run-all. A cleaner version of output like this would be awesome. Then a user could tell which state is which in the output at a glance.

``--terragrunt-log-level debug` output:
```
DEBU[0023] Module /home/user/git/terraform/aws/development/us-east-2 has finished successfully!  prefix=[/home/user/git/terraform/aws/development/us-east-2] 
```

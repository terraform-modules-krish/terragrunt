# read_terragrunt_config does not skip over disabled dependencies, and will error if the dependency has a config path that doesnt yet exist.

**RyanBaker19** commented *Sep 27, 2023*

**Describe the bug**
When performing a read_terragrunt_config from a different .HCL to another .HCL that has dependencies, the .HCL with the dependency has its block read whether or not its enabled, when it should be skipped over if its not enabled. This means that if the block has a config path that doesnt exist, it will error even though the module itself will run.

A good subset of my config files utilize read terragrunt config and optional dependencies to achieve minimal definitions for the child HCL files using include blocks, but this completely breaks my process and makes terragrunt unusable with this new feature for dependency block.

**To Reproduce**
Create a .HCL file to read from where the config path is defined to a dependency path that doesn't exist, and then also set the dependency attribute of "enabled" to false.


// paste code snippets here
HCL with disabled dependency. It will run normally since it is false, and the call for the output is encapsulated in a try
```
dependency "example" {
 config_path = "/folder/" #this folder and path doesnt exist
 enabled = fileexists("/folder/terragrunt.hcl") #false
}

inputs {
example = try(dependency.example.outputs.test,null)
}

```

read_terragrunt_config HCL

```
locals {
  config = read_terragrunt_config("../dependency_example/terragrunt.hcl")
}
```
Not the best example, making it quickly but it should be obvious what you need to do to reproduce the steps here.

**Expected behavior**
The expected behavior is that read_terragrunt_config should skip over the dependency block, but its clearly processing it. This causes a glaring issue with any configs relying on read_terragrunt_config with optional dependencies based on file paths existing.

**Nice to have**
- [x] Terminal output
- [x] Screenshots

**Versions**
- Terragrunt version: Latest Version 0.51.x
- Terraform version: 1.5
- Environment details (Ubuntu 20.04, Windows 10, etc.): Alpine

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.

Can we expect a hotfix for this relatively soon? Currently, this makes read_terragrunt_config useless when utilizing optional dependencies

Additionally, will be helpful to provide a returned error and an example how to reproduce this issue

I tried to do a similar setup in https://github.com/denis256/terragrunt-tests/tree/master/issue-2734 but invocation of `read_terragrunt_config("../app1/terragrunt.hcl")` is working fine

Unfortunately my environment is kind of complex with how its linked, but I pinpointed the issue to this issue and resolved it by adding a dummy dependency (empty tf) to load instead.

The error just states that `read_terragrunt_config failed: {path_here}/terragrunt.hcl does not exist`

**I THINK the issue actually is when the dependency is appended to the config from an include file.** 

On app1, can you potentially create a separate HCL where you load the dependency (named dependency.hcl) and include it as such:
```
include "env" {
  path = "/env/dependency.hcl"
  expose = true
}
```

Then remove that dependency block from the terragrunt.hcl in app1? I believe this may actually cause the expected behavior, because this is how I have dependencies mostly setup.

Unfortunately I don't have the prowess to make a PR for this project, but want to be sure this issue is known.

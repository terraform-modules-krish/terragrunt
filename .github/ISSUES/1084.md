# Ability to print modules plan during apply-all

**asafha-etorox** commented *Mar 8, 2020*

We are using `terragrunt version v0.22.5` 

When using `apply-all`, terragrunt will only print what modules it's about to apply, but without printing the plan first.

Example:

```
[terragrunt] 2020/03/08 09:22:46 Stack at /path/to/my/module/vpc:
  => Module /path/to/my/module/vpc (excluded: false, dependencies: [/path/to/my/module/project])
  => Module /path/to/my/module/project (excluded: false, dependencies: [])
[terragrunt] 2020/03/08 09:22:46 [terragrunt]  Are you sure you want to run 'terragrunt apply' in each folder of the stack described above? (y/n)

```

I find printing plans during `apply-all` useful in situations when `plan-all` can't be used, like when target modules aren't applied yet, which forces to instead run `plan`/`apply` on each module sequentially.

It would be nice to have a single interactive plan/apply flow, no matter what module is missing :)

I think a request for an "interactive" version of `apply-all` has been requested before, but can't find it. An [RFC](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/community/contributing/#file-a-github-issue-or-write-an-rfc) for what this might look like would be very welcome!

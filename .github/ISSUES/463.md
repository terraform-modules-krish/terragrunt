# Run hooks conditionally (based on OS type, for example)

**antonbabenko** commented *Apr 19, 2018*

Using hooks in Terragrunt gives me almost all I can imagine, but I am looking for ways to be able to run them conditionally.

There are 2 use cases:
1. Run bash for Linux and PowerShell script for Windows (or even cygwin, which has different commands comparing to Linux)
2. Be able to enable or disable hook if Terraform variable or environment variable is set

Any ideas or workarounds?

This use case makes a ton of sense, since the script itself can't do such a check, but Terragrunt could. A PR for this would be very welcome.

Couldn't your script check for that env var and exit accordingly?

Yes, a script can do that but I think this code is more general:

```
    after_hook "copy_main_variables_on_windows" {
      commands = ["init"]
      execute_if = "${var.os_name == "Windows"}"
      execute  = ["cp.bat", "main_variables.tf", "."]
    }

    after_hook "copy_main_variables_on_linux" {
      commands = ["init"]
      execute_if = "${var.os_name != "Windows"}"
      execute  = ["cp.sh", "main_variables.tf", "."]
    }
```

Also having `${get_os_name()}` can be handy for this reason.

This is now possible using conditionals and [`get_platform`](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/built-in-functions/#get_platform).

@brikis98  Hey can you explain what do you mean by `conditionals`? I want to implement a `before_hook` based on an if condition but I couldn't find any way to do that.

@ShabihZaidi you can do something like the following:

```hcl
    after_hook "copy_main_variables_on_windows" {
      # We shut off this hook by using an empty list here so that the hook is not triggered on any command when the running platform is not Windows.
      commands = get_platform() == "windows" ? ["init"] : []
      execute  = ["cp.bat", "main_variables.tf", "."]
    }

    after_hook "copy_main_variables_on_linux" {
      # We shut off this hook by using an empty list here so that the hook is not triggered on any command when the running platform is Windows.
      commands = get_platform() != "windows" ? ["init"] : []
      execute  = ["cp.sh", "main_variables.tf", "."]
    }
```

# Mocked outputs not working for validate command

**timblaktu** commented *Nov 1, 2022*

I pushed the example code to repro the issue in [this repo](https://github.com/timblaktu/terragrunt-mocked-output-problem/blob/main/README.md). It is a simplified project of mine that produces the primary error on `terragrunt run-all validate`:

```
Unsupported attribute; This object does not have an attribute named "availability_zone_names".
```

This is the oft-reported error-case of **having not yet applied any of this infra yet**, but my understanding is that validate is supposed to work in this case with mocked outputs. In fact, that's the prime use case for having mocked outputs. (Right?)

I _feel_ I have tried all obvious permutations of specifying these paths in my .hcl files:

1. `terraform.source`
2. `terraform.before_hook.execute`
3. `dependency.config_path`

and using all various ways of specifying a path, e.g. for `modules/region/data`:

a. `"../../..//modules/region/data"`
b. `"${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}//modules/region/data"`
c. `"${get_terragrunt_dir()}"  # I know this one's incorrect`

I now always use the infamous double-slash in `terraform.source`, but the requirements around its placement is still quite _fuzzy_.

What _IS_ clear is that regardless of the source being local or remote, the `//` MUST be early enough in the path to enable terragrunt to copy from the correct node in the directory tree to provide all code needed to be referenced in the temp dir that it runs from.

Bringing all these pieces and mocks together.. Although now that I'm:

1. Using the double-slash correctly, which in my case means always putting it just before `//modules` so that `script/before_hook.sh` and friends can be accessed from the terragrunt temp/cache dir for all modules
2. Using relative paths (a. above) everywhere
3. Using dependency mocking religiously (I think):
    1. `mock_outputs` in all `dependency` stanzas.
    2. _NOT_ using `skip_outputs` in _ANY_`dependency` stanzas.
        1. ..although I've tried skipping outputs to no avail.
    3. `mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands = ["fmt", "validate"]`
    4. `mock_outputs_merge_strategy_with_state = "deep_map_only"`
        1. ..although I've tried `"no_merge"` and `"shallow"` to no avail

...**`terragrunt run-all validate` is still producing unresolveable `Unsupported Argument` errors from terragrunt not recognizing the output name of a module declared elsewhere as a dependency, and in this example, specifically the `availability_zone_names` output of `modules/region/data`, which has appropriate mocks defined.**

The full transcript of running the validate command with debug logging on is at my repo [here](https://github.com/timblaktu/terragrunt-mocked-output-problem/blob/main/terragrunt-run-all-validate.script.colorless).

Hi,
I checked mentioned repository, outputs were attempted to fetch through `dependency.region_data.availability_zone_names`, however, output variables are available in `outputs` field: `dependency.region_data.availability_zone_names` -> `dependency.region_data.outputs.availability_zone_names`

See more examples in:
https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#dependency

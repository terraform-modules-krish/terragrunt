# Support using S3 for locks

**bndw** commented *Mar 14, 2017*

Is it possible to store the lock along side the state in an S3 bucket? Are there any technical limitations?

The problem is that S3 is eventually consistent. Suppose Terragrunt User A writes the lock into S3 and that Terragrunt User B reads the lock a second later. S3 does not guarantee he'll actually see this value.

I'm going to close this comment but if you have any other questions, feel free to ask!

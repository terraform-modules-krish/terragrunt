# --terragrunt-include-dir has flaky behavior

**ChristophP** commented *Jul 31, 2019*

**The bug**
running `terragrunt apply-all` or `destroy-all` with the `--terragrunt-include-dir` flag, can result in different behavior based on the alphabetic ordering of folder names.

**How to reproduce?**
We'll have two test cases with two terragrunt stacks each. In both test folders the first stack has a dependency on the second one, specified in the `terragrunt.hcl`. The only difference between the test folders is that `test1` has a folder called `second` and `test2` has a folder called `_second`. The underscore makes it be alphabetically sorted before `first` whereas without it, it would come in, well, second.
```.
.
|----module
| |----main.tf
|----test1
| |----second
| | |----terragrunt.hcl
| |----first
| | |----terragrunt.hcl
|----test2
| |----_second     <- note the leading underscore here
| | |----terragrunt.hcl
| |----first
| | |----terragrunt.hcl
```
I prepared such a test repo [here](https://github.com/ChristophP/terragrunt-include-bug-example).
We run terragrunt in both directories from the root of the directory structure and get different results:
```sh
# test 1
terragrunt apply-all --terragrunt-working-dir test1 --terragrunt-include-dir first
  => Module /home/terragrunt-test/test1/first (excluded: false, dependencies: [/home/terragrunt-test/test1/second])
  => Module /home/terragrunt-test/test1/second (excluded: true, dependencies: [])
```
```sh
# test  2
terragrunt apply-all --terragrunt-working-dir test2 --terragrunt-include-dir first
  => Module /home/terragrunt-test/test2/_second (excluded: false, dependencies: [])
  => Module /home/terragrunt-test/test2/first (excluded: false, dependencies: [/home/terragrunt-test/test2/_second])
```

This could be fixed by making the following change in `configstack/module.go` [here](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/configstack/module.go#L182-L193)
<img width="753" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5880236/62273120-10d65f00-b43d-11e9-9b28-11ba2e79fc9a.png">
Should I open a PR for that?

On a side note. The current behavior of `--terragrunt-include-dir` is to include dependencies as well. I am not sure that is a good behavior especially when using `destroy-all`.
We for example have a couple of pieces of infrastructure which we shut down automatically overnight. We wanna keep the dependencies up though. The current behavior doesn't allow us to do that.
Can anyone share their thoughts on this?

I'm not sure I fully understand the bug. Why does the leading underscore / alphabetical order matter here?

As a general note, the way Terragrunt handles dependencies needs a lot of work. See https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/765, https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/272, and https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/524. Ideas and PRs to improve that (and fix this bug) are very welcome!

Hi @brikis98,

I am going to assume the following in my response:
*The desired behavior currently is to include all folders mentioned in the include flag AS WELL as their dependencies*

> I'm not sure I fully understand the bug. Why does the leading underscore / alphabetical order matter here?

**tl;dr**
The current code behaves in a way that it excludes previously included modules, which is undesirable. It shouldn't matter in which order the modules are processed, the exclusion/inclusion result should be the same. But that's not what the current implementation does. As you see above in the example, if we do a folder rename `second -> _second` the folder gets falsely excluded even though it is a dependency of the folder `first`.

**detailed explanation**
In pseudo code.
Case 1 (folders: `first` and `second`. where `first` has `second` as a dependency)
```
modules are [first, second]
first iteration:
  is "first" mentioned in include flags?
    YES -> include it (exclude = false)
           proceed to include it's dependencies, that means: include "second"
second iteration:
  is "second" mentioned in include flags?
    NO -> exclude it (exclude = true)
          "second" has no dependencies, so nothing left to do

RESULT: first (exluded =  false), second (excluded = true)
```
Case 2 (folders: `first` and `_second`. where `first` has `_second` as a dependency)
```
modules are [_second, first]
first iteration:
  is "_second" mentioned in include flags?
    NO -> exclude it (exclude = true)
          "_second" has no dependencies, so nothing left to do
second iteration:
  is "first" mentioned in include flags?
    YES -> include it (exclude = false)
           proceed to include it's dependencies, that means: include "_second"

RESULT: first (exluded =  false), second (excluded = false)
```
Does that make it clear to you?

PS: I also have a [repository](https://github.com/ChristophP/terragrunt-include-bug-example) with a minimal example to reproduce the bug prepared.

@brikis98 I didn't hear back on this issue and I am not sure where this ranks on the priority list but I wanted to make the bug clearer once more.
When running `terragrunt apply-all --terragrunt-include-dir firstDir` where `firstDir` has a dependency `secondDir` will NOT be included. However, when `secondDir` is renamed to `_secondDir` (also now `firstDir` depends on `_secondDir`) it WILL be included because of the way the implementation works at the moment. Same thing different outcome. Only difference being a name of a directory.

Thanks for the detailed explanation! Does indeed seem like a bug. A PR to fix it is very welcome!

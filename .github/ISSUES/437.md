# Hidden file not copied

**mazzy89** commented *Mar 15, 2018*

I have a module which has a file named `.npmrc`. It is important to provision correctly the module. Once the module is retrieved from git by Terragrunt the hidden "stuff" are not copied as said in [here](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/7fbf2c148beedbc5421974603220afa535e1d208/test/fixture-download/local-with-hidden-folder/.hidden-folder/README.md).

Any ways to control this behaviour?

How do I destroy a single resource created with Terragrunt?

Terragrunt is just a wrapper for Terraform. To destroy all resources with Terraform, you'd run `terraform destroy`, so with Terragrunt, you'd run `terragrunt destroy`. To destroy a single resource with Terraform, you'd run `terraform destroy -target=<RESOURCE>`, so with Terragrunt, you'd run `terragrunt destroy -target=<RESOURCE>`.

The target is the folder name, right?

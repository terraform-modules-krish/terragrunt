# [question] Hard coding the remote_state bucket name

**ozbillwang** commented *Jul 5, 2018*

Seems a simple feature, but I can't set it properly. 

s3 bucket need be global unique. So when run same codes to different aws accounts, I want to define remote_state bucket `postfix` in name, for example, `terragrunt-prod-terraform-state`

Then when apply the change, I hope the tfstat file are uploaded to `<account_id>-terragrunt-prod-terraform-state`, so I needn't hard code the bucket name directly.

how can I do that?

Not sure I follow. Can you give an example?

Sure, let me explain clearly.

in [terraform.tfvars](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example/blob/master/prod/terraform.tfvars)

```
terragrunt = {
  # Configure Terragrunt to automatically store tfstate files in an S3 bucket
  remote_state {
    backend = "s3"
    config {
      encrypt        = true
      bucket         = "terragrunt-example-prod-terraform-state"
      key            = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
      region         = "us-west-2"
      dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
    }
  }
```
How to define dynamic bucket name in above codes?

Seems I need define the same bucket name in [account.tfvars](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example/blob/master/prod/account.tfvars#L4) as well.

```
tfstate_global_bucket        = "terragrunt-state-global-prod"
tfstate_global_bucket_region = "us-east-1"
aws_profile                  = "prod"
```

Dynamic in what sense? 
***

**ozbillwang** commented *Jul 5, 2018*

can the bucket name be replaced as 

     bucket         = "<account_id>-terragrunt-example-prod-terraform-state"

You can try https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt#get_aws_account_id.

Perfect, that's what I look for.

Seems like the link is not valid anymore and I would like to use variables instead. There is also hardcoded region. What if I would like to use another region for another environment/account, including the state bucket? I tried to use variables but I got the following error:

`ERRO[0000] /Users/...myproject/deployments/terragrunt.hcl:8,42-45: Unknown variable; There is no variable named "env".
ERRO[0000] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1`

Where should be these root level terragrunt.hcl variables declared?

EDIT: I successfully followed this great example: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example

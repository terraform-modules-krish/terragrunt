# iam_role arn pulled from dependency broken

**awiesner4** commented *Oct 14, 2021*

It looks like there was a conscious decision to change the parsing for `iam_role` here:  https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1807

However, this has lead to breaking existing terragrunt functionality where we would create global IAM roles for a particular environment/account, and then use dependencies to pull in the arns like so:

```
dependency "iam" {
  config_path = "../../../../../../global/iam"
}

iam_role = dependency.iam.outputs.eks_admin_role_arn
```

When running with v0.31.5, this works without issue.  It now no longer works and I get the following error when running with newer versions:
```
ERRO[0000] /Users/awiesner/git-v2/ego-infra/aws/prod/us-east-2/tp/az-a/vpc1/tp0/eks/terragrunt.hcl:57,12-22: Unknown variable; There is no variable named "dependency"., and 1 other diagnostic(s) 
ERRO[0000] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1 
```

This is unfortunately a side effect of fixing another bug with `iam_role`. I'm a bit buried with other initiatives right now, but I'll be taking a look to see if there is a way to make this use case work. For now, I recommend using the older version that works for you, or looking to alternative means of getting that IAM role ARN.

FWIW, I think this is another evidence point for https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1840

Thank you, @yorinasub17 . Understood completely.  We're going to stay with our older version for now, and will also explore other ways of dynamically building the `iam_role` arn.

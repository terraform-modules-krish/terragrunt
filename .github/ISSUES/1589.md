# Unsupported attribute â€” but tfstate and output has the attribute

**TheBlackMini** commented *Mar 15, 2021*

I cannot figure this out, it's happened a couple of times and this time I'm unable to work around it.

The error I'm getting from terragrunt is

> terragrunt.hcl:25,47-50: Unsupported attribute; This object does not have an attribute named "id".

My issue is that the id which I'm trying to reference is present in the tfstate, why can it not see it?

Shortened code below terragrunt.hcl

tfstate pulled directly from backend storage account

The outputs are nested under `outputs`, so the path to `id` is `dependency.vm01.outputs.id`, not `dependency.vm01.id` as you are referencing in the code snippet. See [the `dependency` block reference](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#dependency) for more info.

Wow, thankyou! That was a rather stupid oversight.

# Better handling of Terraform plan output

**geekifier** commented *Mar 29, 2018*

## Problem

Currently Terragrunt supports the passing of `-detailed-exitcode` to the `terraform plan` command.

This results in Terragrunt passing on the `terraform plan` exit code back to the parent shell. 

However, Terragrunt treats any non-zero output of `terraform plan` as an exception, and presents the user with error messages.

It might be beneficial to always use -detailed-exitcode under the hood during plans, and then interpret the exit codes appropriately.

## Proposal

Instead of passing on the --detailed-exitcode flag to Terraform, always run plans with --detailed-exitcode, and update Terragrunt's interpretation of the exit codes to match [Terraform documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/plan.html#detailed-exitcode).

## Benefits

Terragrunt would have better understanding of `terraform plan` results, and present the end user with more accurate output.

I'm not convinced *always* running `-detailed-exitcode` for `plan` commands is a good idea (principle of least surprise), but when that flag is present, Terragrunt should check the exit code carefully and adjust its logging accordingly.

I think terragrunt already does certain automagical things under the hood that are somewhat abstracted away from the user.

Asking terraform for the detailed exit code to facilitate internal error handling does not strike me as some black box behavior that might affect the user, since the user is interacting directly with terragrunt, and not the terraform binary.

However, I can see where for backwards compatibility your approach is more prudent. 

I was mostly thinking in terms of improving this by the way of simplification, vs. introducing different parsing behaviors based on options.

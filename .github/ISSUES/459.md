# After init hook does not run unless run_on_error = true is set

**antonbabenko** commented *Apr 4, 2018*

First, thank you @eak12913 for adding hooks to Terragrunt!

I use Terragrunt v0.14.6 and wonder why this hook is not executed after `terragrunt init`:
```hcl
  terraform {
    after_hook "copy_common_stuff" {
      commands = ["init"]
      execute  = ["echo", "Yo!"]
    }
  }
```

Last output line is - `[terragrunt] 2018/04/04 16:21:29 Detected 1 Hooks` and `init` is all green, no errors during execution.

While this work as expected:

```hcl
  terraform {
    after_hook "copy_common_stuff" {
      commands = ["init"]
      execute  = ["echo", "Yo!"]
      run_on_error = true
    }
  }
```

And it produces this output:
```
[terragrunt] 2018/04/04 16:25:56 Detected 1 Hooks
[terragrunt] 2018/04/04 16:25:56 Executing hook: copy_common_stuff
[terragrunt] 2018/04/04 16:25:56 Running command: echo ...
```

Do I miss something?

Hey @antonbabenko. Thanks!

I've taken a look at your issue and it's definitely a bug in my code. I've made PR: #460 to resolve it.

# -out switch writes plan file to temp dir

**robinbowes** commented *Aug 30, 2017*

When using the `-out` switch, eg `-out=my_plan`, the `my_plan` file is written to the temp working directory rather than the current dir when the terragrunt command is run.

Of course, a workaround is to use an absolute path, but I think terragrunt should either munge the out file path when passing it to terraform, or copy it from the temp dir to the current working dir.

I think it is a security risk to leave the terraform plan file lying around on the tmp folder.

My thought is to have a parameter to remove the plan file after apply. For instance:
`terragrunt apply -rm-plan=$plan_file`

Where `$plan_file` is relative to the working directory.

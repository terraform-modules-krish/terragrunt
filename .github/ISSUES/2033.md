# Unsupported type function 

**wszarmach-koia** commented *Mar 8, 2022*

While using [type](https://www.terraform.io/language/functions/type) function which is available since Terraform 1.0 I get the following messages:

```
ERRO[0000] Error: Call to unknown function
    
ERRO[0000]   on /home/test/project/terragrunt/terragrunt.hcl line 20, in locals: 
ERRO[0000]   20:   vars           = { for key, value in local.vars: key => value if type(value) == "string" }

ERRO[0000] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1 
```

Terragrunt versions: 0.35.13 & 0.36.3
Terraform 1.1.7
OS: Linux, x86_64

The function is fine itself. Verified with **terragrunt console** for the same project.

Unfortunately, we can't import any terraform function past v0.15.3 due to a change in the internal structure of terraform that made all the function definitions private to the project.

I thought we documented this in the docs, but I do see that we haven't done so, so this is a documentation bug.

Thanks for the answer. I fully understand it. Is there any chance that it would be implemented inside Terragrunt itself ? This is one of those functions that cannot be easily replaced by some code.

Actually, I'm taking a look at the implementation and documentation, and I don't think we can actually implement this in Terragrunt. The implementation depends on being in console mode, which is something terragrunt doesn't have (and I assume doesn't satisfy your use case).

From [the docs](https://www.terraform.io/language/functions/type):

> This is a special function which is only available in the terraform console command.

Right, I didn't notice that part.I believe that we can close the ticket under given circumstances. Though, it would be useful. Thanks for your your time.

So how one can recognise if value is a map or not? Needed for deep merge workaround on terragrunt level

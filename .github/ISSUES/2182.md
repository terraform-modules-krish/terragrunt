# Actions to edit state file are not using service principal but personal account logged in the system (az cli)

**maonat** commented *Jul 8, 2022*

Hello,

Terraform version: `1.2.1`
Terragrunt version: `v0.38.4`

I have 5 subscriptions:
1) shared
3) nonprod
1) prod

I am storing all state files of each nonprod/prod subscription in the shared subscription in a specific storage account.

Everything works fine when I try to do terragrunt apply/destroy/plan

Yesterday I tried to import a configuration on the state file and I encountered a warning and an error:
```
Warning: "use_microsoft_graph": [DEPRECATED] This field now defaults to `true` and will be removed in v1.3 of Terraform Core due to the deprecation of ADAL by Microsoft.
Error: Error building ARM Config: obtain subscription(subscription-id-i-don't-want-to-show) from Azure CLI: parsing json result from the Azure CLI: waiting for the Azure CLI: exit status 1: ERROR: Please run 'az login' to setup account.
```
After seeing this I checked with TF_LOG=DEBUG and I could see that the issue is right there: It's failing something in the "Testing if Service Principal / Client Secret is applicable for Authentication.."
Here is the log
```

The above doesn't happen on a normal `terragrunt output`, which goes straight to the command output. Here's the log:

Probably this is causing many other endpoints.

My configuration is this one:

`./terragrunt.hcl`
``` hcl
skip = true

terraform {
  extra_arguments "retry_lock" {
    commands  = get_terraform_commands_that_need_locking()
    arguments = ["-lock-timeout=20m"]
  }
  extra_arguments "azure_variables" {
    commands = concat(get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars(), ["output", "show"])

    env_vars = {
      ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID = local.azure_vars.subscription_id
      ARM_TENANT_ID       = local.azure_vars.tenant_id
      ARM_CLIENT_ID       = local.azure_vars.client_id
      ARM_CLIENT_SECRET   = local.azure_vars.client_secret
    }
  }
}
...
...
...
remote_state {
  backend                         = "azurerm"
  disable_dependency_optimization = true
  generate = {
    path      = "backend.tf"
    if_exists = "overwrite"
  }
  config = {
    subscription_id      = local.shared_vars.storage_account_subscription_id
    resource_group_name  = replace(local.shared_vars.resource_group_name, "prod", "nonprod")
    storage_account_name = replace(local.shared_vars.storage_account_name, "prod", "nonprod")
    container_name       = local.shared_vars.container_name
    key                  = "state/${get_path_from_repo_root()}/terraform.tfstate"
  }
}

generate "provider" {
  path      = "provider.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite"
  contents  = <<EOF
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}
EOF
}
```

`./resource-group/terragrunt.hcl`
``` hcl
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

locals {
  secrets_git = yamldecode(try(file("secrets_git.yaml"), file(find_in_parent_folders("secrets_git.yaml"))))
}

terraform {
  source = "/somerwhere/modules//rg"
}

```

This is a blocker if someone does not have direct access to the resources. This will not allow the user to import state using a service principal.

I don't have any experience with Azure so I don't think I can offer too much help as to whether you are configuring Terragrunt correctly for Azure, but my guess as to the problem here is that `get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars` [doesn't include the `state` command](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/config/config_helpers.go#L38-L47), and thus the env vars you have configured are not being set when `terraform` is called.

This solved the issue. @yorinasub17

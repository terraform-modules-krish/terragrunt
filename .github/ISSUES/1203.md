Can we get a fresh build for 0.12.26 support?

Could you provide some context on what's in the new version that you need support for or that terragrunt is incompatible with?

Closing, as Terragrunt has supported 0.12, 0.13, and 0.14 for a while. https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/getting-started/supported-terraform-versions/

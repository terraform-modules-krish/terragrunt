# How to handle runtime inputs for module specific variables while using terragrunt run-all (all modules at once)

**meet101** commented *Jul 12, 2021*

Terraform is complaining about undefined variables while running `terragurnt run-all` commands with `-var` or `-var-file` argument.

In my case, I have a few modules (each one for a specific AWS service). running terrragrunt run-all commands to execute a plan or apply on all modules at once. most of the input variables are defined inside the env and module-specific terragurnt file using input block, but i have a need to take some of the inputs as a secret during runtime which I'm passing as `-var` or `-var-file` to `terragrunt run-all` command. Noticed that terragrunt is passing these input variables to all terraform modules as I'm running terragrunt run-all. I don't have all input variables defined in all modules as they are module-specific. Because of this, all modules where this input variable is not defined will fail with an undefined variable error.

To handle this I can think of a couple of workarounds as,
1 - Pass all input variables as **TF_VAR*** at runtime instead of -var or -var-file (This is not recommended way for complex variables)
2 - Even if it's module-specific variables, I need to duplicate and defined this variable in all modules - I can do this by creating a generate block inside terragrunt config. 

I feel this should be a common use case as deploying all terraform modules with terragrunt run-all command is a very cool feature.  being able to pass runtime inputs to the specific module is also a common requirement. Not sure if there is any better way to handle this case other than what I mentioned above. would like to get more idea on how are others handling this situation?

I found a comment on another open issue from @yorinasub17 that seems a good solution for my question here https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1603#issuecomment-805944075

This is by design, as it is recommended to track all the input variables in terragrunt and avoid having them injected externally. There are two recommended ways to handle secrets management in terragrunt that work with `run-all`:

- Use one of the helper functions to retrieve the secrets and feed it to the inputs. Either use [sops_decrypt_file](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/built-in-functions/#sops_decrypt_file) or [run_cmd](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/built-in-functions/#run_cmd) for this purpose.

- If your secrets are stored in secrets manager, consider adding logic in the terraform module to take in a secrets manager ARN as input and look it up using a data store.

@yorinasub17  Thanks for suggesting additional options. I have a restriction to inject all secret values externally and it's currently being passed as -var or -var-file. I can't use sops_decrypt_file or run_cmd to read secrets. I will look into another option to read secrets using the secret manager and data store. 

Still, just to confirm my understanding as you mentioned in #1603 (comment), `--terragrunt-strict` mode and default to relaxed, where:

relaxed: only error if missing required inputs
strict: error on unused vars as well

This will help in my use case as if it's set to "relaxed" it will allow passing extra inputs to all modules and it won't force me to define a variable for all the values that I'm passing as input using -var or -var-file. is my understanding correct?

Ah the `--terragrunt-strict` idea in the comment only applies to the `validate-inputs` command. Terragrunt will actually happily pass through extra inputs at runtime.

# upgrading to 0.39.2 gives Access denied in terragrunt plan

Hi there,

while trying to upgrade from `0.36.6` to `0.39.2`, I get the error below:

`Error checking if SSE is enabled for AWS S3 bucket my_bucket_name: AccessDenied: Access Denied`

Any idea what might fix this?

Cheers

found the problem, additional to the existing IAM policy, I had to add the following:

`      "s3:GetEncryptionConfiguration",
      "s3:GetBucketPolicy",
      "s3:GetBucketPolicyStatus",
      "s3:GetBucketPublicAccessBlock",`

Closing issue

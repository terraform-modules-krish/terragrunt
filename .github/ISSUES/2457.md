# Cannot install local helm chart.

**DavidConnack** commented *Feb 20, 2023*

I have a helm_release that looks as follows:
```
resource "helm_release" "karpenter_config" {
  count            = var.enabled ? 1 : 0
  name             = "karpenter-config"
  chart            = "./karpenter-config"
  depends_on = [helm_release.karpenter]
}
```

It fails to install with the following error:
```
module.karpenter.helm_release.karpenter_config[0]: Creating...

```
This is only happening with a local chart. Releases using a remote repository work correctly.
As far as I can see, this is not an issue with Terrafrom itself.
Perhaps something to do with how the relative paths are handled by Terragrunt?

Hi,
I suspect that the directory `karpenter-config` is not referenced correctly, I think should be used `${path.module}` since during execution TF modules are downloaded and used from `.terragrunt-cache`:

```
resource "helm_release" "karpenter_config" {
  count            = var.enabled ? 1 : 0
  name             = "karpenter-config"
  chart            = "${path.module}/karpenter-config"
}

```

You Sir are a legend.
Thank you, that worked perfectly.

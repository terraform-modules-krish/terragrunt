# Add option to specify target prefix when setting access logging on terraform state bucket

**dsecik** commented *Nov 24, 2020*

In addition to the `accesslogging_bucket_name` configuration option introduced in #1400 allowing to specify target bucket for s3 access logs, it would be handy to have an ability to specify also the target prefix to override the default `targetPrefix := "TFStateLogs/"` This will add more flexibility to access logging configuration, for example to be able to send access logs from multiple terraform state buckets to single logging bucket and not mix them together.

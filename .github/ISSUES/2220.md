# Terragrunt fails authentication to AWS where as Terraform authenticates well

**Divya1388** commented *Aug 2, 2022*

Hi Team,

We use okta cli to authenticate to AWS (local development and ci/cd we use ec2 assume role) and it generates an aws credentials file under ~/.aws

By enabling $env:AWS_PROFILE="dev", terraform is able to pick the appropriate access key and secret. 

However Terragrunt fails with the following error:

error configuring Terraform AWS Provider: error validating provider credentials: error calling sts:GetCallerIdentity: operation error STS: GetCallerIdentity, exceeded maximum number of attempts, 25, https response error StatusCode: 0, RequestID: , request send failed, Post "https://sts.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/": dial tcp 52.119.198.128:443: connectex: An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions.

Any help on this will be of great help

<br />

One thing i observed trying to debug this issue: 
Probably the .terragrunt-cache folder is the issue because if i run explicit terraform inside the subfolders in .terragrunt-cache, even terraform throws error. However if i move the subfolder created with random id to the parent level terraform runs fine.

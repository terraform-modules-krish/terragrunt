# Trying to use Terragrunt with Okta

**sebastianwth02** commented *Jul 24, 2018*

I am trying to leverage the use of Okta in Terragrunt and I am encoutering issues when assuming the role. 
My ~/.aws/config file
> aws_saml_url = home/amazon_aws/XXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXX
>
> [profile assume-admin]
> role_arn = arn:aws:iam::XXXXXXXXX:role/assumeAdmin
> region = us-west-2
>
> [profile dev]
> source_profile = assume-admin
> role_arn = arn:aws:iam::XXXXXXXXX:role/adminUser

Without terragrunt, using only Terraform and Okta, I don't see any issue.

> $ aws-okta exec dev -- bash
> $ terraform plan

Now using Terragrunt

> terragrunt plan
> [terragrunt] [/Users/user/dev/infrastructure/terraform/accounts/dev/us-west-2/dev/app] 2018/07/23 17:32:56 Running command: terraform --version

Thanks.

Also, do you have the `profile` you're using specified in the `provider` block in your Terraform code? If so, you probably need to specify the same `profile` in the `backend` config in your Terragrunt `terraform.tfvars`.

Alternatively, this might be an AWS Go SDK bug with assuming roles from other roles?

I was able to resolve this by setting 'AWS_CONFIG_FILE=/dev/null' after executing 'aws-okta exec takt-dev -- bash', which loaded my AWS_* creds/variables.

Using AWS_PROFILE=PROFILE_NAME or having the shell variables undefined with 'unset AWS_*' would return the error i mentioned above.

FYI. I'm running Terraform v0.11.7

This is still an issue... but it is with terraform rather than terragrunt.

Here is an example of a shared credentials file configuration that is supported by the [awscli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_pv/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-role.html)
```
# ~/.aws/credentials

[bastion] # these are fake credentials
aws_access_key_id = ASIA554SXDVIHKO5ACW2
aws_secret_access_key = VLJQKLEqs37HCDG4HgSDrxl1vLNrk9Is8gm0VNfA

[dev-spectator]
role_arn = arn:aws:iam::12345678901:role/spectator
source_profile = bastion
```

This works by caching credentials in the `~/.aws/cli/cache` directory. The awscli can read from this cache but terraform/terragrunt cannot.

**SOLUTION**
In order to support terraform/terragrunt, you will need something like:

```
# ~/.aws/credentials

[bastion] # these are fake credentials
aws_access_key_id = ASIA554SXDVIHKO5ACW2
aws_secret_access_key = VLJQKLEqs37HCDG4HgSDrxl1vLNrk9Is8gm0VNfA

[dev-spectator] # these are also fake credentials
role_arn = arn:aws:iam::12345678901:role/spectator
source_profile = bastion
aws_access_key_id = ASIA554SXXVIYYQRGGER
aws_secret_access_key = aw5/hbwzGP31s2lfC3ZQshKE+AZdlOYkqBUI4otp
aws_session_token = FQoGZXIvYXdHEY4aDDDbLp6g5sfNojzC6CKwAV+yefPfFg7y0xADMDECoddpj9WecBEReMtXkRjCVZfbSa1604EIK2q0zshlsP0PtF0e5wBZFDuZHTI464EpSQEXkJajksWeMMOe7PSzyJOX5Zqp8ve4ItHoE70tGxIVQjA06NbvodNjjOO/gsbDAcKHW1rx9wnq3RJ+dQbqqNq01R1vrDvTjxDNTrZr2wYI2qYrd9REP+mc44EeIO+3r0iuiwxRCL1UzS/4nG4IRYG2KMeo9esF

# Support environment variables with run_cmd

**gtmtech** commented *Dec 21, 2022*

Feature request:

It would be great if run_cmd was capable of setting environment variables before running the command. 

I want to run a command passing lots of data to it - and cli flags can only go up to 4k, whereas env vars can handle 128k on linux systems. 

Thanks

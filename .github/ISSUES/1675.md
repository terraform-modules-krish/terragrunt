# WARN[] No double-slash (//) found - on remote modules without submodules

**nkaravias** commented *May 14, 2021*

When doing a plan using a module that doesn't have submodules, terragrunt keeps throwing a warning. The double slash would address the issue if using submodules but the warning is redundant if you have a single flat module. 

Example:

```
terragrunt run-all plan  --terragrunt-working-dir "resources/platform" --terragrunt-log-level INFO
INFO[0000] Stack at resources/platform:
  => Module /<my home>/terraform/cloud-factory/resources/platform/folders/root (excluded: false, dependencies: [])
WARN[0000] No double-slash (//) found in source URL /terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-folders.git. 
Relative paths in downloaded Terraform code may not work.  
prefix=[/<my home>/terraform/cloud-factory/resources/platform/folders/root]
```

The terragrunt.hcl configuration used in this example:
```
terraform {
  source = "git::git@github.com:terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-folders.git?ref=v3.0.0"
}
```

The module in question has a flat structure with no submodules: https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-folders. I've seen a few threads about this but nothing with a permanent solution that addresses this for simple modules like the above mentioned one.

Using:

`terragrunt version v0.29.2`

`Terraform v0.15.3 on darwin_amd64`

I am also seeing this issue.

I'm using in this way and showing the same warning

```hcl
terraform {
  source = "github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-acm?ref=v3.0.0"
}
```
```sh
WARN[0000] No double-slash (//) found in source URL /terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-acm. Relative paths in downloaded Terraform code may not work.  prefix=[/Users/MY_PATH/] 
```

It would be great if we could disable this warning deliberately via some flag / ENV variable/configuration.

Ah, that's a good point. That logic needs to handle modules in the root of a repo better. PR to fix this is very welcome!

I see the same warning

workaround for source without submodules
terraform {
  source = "github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-acm//.?ref=v3.0.0"
}

double-slash(//) and a period (.)

We are getting the same issue when using the `tfr` source method. For instance:
```terraform
terraform {
  source = "tfr:///terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws?version=3.5.0"
}
```
results in a: 
```
No double-slash (//) found in source URL /terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws. Relative paths in downloaded Terraform code may not work...
```

The above fix also works for `tfr` sources: 
```terraform 
terraform {
  source = "tfr:///terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws//.?version=3.5.0"
}

```
A more systemic solution would be appreciated though as this is a Terragrunt issue, not a module issue.

Just hit this issue. Commenting for visibility.

Getting same error for:
`source = "git@github.com:terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-s3-bucket.git"`
Fixed by adding `//.`
`source = "git@github.com:terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-s3-bucket.git//."`

**adamwshero** commented *Feb 2, 2022*

As others have mentioned, adding a trailing '.' at the end of the path solves but would appreciate a better solve for this.

`  source = "git::git@github.com:terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-autoscaling.git//.?ref=v4.11.0"
`

The //. doesn't work when using the find_in_parent_folders function.

```
terraform {
  source = find_in_parent_folders("_resources///_vpc")
}
```

**josefloressv** commented *Jul 31, 2022*

Workaround when you use functions.
See de triple slash at the end, that works for me

```hcl
terraform {
  #source = "${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/../modules/stacks/${local.stack_name}/"
  source = "${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/../modules/stacks/${local.stack_name}///"
}
```

**OriBenHur-akeyless** commented *Nov 7, 2022*

this is working for me
```terraform
terraform {
  source = "${find_in_parent_folders("modules/global/dns")}///"
}
```
The trick here is the `///` at the end

**drueck** commented *Apr 8, 2023*

I did a little digging into this today, and it looks like this issue happens because terragrunt is using the `getter.Detect` function from https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter to parse the source strings, and if the source string is in a somewhat non-canonical format such as `git::git@github.com:foo...`, `getter.Detect` transforms it into `git::ssh://git@github.com/foo...`. When it does this, if there are trailing `//` at the end of the source string, it removes them.

So, if your source is `git::github.com:terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-acm//?ref=v3.0.0` for example, `getter.Detect` will transform it into `git::ssh://git@github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-acm?ref=v3.0.0`. Note that it has removed the `//`. 

Then when this `sourceUrl` is passed into the `splitSourceUrl` function in the terragrunt code, it raises this warning because there is now no `//` in the transformed source url even though the original source had it.

So, yet another workaround is to use the more canonical URL (`git::ssh://git@github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-acm//?ref=v3.0.0`) to begin with, which `getter.Detect` will not have to transform. In this case it leaves the `//` in, and terragrunt's `splitSourceUrl` function no longer throws the warning.

I'm not sure if the go-getter library could/should be patched to leave the trailing `//` in, or if there's a good reason for it to remove them, but it seems like maybe it could be an issue for them to consider there.

That did it for me, thank you, bud

This is also an issue for `/dev/null` (hack used for decommissioned modules ðŸ˜… )

```hcl
terraform {
  source = "/dev/null"
  # switched off since not needed
}
```

..

```
level=warning msg=No double-slash (//) found in source URL /dev/null. Relative paths in downloaded Terraform code may not work...
```

I'm seeing this as well after following this tutorial using Terragrunt 0.50.9:
https://blog.gruntwork.io/how-to-manage-multiple-environments-with-terraform-using-terragrunt-2c3e32fc60a8

That blog even uses relative module paths as an example:

# Issue when using --terragrunt-source when a module dependency is on a different Git repository

**michelzanini** commented *Sep 17, 2020*

I have the following folder structure:

```
.
├── eks
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
└── vpc
    └── terragrunt.hcl
```

On `eks` I am importing a Git module such as:

```
terraform {
  source = "git@bitbucket.org:company/terraform-aws-eks-module.git?ref=master"
}

dependency "vpc" {
  config_path = "../vpc"
}
```

On the `vpc` folder I import another Git module, a totally different repository:

```
terraform {
  source = "git@bitbucket.org:company/terraform-aws-vpc-module.git?ref=master"
}
```

Sometimes, I am testing local changes to the `eks` module, and I want to use a local version of the source code to avoid committing changes to a branch to test it. 

Both repositories are cloned locally on `~/git` folder. 

When I do:

```
cd eks
terragrunt plan --terragrunt-source ~/git/terraform-aws-eks-module
```

I get:

```
[terragrunt] 2020/09/17 14:30:54 Did not find any Terraform files (*.tf) in ~/git/terragrunt-project/vpc/.terragrunt-cache/x8mfE_ZvAC1E31uXzInOVIdKsfs/sfAihJo8SRsjA8pstYtGUtBaKmE/terraform-aws-vpc-module
```

That's because, `vpc` is a dependency of `eks`, and that module is not found on `~/git/terraform-aws-eks-module`.

I understand usually Terragrunt uses the same "live" repository for all `source` attributes, so then all modules are on the same repository. If that was the case there would be no problem as it would find both modules on the same place.

I wonder if it is not possible to still be able to use `--terragrunt-source` on this use case I have.

I see a few options:

1. Another flag to disallow looking at dependencies with `--terragrunt-source`, something like:

```
terragrunt plan --terragrunt-source ~/git/terraform-aws-eks-module --terragrunt-source-no-dependencies
```

2. Maybe on the dependency block we could say if we want to participate on `--terragrunt-source`:

```
dependency "vpc" {
  config_path = "../vpc"
  terragrunt-source-ignore = true
}
```

3. Terragrunt could automatically ignore dependencies for `--terragrunt-source` if they are coming from different Git repos than the module we are running. So it would work correctly with "live" single repositories by changing the source on all modules, while still avoiding this if the repositories are not the same. Possibly this logic can be tricky but definitely the one with less user configuration.

---

For now, my workaround is to comment the files while I am doing such work, and revert it after I am done:

```
terraform {
  //source = "git@bitbucket.org:company/terraform-aws-eks-module.git?ref=master"
  source = "/Users/myuser/git/terraform-aws-eks-module"
}

terraform {
  //source = "git@bitbucket.org:company/terraform-aws-vpc-module.git?ref=master"
  source = "/Users/myuser/git/terraform-aws-vpc-module"
}
```

Thanks.

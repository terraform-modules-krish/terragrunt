# Graph representation of the terragrunt dependencies similar to terraform graph

**mauriciopoppe** commented *Apr 5, 2020*

It would be great to have a visual representation similar to `terraform graph` but with the terragrunt dependencies, something like:

```sh
terragrunt plan-all --terragrunt-graph | dot -Tsvg > graph.svg
```

This could be applied to the *-all commands

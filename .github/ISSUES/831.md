# get a output from one module into another

**rmolson** commented *Aug 12, 2019*

I am trying a greenfield deployment using terragrunt. I am trying to pass the output of one module into another.

in native terraform it would just be module.name.output_var

I don't see a way to get the output of a module into a variable that can be used else ware.  What am I missing?

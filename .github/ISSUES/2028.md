# Terragrunt won't recognize source's directory when it is hidden

Hey there, I saw that terragrunt do not copy hidden files, but it seems that it also ignores them even when you explicitly specify them on the source argument, here is an example:

/example.txt
```
some-data
```

/.infra/main.tf
```hcl
resource "local_file" "read_from_root" {                                                                                                                                                    
    filename = "re-write-file.txt" 
    content = file("../example.txt")
}
```
/.infra/env/testing/terragrunt.hcl
```
terraform {
  source = "../../..//.infra"
}
```

running terragrunt inside the testing folder, results in this:
```
terragrunt init
ERRO[0000] Working dir .infra from source file:///home/jayson/terragrunt-bug does not exist 
ERRO[0000] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1
```

Shouldn't it copy the folder as it is explicitly stated?
Thanks in advance!

Hello,
AFAIK, was implemented by intention to skip names that start with dot:

I was also bitten by this today in that terraform included a hidden dir in a cloud function zip using an `archive_file` resource but after converting the codebase to terragrunt and applying (which recreated the function), the function no longer contained that folder and ceased to, well, function. :-)

IMO, excluding _all_ hidden directories is surprising behavior.  What about limiting the list to `.terra*` or similar?

# Expand the set of built-in functions

**levkohimins** commented *Aug 26, 2023*

According to [ticket](https://gruntwork.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/110393), we need to add two new built-in functions:
1. `get_cache_dir()` - returns path to terragurnt cache directory
2. `get_terraform_output()` - returns terraform output, which can later be passed to the script in hooks

Please prioritise this issue as i tis important to add this feature request. Also, ensure that you are going to communicate the release number of terrarrunt application which will support get_cache_dir() and get_terraform_output() which will be passed to the script from the hooks.

@mirconstantin We will do our best to make the development of these built-in functions as fast as possible. As soon as we're done, I'll be sure to let you know the version containing these improvements.

After analyzing the issue, it became clear that this functionality is not needed. I close the question.

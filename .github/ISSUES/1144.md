# Could not find Terragrunt configuration settings in $PWD/terraform.tfvars

**nspyke** commented *Apr 18, 2020*

Running any terragrunt command throws this error (paths hidden / replaced with $PWD);
```
[terragrunt] [...] 2020/04/18 18:37:51 Running command: terraform --version
[terragrunt] 2020/04/18 18:37:51 Reading Terragrunt config file at $PWD/terraform.tfvars
[terragrunt] 2020/04/18 18:37:51 Could not find Terragrunt configuration settings in $PWD/terraform.tfvars
[terragrunt] 2020/04/18 18:37:51 Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1
```
But a terraform.tfvars and a terragrunt.hcl exist in the PWD.
```
$ ls -l
total 16
-rw-r--r-- 1 nik nik 893 Feb 20 20:29 main.tf
-rw-r--r-- 1 nik nik 599 Feb 20 20:29 outputs.tf
-rw-r--r-- 1 nik nik   0 Apr 18 18:26 terraform.tfvars
-rw-r--r-- 1 nik nik 218 Apr 18 18:29 terragrunt.hcl
-rw-r--r-- 1 nik nik 103 Feb 16 16:57 variables.tf
```
Contents of terragrunt.hcl
```
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

terraform {
  extra_arguments "common_vars" {
    commands = get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars()

    arguments = [
      "-var-file=../../account.tfvars"
    ]
  }
}
```
terraform.tfvars is empty as I'm expecting terragrunt to read the terraform.tfvars from the terraform project root

I'm running Ubuntu 19.10. Terragrunt was installed using Snap.
```
terragrunt            0+git.ae675d6               16    latest/stable    terraform-snap
```

On my Windows PC with Terraform 0.12.24 and Terragrunt 0.23.8 in the same project directory and identical files, Terragrunt works as expected.

Looks like the Snap package is out of date.

How can I install the Linux package on the releases page? Or is Ubuntu not a supported OS?

Sorry.. closing. A manual install of the 0.23 release has resolved the problem.

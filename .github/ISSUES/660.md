# Terragrunt does not initialize S3 backend and don't create bucket/table

**wintergren** commented *Feb 20, 2019*

Hi, 

Recently started out with Terragrunt and have setup a live-repo and a modules repo. Want to use S3 as  a backend but I can not get it to work. 

- First issue is that Terragrunt does not initialize the backend properly (i.e. creating the bucket and dynamodb table). 
- Secondly when I run plan on the live part that uses my remote module it will query me to input name of the S3 bucket, the key etc.

I don't know what is causing both of these issues and want some help. Have tried to follow the modules and live example repos as much as possible.

**Versions:**
terragrunt v0.17.4
terraform v0.11.11
aws provider v1.59.0 

Live repo
----------
```
aws-eks (repo name)
  - live
    - account-name
      * account.tfvars
      * terraform.tfvars
      - eu-central-1
        - dev
          - eks
            * terraform.tfvars
```

aws-eks/live/account-name/terraform.tfvars:

```
terragrunt = {
  
  # Configure root level variables that all resources can inherit
  terraform {

    # Configure Terragrunt to automatically store tfstate files in an S3 bucket
    remote_state {
      backend = "s3"
      config {
        encrypt        = true
        bucket         = "terragrunt-eks-dev-state-${get_aws_account_id()}"
        key            = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
        region         = "eu-central-1"
        dynamodb_table = "terraform-eks-state-lock-dynamo"
      }
    }
    extra_arguments "bucket" {
      commands = ["${get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars()}"]
      optional_var_files = [
        "${get_tfvars_dir()}/${find_in_parent_folders("account.tfvars")}"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

terragrunt = {
  # Terragrunt will copy the Terraform configurations specified by the source parameter, along with any files in the
  # working directory, into a temporary folder, and execute your Terraform commands in that folder.
  terraform {
    source = "git::ssh://git@bitbucket.domain.com:7999/pe/terraform-modules.git//eks?ref=v0.0.4"
  }

  # Include all settings from the root terraform.tfvars file
  include = {
    path = "${find_in_parent_folders()}"
  }
}
```

Component/Modules repo
----------

```
terraform-modules (repo name)
  - eks
    * main.tf
    * variables.tf
```

terraform-modules/eks/main.tf:

```
provider "aws" {
  region = "${var.region}"
}

terraform {
  # The configuration for this backend will be filled in by Terragrunt
  backend "s3" {}
}

# Rest of the code is omitted
```

Output
----------
If I do a **terragrunt init** from the console while standing in the "account-name" folder of the live repo I just get this:

```
*****************:account-name *******$ terragrunt init
[terragrunt] [/Users/***********/repo/aws-eks/live/account-name] 2019/02/20 15:47:02 Running command: terraform --version

[terragrunt] 2019/02/20 15:47:03 Running command: terraform init

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```
If I look in S3 there is no new state bucket created, and no table setup in DynamoDB. I thought based on the terragrunt documentation that this should be setup if not already existing. Why is it not working?

If I run **terragrunt plan** in live repo and the leaf **eks** folder:

```

So again, some weird behavior here as I expected Terragrunt to fill in the backed info in the sourced module/component **eks** where I did put in a block like this:
```
terraform {
  # The configuration for this backend will be filled in by Terragrunt
  backend "s3" {}
}
```

Hope it's just something simple I've missed :)

Quick question - could you please explain how you're authenticating to the AWS account in which you are going to be `terragrunt apply`ing those changes?
***

**wintergren** commented *Feb 21, 2019*

@eak12913 you may be on to something. I had stated the profile to use in the accounts.tfvars file as described in the live example repo https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example/blob/master/prod/account.tfvars

```
# Root level variables that all modules can inherit. This is especially helpful with multi-account configs
# where terraform_remote_state data sources are placed directly into the modules.

aws_profile                  = "terraform-ro"
region                       = "eu-central-1"
```

In my console I have the same AWS_PROFILE env variable setup. So question is then if Terragrunt actually uses the aws_profile variable setup in account.tfvars. It is provided in the extra_arguments block in my topmost terraform.tfvars where also the backend is defined.

Actually I have the exact same issue, `terragrunt apply` prompts me for the backend values instead of getting them from `remote_state.backend.config` block in the `terraform.tfvars` at the root of my modules repo.

```
terragrunt = {
  remote_state {
    backend = "s3"
    config {
      bucket         = "my-own-terraform-bucket"
      key            = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
      region         = "eu-west-3"
      encrypt        = true
      dynamodb_table = "my-terraform-lock-table"

      s3_bucket_tags {
        name  = "Terraform states storage"
      }

      dynamodb_table_tags {
        name  = "Terraform lock table"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

As @anderssoder, I also have an accounts.tfvars as described in your example-live repo
```
# Root level variables that all modules can inherit. This is especially helpful with multi-account configs
# where terraform_remote_state data sources are placed directly into the modules.

tfstate_global_bucket_region = "eu-west-3"
aws_profile                  = "default"
```
The profile is described in my `~/.aws/credentials` and `~/.aws/config`

Is this an issue or a misconfiguration ?

@mehdibechiri interesting, glad I'm not alone! Do wonder what the problem is, an issue or misconfig? Probably misconfig, but I can't see what it is.

One thing I've noted  is that when I have this configured in the topmost terraform.tfvars:
```
optional_var_files = [
        "${get_tfvars_dir()}/${find_in_parent_folders("account.tfvars")}"
      ]
```

and then run terragrunt init in that folder it does not use account.tfvars:
```
[terragrunt] 2019/02/21 11:03:22 Reading Terragrunt config file at /Users/*******/repo/aws-eks/live/account-name/terraform.tfvars
[terragrunt] 2019/02/21 11:03:22 Skipping var-file /Users/*******/repo/aws-eks/live/account-name/ignore as it does not exist
[terragrunt] 2019/02/21 11:03:22 Running command: terraform init

Terraform has been successfully initialized!
```
terraform init is run without any var files as is seen from the output. I've tested back and forth quite a bit how to define the optional_var_files and using the different built-in terragrunt functions to get it to use account.tfvars in all cases - if I execute in the account-name folder where I have the "root" terraform.tfvars and account.tfvars or when executing in the leaf eks folder. Seen some different results in terms of how it runs terraform init. Right now it seems to pickup account.tfvars when executing in eks folder. Still asking for S3 bucket name etc and still haven't got terragrunt to create the needed backend resources. 

I'm so far in the bubble and mess of this so hard to see clearly what I'm doing wrong :)

You've nested the `remote_state` configuration in a `terragrunt { terraform { ... } }` block, whereas it should actually be a top-level item directly in the `terragrunt { ... }` block. Please check the docs for lots of examples.

**wintergren** commented *Feb 21, 2019*

@brikis98 thanks, that was it! Even though I looked at it many times, did not see it. Works now :)

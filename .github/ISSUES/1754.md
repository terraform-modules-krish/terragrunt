# Windows installer blocked by Microsoft Defender SmartScreen

**sparrowt** commented *Jul 22, 2021*

If I download and attempt to run the windows installer of a recent release (by double-clicking on it) I see the following screen saying "Windows protected your PC" // "Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognised app from starting. Running this app might put your PC at risk."

Clicking 'More info' shows "Application: terragrunt_windows_amd64.exe" "Publisher: Unknown publisher"

This happens on both of these installers:
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/download/v0.31.0/terragrunt_windows_amd64.exe
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/download/v0.31.1/terragrunt_windows_amd64.exe
as well as a much older one just for sake of checking if this is caused by a recent terragrunt change:
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/download/v0.25.4/terragrunt_windows_amd64.exe

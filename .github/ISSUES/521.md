# apply-all  can result in confirmation duplication

**bendavies** commented *Jul 13, 2018*

Hey there, 

Running `apply-all` may result in duplication of confirmations if more than one module depends on the same dependency. these could be de-duplicated?

```
âžœ  terragrunt apply-all
[terragrunt] 2018/07/13 10:46:08 [terragrunt]  Module foo depends on module bar, which is an external dependency outside of the current working directory. Should Terragrunt run this external dependency? Warning, if you say 'yes', Terragrunt will make changes in bar as well! (y/n)
yes
[terragrunt] 2018/07/13 10:46:08 [terragrunt]  Module baz depends on module bar, which is an external dependency outside of the current working directory. Should Terragrunt run this external dependency? Warning, if you say 'yes', Terragrunt will make changes in bar as well! (y/n)
yes
```

Cheers

Strange, it should already de-dupe these. Could you by any chance share the real log output? I suspect this may be an issue where it's not using "canonical paths," so it gets tripped up by the same path being represented in two different ways.

Hi.

Just to say, it's not a canonical path issue, I've the same issue with a copy pasta.

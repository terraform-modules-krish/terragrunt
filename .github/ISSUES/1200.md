# --terragrunt-parallelism should not be passed to terraform

**gmyx** commented *May 26, 2020*

I was doing some debugging and wanted to reduce or disable parallelism to figure out where my apply-all was failing. I tried to use: 
`terragrunt apply-all --terragrunt-parallelism 4`

But it immediately fails with terreform errors. Terraform does not like the unknown parameter. This can be shown with an empty folder and terraform apply --terragrunt-parallelism 4.

It seems terragrunt specific parameters are being passed to terraform and should not.

Terraform v0.12.24
Terragrunt v0.23.10
Windows Terminal on Windows 10 1909

That flag was only added in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.23.16. Please upgrade and try again!

I will have to hide in shame, should of checked for new version first. It works with 23.16. Sorry about that!

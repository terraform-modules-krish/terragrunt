# Terragrunt's `sops_decrypt_file()` does not work with GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS environment variable

**macsb** commented *Feb 28, 2023*

Hi
We use `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` with the service account's private key in our CI to authenticate with GCP. Recently, we decided to add `sops_decrypt_file()` to our CI to pass some credentials down to the module which is supposed to work with `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` according to this [PR](https://github.com/mozilla/sops/pull/953) but we are consistently getting:

`Call to function "sops_decrypt_file" failed: Error getting data key: 0 successful groups required, got 0.`

We are running sops [v3.7.3](https://github.com/mozilla/sops/releases/tag/v3.7.3). I was able to reproduce this error on my local with a dummy Terragrunt/Terraform module and only `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` set.
Binary `sops --decrypt secretsfile.yaml` works fine. Only `sops_decrypt_file()` doesn't.

The very same Terragrunt/Terraform configuration works fine when using application default credentials.

Does `sops_decrypt_file()` work with `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS`?

```
Terraform v1.3.9
terragrunt version v0.44.0
sops 3.7.3 (latest)
```

Would anyone be able to look at this? I can see `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` have been added in #907 a long time ago. Is there a chance `sops_decrypt_file()` is not using them correctly?

We have the same problem, it blocks us from using GCP federated authentication in CircleCI.

Bychecking the `go.mod` I see that terragrunt uses sops `v3.7.2` but the feature in mentioned [PR](https://github.com/mozilla/sops/pull/953) is in `v3.7.3` (https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/d185ed96d24ff59c906c28a019a9b2cdf29f760e/go.mod#L32). Can we bump up the sops library used by Terragrunt?

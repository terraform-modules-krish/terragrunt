# Unclear documentation for locals

**bholzer** commented *Feb 26, 2020*

In the local documentation, the final line includes:

`Note that because locals is a block, there currently is a way to merge the map into the top level`

Is this a typo, intending to relay that there is no way to merge locals?

Is the `common_vars` method described in the docs the suggested way to inherit some locals through the hierarchy?

Ah yes this is indeed a typo! The `locals` blocks will not merge through the `include` references. The `common_vars` method or using [read_terragrunt_config](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/built-in-functions/#read_terragrunt_config) are the ways to inherit locals.

Also see https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1025 for relevant context.

Thanks for the confirmation.

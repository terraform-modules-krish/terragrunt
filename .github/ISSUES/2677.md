# Show sub-directory name in logs when running on multiple directories at once

**daftkid** commented *Aug 19, 2023*

**Describe the solution you'd like**
If I run `terragrunt run-all` within the directory with sub-directories (layers), terragrunt show logs all together and it's hard to understand which layer a particular log belongs to. For example, I have 10 sub-directories, run `terragrunt run-all plan`, and only one directory shows some diff, there are no ways to understand which directory actually has some drift (well, I can see the list of resources and their names in the plan output, but that's not a very convenient way to determine which directory is drifted).

I'd like to have some option to show directory names for each log entry generated by terragrunt.

I was not able to find any options to show me logs in the way I need, thus I created this feature request

Hi,
was attempted to use `--terragrunt-include-module-prefix`?

Hi, did not see this option for some reason...
Yeah, it did the trick but now output is kind of a mess, EACH line is prepended with the full path to the directory, even each plan line. Any chances to get it grouped? I mean, for example, show the directory path only for the first line of the plan output. Or at least show relative path instead of the absolute one :)

# infinite recursion with read_terragrunt_config

**spacerainbow000** commented *Feb 21, 2022*

if child terragrunt file B includes parent terragrunt file A, and A reads B with read_terragrunt_config, terragrunt will be stuck in an infinite loop of evaluating file B's include block, then file A's include block, then back to file B's include block, etc. when this happens no error is printed, the only way to tell is to look at debug logs, which will print messages like `DEBU[0059] Found locals block: evaluating the expressions.` forever. file A:
```
locals {
  child_terragrunt_hcl = read_terragrunt_config("${get_original_terragrunt_dir()}/terragrunt.hcl")
}
```
file B:
```
include "global_configs" {
  path           = find_in_parent_folders()
  merge_strategy = "deep"
  expose         = true
}
```
I tried doing a string replace on the contents of file B before reading it with read_terragrunt_config and replacing it with a different path that just sources an empty terragrunt config, but the function doesn't take a string, only a filepath, and i can't think of a way to get file B, do the necessary string replacement, then write the file somewhere else, and anyway that's an awkward way to do it.

it'd be nice for there to be some smarts in the way read_terragrunt_config parses the include block - maybe some kind of check to make sure the include "tree" doesn't ever include the same file twice? being able to actually do this without encountering the forever loop would be ideal, but some kind of error instead of just hanging (assuming log level < debug) is probly a minimal fix

btw if anyone knows a workaround for this i would love to hear it. specifically I need to somehow get the value of the child terragrunt `dependencies` block from inside the parent terragrunt file

Hi,
depends on what is required to achieve, if it is required to load child-specific configuration - configuration can be extracted in separated HCL file and loaded from parent.


```
# parent.hcl
locals {
  child_terragrunt_hcl = read_terragrunt_config("${get_original_terragrunt_dir()}/config.hcl")
}

# child terragrunt.hcl

include "global_configs" {
  path           = find_in_parent_folders("parent.hcl")
  merge_strategy = "deep"
  expose         = true
}

inputs = {
  x = include.global_configs.locals.child_terragrunt_hcl.locals.data
}

# child config.hcl

locals {
  data = "child config"
}

```

Recursion is happening as described example

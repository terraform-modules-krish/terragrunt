# Error moving env files to a different folder from the parent folder

**syedchandpatel** commented *Aug 30, 2022*

We have a requirement, we want to move these account.hcl & region.hcl to a different folder from the parent_folder, I tried by using different methods in the terragrunt.hcl file but it always gives error. Is this possible to move these files to a different folder or it needs to be in the parent_folder itself ?

**Standard Terragrunt structure**
 locals {
  # Automatically load account-level variables
  account_vars = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("account.hcl"))

  # Automatically load region-level variables
  region_vars = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("region.hcl"))

**Tried methods -** 
locals {
  # Automatically load account-level variables
  account_vars = ${get_terragrunt_dir()}/../../account.hcl"

  # Automatically load region-level variables
  region_vars = ${get_terragrunt_dir()}/../../region.hcl"

Hi,
`get_terragrunt_dir()` can be used to obtain path to working directory, but result should be passed to `read_terragrunt_config` to be parsed as HCL

```
locals {
  account_vars = read_terragrunt_config("${get_terragrunt_dir()}/../config/account.hcl")
}
```

Also can be used other functions to get root of git repository `get_repo_root` and from there to reference required files

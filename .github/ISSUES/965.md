# Piping output to file with terragrunt

**ivasilyev-servicetitan-com** commented *Nov 29, 2019*

Hello.

I'm trying to get simplified output of terraform with the help of [terraform-plan-reviewer](https://github.com/thtran101/terraform-plan-reviewer) and Terragrunt.

Basically, I'm running `terragrunt plan-all -out=plan` to generate plan files on every folder with TF files.
Then I need to apply `terraform show -json plan > plan.json` but with the help of Terragrunt.
I'm trying to run `terragrunt "show -json plan > plan.json"` at least in one folder but get the following
```
/data/dev/compute/create-scalesets-dev # TERRAGRUNT_DEBUG=true terragrunt "show -json plan > plan.json"

Is there a way to do this with Terragrunt?
I also looked at [TG Hooks](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt#before-and-after-hooks) - but it doesn't look to be helpful in this scenario.

what happens if you just run `terragrunt show -json plan > plan.json` (without the quotes)?

**ivasilyev-servicetitan-com** commented *Dec 1, 2019*

In that case it will run
```
[terragrunt] 2019/12/02 09:36:10 Running command: terraform show -json plan
```
and then will pipe terragrunt's output out into plan.json file - that's not what I need.

I managed to do what I need with the following after_hook
```
after_hook "after_hook_plan" {
    commands     = ["plan"]
    execute      = ["sh", "-c", "terraform show -json plan > plan.json"]
  }
```

Terragrunt stdout is terraform stdout, so it should work. Actual terragrunt logging is wired to stderr... But, glad you got it working either way.

In the newer versions you can doe
`terragrunt run-all show -json plan`

@dverbeek84 it doesn't help to have all plans in one massive file.

As a small addition you can scope this to run on non-windows, since `sh` is not supported. This is now possible using conditionals and [get_platform](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/built-in-functions/#get_platform).

```hcl
after_hook "after_hook_plan" {
    # Windows does not support 'sh' commands, skip this step
    commands = get_platform() != "windows" ? ["plan"] : []
    execute  = ["sh", "-c", "terraform show -json plan > plan.json"]
}
```

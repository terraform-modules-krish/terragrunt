# Unable to run Plan and Apply on different machines

**dotjim** commented *Jun 27, 2018*

Terragrunt appears to not support operation via Continuous Integration in the [Plan and Apply on different machines](https://www.terraform.io/guides/running-terraform-in-automation.html#plan-and-apply-on-different-machines) scenario described by Terraform.

Attempts to have Terragrunt `plan-all` commands produce a plan output file, that would later be used as an input file by `apply` in another CI phase (or possibly another machine) fail with `Error: error satisfying plugin requirements` as no plugins are seen to be installed.

I've attempted to address via the `TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR` environment variable, with the intention of having the plugin cache directory produced by the `plan-all` phase be part of the CI artifact that is subsequently used in the `apply` phase.  Results suggest Terragrunt might not fully support  `TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR`.

## Environment summary
Terragrunt project structure mirrors [Example infrastructure-live for Terragrunt](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example)
Tests below performed on Mac with Terragrunt v0.14.11 and Terraform v0.11.7

## Steps to reproduce 

```
$ rm -fr ~/.terragrunt/
$ export TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR="/development/plugin-cache"
$ mkdir $TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR
$ cd /development/infrastructure/<region>/<env>/
$ terragrunt plan-all -out=/development/tfplan -input=false --terragrunt-source /development/infrastructure-modules/
[...]
Plan: 3 to add, 2 to change, 2 to destroy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This plan was saved to: /development/tfplan
[...]
```

The above results in the expected plan file being produced, and `/development/plugin-cache` populated with relevant plugins.

However attempts to use the plan file produced fail, even from the same machine and working directory as above.  For example:

```
$ terragrunt apply -lock=true --terragrunt-source /development/infrastructure-modules/ /development/tfplan

## Notes / Observations

With the `TF_LOG=debug` environment variable set the above `$ terragrunt apply -lock=true --terragrunt-source /development/infrastructure-modules/ /development/tfplan` command includes the below output, that suggests `terragrunt apply` does not utilize `TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR` and instead continues to look in `.terraform/plugins/`

```

`--terragrunt-source` is used in both `plan` and `apply` commands as automation seeks to guarantee the same contents is used by both phases and avoid performance penalties of downloading multiple times.

Although `plan-all` is used to produce the plan output file, it seems only `apply` supports a plan input file. Is this correct? A plan input file with `apply-all` results in:

```
You can't set variables with the '-var' or '-var-file' flag
when you're applying a plan file. The variables used when
the plan was created will be used. If you wish to use different
variable values, create a new plan file.
```

I've attempted various scenarios with `--terragrunt-non-interactive`, `-input=false` and `-auto-approve` type flags which have not influence the outcome above.

If I've missed something and there are other approaches for Terragrunt working in an automation / continuous integration world it would be great to have details included in the documentation.

There's definitely a bug with using plan files with Terragrunt and `extra_arguments`: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/493

I don't think we've ever tried `plan-all` and `apply-all` with plan files. The provider issue confuses me, as Terragrunt doesn't control where Terraform downloads provider/module code... It just runs `terraform init` and lets Terraform do its thing...

I recently set up a CI process using terragrunt plan-all and apply-all commands using the plan generated in a previous step.

My setup is:
- CircleCI
- Docker container with terraform, terragrunt, a 3rd party provider in `~/.terraform.d/plugins/`
- I am not using the `--terragrunt-source` switch.
- gcp remote storage for state.
- using a before_hook to generate a `myvars.auto.tfvars` file instead of using `extra_arguments`

Also I did notice that I needed to run the `apply-all` from the same absolute path as I ran the `plan-all` step from in the previous step.

I'm running into this same issue when using this type of setup with [Atlantis](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis)

@sjungwirth would you be open to sharing your before_hook code?
***

**sjungwirth** commented *Aug 16, 2018*

@mholttech sure, it's nothing too fancy:

```
#!/bin/bash

parent_dir=$1
relative_path=$2

child_dir="${parent_dir}/${relative_path}";

filename="${child_dir}/create_vars.auto.tfvars";
cat <<EOF > ${filename}
# DO NOT EDIT - File created by bin/create_vars.sh
dept = "${relative_path%/*}"
org_id = "XXXXXX"
billing_account = "XXXXXXXX"
EOF
```

and the root terragrunt config in /terraform.tfvars:
```
terragrunt = {
  remote_state {
    backend = "gcs"
    config {
      bucket  = "XXXXXXX"
      prefix    = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
      project = "XXXXXXX"
    }
  }

  terraform {
    before_hook "setup_vars" {
      commands = ["${get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars()}"]
      execute = [
        "${get_parent_tfvars_dir()}/bin/create_vars.sh", "${get_parent_tfvars_dir()}", "${path_relative_to_include()}",
      ]
      run_on_error = false
    }
  }
}
```

One thing I think I forgot to mention in my previous post, I needed to run `terragrunt validate-all ... || true` in my CI to initialize the `create_vars.auto.tfvars` files before trying to do a `plan-all`. The ` || true` part was to allow my CI to continue even though the `validate-all` command would return an error code.

@mholttech mholttech I know it's a little bit old issue, but I'm curious if you've ever solved this issue.

I'm unable to run `terragrunt plan-all -out=$PLANFILE` and then `terragrunt apply-all $PLANFILE` sequentially, terraform is complaining about unsatisfied plugins.. :(

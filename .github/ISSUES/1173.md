Very minor issue but one of the lines in the help output isn't lined up correctly: `terragrunt-parallelism <N> ...`

terragrunt --help
DESCRIPTION:
   terragrunt - Terragrunt is a thin wrapper for Terraform that provides extra tools for working with multiple
   Terraform modules, remote state, and locking. For documentation, see https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/.

USAGE:
   terragrunt <COMMAND>

COMMANDS:
   plan-all             Display the plans of a 'stack' by running 'terragrunt plan' in each subfolder
   apply-all            Apply a 'stack' by running 'terragrunt apply' in each subfolder
   output-all           Display the outputs of a 'stack' by running 'terragrunt output' in each subfolder
   destroy-all          Destroy a 'stack' by running 'terragrunt destroy' in each subfolder
   validate-all         Validate 'stack' by running 'terragrunt validate' in each subfolder
   terragrunt-info      Emits limited terragrunt state on stdout and exits
   graph-dependencies   Prints the terragrunt dependency graph to stdout
   hclfmt               Recursively find terragrunt.hcl files and rewrite them into a canonical format.
   *                    Terragrunt forwards all other commands directly to Terraform

   terragrunt-tfpath                            Path to the Terraform binary. Default is terraform (on PATH).
   terragrunt-no-auto-init                      Don't automatically run 'terraform init' during other terragrunt commands. You must run 'terragrunt init' manually.

   terragrunt-working-dir                       The path to the Terraform templates. Default is current directory.
   terragrunt-download-dir                      The path where to download Terraform code. Default is .terragrunt-cache in the working directory.
   terragrunt-source                            Download Terraform configurations from the specified source into a temporary folder, and run Terraform in that temporary folder.

   terragrunt-iam-role                          Assume the specified IAM role before executing Terraform. Can also be set via the TERRAGRUNT_IAM_ROLE environment variable.
   terragrunt-ignore-dependency-errors          *-all commands continue processing components even if a dependency fails.
   terragrunt-ignore-dependency-order           *-all commands will be run disregarding the dependencies
   terragrunt-ignore-external-dependencies      *-all commands will not attempt to include external dependencies
   terragrunt-include-external-dependencies     *-all commands will include external dependencies
   terragrunt-parallelism <N>          *-all commands parallelism set to at most N modules
   terragrunt-exclude-dir                       Unix-style glob of directories to exclude when running *-all commands

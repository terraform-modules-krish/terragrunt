# Terragrunt Dependency: Backend initialization required, please run "terraform init"

**gongjunhuang** commented *Jul 30, 2021*

Using **dependency** in Terragrunt:

```
 dependency "image" {
   config_path = "../image_copy"
 }
```

it's working before but not working right now, throwing the error:
```
Error: Backend initialization required, please run "terraform init"
Reason: Initial configuration of the requested backend "oss"
The "backend" is the interface that Terraform uses to store state,
perform operations, etc. If this message is showing up, it means that the
Terraform configuration you're using is using a custom configuration for
the Terraform backend.

Changes to backend configurations require reinitialization. This allows
Terraform to set up the new configuration, copy existing state, etc. Please
run
"terraform init" with either the "-reconfigure" or "-migrate-state" flags
to use the current configuration.

If the change reason above is incorrect, please verify your configuration
hasn't changed and try again. At this point, no changes to your existing
configuration or state have been made.

```

remote_state {
    backend = "oss"

    }

I deleted the old tfstate files, and I can run the terrragrunt code once, but the second the time I ran the terragrunt apply command, the **Error: Backend initialization required, please run "terraform init"** error happens again.

What commands are you running? In which folders? Could you share the whole folder structure? And the full log output?

Closing this as stale. If this is still an issue, please update with the relevant context and happy to help/reopen. Thanks!

I'm having a very similar problem and this is the only example on the entire internet of anyone else having this same issue

Try deleting the cache in all dependencies. In my case the cache became corrupt because I switched to a branch that didn't have the terragrunt cache listed in .gitignore thus I had to unstage and remove the files before switching back.

if you're using AWS SSO for your aws credentials in your local, I guess you need to refresh the aws creds env vars

Yeah, I am running into this on one directory only so strange. Have you found a solution?
***

**phatcher** commented *Jun 27, 2022*

I had this recently and it was a external with an old .terraform folder that was out of sync with the lock.hcl, so check for any cache files that you may have forgotten to delete

I'm having the same issue as well, and it's only on one directory.

Hi
I am also seeing this issue intermittently;
I can successfully run the `init -reconfigure` command once and then same issue;
My environment is a Debian container (with terreagrunt) running on Windows and WSL2 and Docker Desktop.

When running in debug mode, I see this message from TG that the backend configuration of the dependency is generated in, for example, /tmp/2723232323/backend.tf; 
However, when I check /tmp, there is no such backend file.

Could this be related to WSL File System driver?

I tested this both on /tmp (as a container internal path) and also on a mounted volume. Both with same error.

----
Update:
I was using environment variables to set TF_DATA_DIR and TERRAGRUNT_DOWNLOAD to custom locations.
I removed these environment variables to let the Terregrunt work inside the module and it started working; Not sure if this is a temporary fix or permanent.

Hi @yorinasub17 and @brikis98 
Can you please reopen and investigate?
***

**denis256** commented *Aug 26, 2022*

Hi,
on which state backend this is happening? on `oss` or `s3`?
***

**ksaffarian** commented *Aug 26, 2022*

For me, this is on azurerm backend.
***

**mesgme** commented *Sep 14, 2022*

Same issue azurerm backend

***

**ThaSami** commented *Sep 29, 2022*

same issue here with S3 remote state when running terragrunt init/plan inside one module 
however it worked fine when running `terragrunt run-all plan` in the root folder
***

**drafie** commented *Dec 20, 2022*

I am experiencing the same issue - Backend initialization required, please run "terraform init".

Using this command cleaned up the problem for me:

`terragrunt run-all plan --terragrunt-source-update`
***

**devurandom** commented *Dec 20, 2022*

In case it helps someone else: In my case, using `terragrunt plan --terragrunt-log-level=debug`, I figured out that a provider was using expired credentials.

**MishaZaharyak** commented *Jul 20, 2023*

I have the same issue with S3 remote state when running `terragrunt init/plan`. 
I start googling this and found this issue.

here is my config (parent `terragrunt.hcl`) that didn't work for me

```terraform
skip = true

locals {
  common_vars = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("common.hcl"))
  env_vars    = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("env.hcl"))
  ...
}

remote_state {
  backend      = "s3"
  generate     = {
	path      = "_backend.tf"
	if_exists = "overwrite"
  }
  config       = {
	encrypt = true
	bucket  = local.remote_state_bucket_name
	key     = "${local.project_name}/${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
	profile = local.remote_state_config_profile
	region  = local.remote_state_config_region
  }
  disable_init = true
}

generate "provider" {
  path      = "_provider.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite"
  contents  = <<EOF
provider "aws" {
  profile = "${local.provider_aws_profile}"
}

EOF
}
```

and generated file `_backend.tf` looks like this

```terraform
# Generated by Terragrunt. Sig: nIlQXj57tbuaRZEa
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket  = "bucket-name"
    encrypt = true
    key     = "my/key/path/terraform.tfstate"
    profile = "profile-name"
    region  = "eu-central-1"
  }
}
```

but when I used `generate` block for backend it did work, so
here is my new config (parent `terragrunt.hcl`) that works for me.

```terraform
skip = true

locals {
  common_vars = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("common.hcl"))
  env_vars    = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("env.hcl"))
  ...
}

generate "config" {
  path      = "_config.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite"
  contents  = <<EOF
provider "aws" {
	profile = "${local.provider_aws_profile}"
}

terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket  = "${local.remote_state_bucket_name}"
    encrypt = true
    key     = "${local.project_name}/${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
    region  = "${local.remote_state_config_region}"
    profile = "${local.remote_state_config_profile}"
  }
}

EOF
}
```

generated file `_config.tf`, as you can see the backend is the same

```terraform
# Generated by Terragrunt. Sig: nIlQXj57tbuaRZEa
provider "aws" {
    profile = "profile-name"
}

terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket  = "bucket-name"
    encrypt = true
    key     = "my/key/path/terraform.tfstate"
    profile = "profile-name"
    region  = "eu-central-1"
  }
}

```

but I do spot a difference in logs when execute command with `--terragrunt-log-level=debug`, so for config with 
`remote_state` log looks like this:

```shell
...
DEBU[0000] Generated file /home/blabla/path/terragrunt/env/dev/global/vpc/.terragrunt-cache/vBO-sc_vio3ivQczM09qg8Y5Sfc/bqKF5KAF8o8xpsJkMJdrec39gBw/_provider.tf.  prefix=[/home/blabla/path/terragrunt/env/dev/global/vpc] 
DEBU[0000] Generated file /home/blabla/path/terragrunt/env/dev/global/vpc/.terragrunt-cache/vBO-sc_vio3ivQczM09qg8Y5Sfc/bqKF5KAF8o8xpsJkMJdrec39gBw/_backend.tf.  prefix=[/home/blabla/path/terragrunt/env/dev/global/vpc] 
DEBU[0000] Running command: terraform init -backend=false  prefix=[/home/blabla/path/terragrunt/env/dev/global/vpc] 
...
```

and for config with `generated` block for backend it is next:

```shell
...
DEBU[0000] Generated file /home/blabla/path/terragrunt/env/dev/global/vpc/.terragrunt-cache/vBO-sc_vio3ivQczM09qg8Y5Sfc/bqKF5KAF8o8xpsJkMJdrec39gBw/_config.tf.  prefix=[/home/blabla/path/terragrunt/env/dev/global/vpc] 
DEBU[0000] Running command: terraform init               prefix=[/home/blabla/path/terragrunt/env/dev/global/vpc] 
...
```

so as you can see the first approach is executing `terraform init` with `-backend=false` 
argument. This is what docs say about this argument 

> -backend=false          
> 
>  Disable backend or Terraform Cloud initialization for this configuration and use what was previously initialized instead.

my terraform version is 

```shell
terraform -version

# Terraform v1.5.1
# on linux_amd64
# + provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws v5.8.0
# 
# Your version of Terraform is out of date! The latest version
# is 1.5.3. You can update by downloading from https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html
```

my terragrunt version is

```shell
terragrunt -version
# terragrunt version v0.48.1
```

Sorry, my problem was because of this directive in `remote_state` - `disable_init = true`, when I removed it everything went fine, so just my mistake

# Remote backend not handled when force_path_style enabled and bucket versioning disabled

**ChristophShyper** commented *Aug 9, 2019*

Steps to reproduce:
* have S3 bucket with versioning disabled
* set `force_path_style = true`

Behavior:
Following errors appears 
```
Remote state S3 bucket my-backend-bucket does not exist or you don't have permissions to access it. Would you like Terragrunt to create it? (y/n)

RequestError: send request failed caused by: Get https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/my-backend-bucket?versioning=: dial tcp: lookup s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com on 169.254.169.253:53: dial udp 169.254.169.253:53: connect: invalid argument

Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1
```

Expected behavior:
Throw error about versioning not enabled, like it was before.

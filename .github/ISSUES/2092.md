# Simple terragrunt import.. how?

**awitterackspace** commented *Apr 29, 2022*

Sorry for possibly repeating a question somewhere but I can't seem to find an answer for this:

I'm trying to simply import some state into my Terragrunt/Terraform project.  I have a terragrunt.hcl that points to a module folder for the Terraform repo.

_terragrunt.hcl_
```
terraform {
  source = "/../../../..//modules/environment"
}
```

To confirm the resource name I want to import I run a plan:

_terragrunt plan_
```
  # confluentcloud_environment.environment[0] will be created
  + resource "confluentcloud_environment" "environment" {
      + display_name = "dev"
      + id           = (known after apply)
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
```

Now when I try to run an import:
`terragrunt import 'confluentcloud_environment.enviroment[0]' env-299n2 `

Terraform informs me that I have not created the resource block for this anywhere. 
```
Before importing this resource, please create its configuration in the root module. For example:

resource "confluentcloud_environment" "enviroment" {
  # (resource arguments)
}
```

I haven't declared a resource {} for this anywhere outside the environment module.  Surely I'm doing something wrong, just curious what it is.  Thanks!

Using relative paths for `terraform.source` are known to be sensitive to the working directory, so it's possible it is pointing to the wrong source. You can verify this by running `terragrunt` in [debug mode](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/debugging/) to identify the terraform working directory and introspecting what is in there.

If it turns out to be a path issue, you can make it more robust with [get_terragrunt_dir](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/built-in-functions/#get_terragrunt_dir):

```
terraform {
  source = "${get_terragrunt_dir()}/../../../..//modules/environment"
}
```

Thanks @yorinasub17 for the quick response.  So I tried of a bunch of things and I think what fixed it was deleting the contents of the .terragrunt-cache folder.  My initial terraform.source blocks (unchanged) now imports correctly.  Interesting.  Thanks again.

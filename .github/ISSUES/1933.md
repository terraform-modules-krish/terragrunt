# Allow setting terragrunt cli options in terragrunt.hcl 

**john-delivuk** commented *Nov 26, 2021*

We have sections where we know running `run-all plan` without `--terragrunt-parallelism` could have fatal consequences. It would be great if I could set terragrunt cli options in our `terragrunt.hcl` config file to add a safe default. Sorry if this is a known feature. I spend some time reviewing docs and issues, and was unable to find any info pertaining to this.

Hmm I'm not sure this would make intuitive sense to put in a `terragrunt.hcl` config, since `terragrunt.hcl` is typically a local scoped configuration, while `--terragrunt-parallelism` is a global scope configuration.

I think what is necessary here would be a `.terragruntrc` file, similar to [.terraformrc](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/config/config-file.html), which we don't currently have, but seems useful.

# creating multiple SQS and DeadLetterQueue with iam role and policy required using terragrunt

**drey0143143** commented *Oct 14, 2021*

I am having some issue with my terragrunt configuration and main.tf configuration…I am trying to call my main.tf to use its configuration to create SQS and other resources in different environment but it wont create the SQS,DeadletterQueue ,role and the required policy in my desired environment.please what I’m i doing wrong.Below is the configuration that I have in my terragrunt and main.tf that I am trying to call.Also how do i pass the resource section of the policy as variable because those will be different based on environment.


Terragrunt.hcl

~~~
terraform {
         source = "../../../../..//module"
}


~~~ include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

inputs = {
  event_log_bucket_name = "trailbucket-sqs-logs"
  aws_sqs_queue_name               = "Trail_SQS"
  dead_letter_queue_name           = "Trail_SQS_DLQ"
  role_name                        = "ronix_access_role"
  description                      = "Role for ronix access"
  kms_key_arn                      = "ARN of the key"
}
}

main.tf

Are you trying to use a single `terragrunt.hcl` config to create the resources from the terraform module in different environments? If so, that doesn't quite work because the state file will be pointing to the same location.

You need to create multiple terragrunt.hcl configurations for each environment you want to create, in a folder tree.

yes I am trying to use a single terragrunt.hcl config to create the resources from the terraform module in different environments

I need to create 2 SQS and 2 DeadLetterQueue with different names within an environment for example(production),any suggestion how I can get that done please?the reason for that is I need one Queue for my cloudtrail data event logs and the other for my management data event logs.

Terragrunt doesn't support calling a single module multiple times from a single configuration. If you need to create multiple queues, you need to implement that in the terraform side (using `for_each` on the input parameters), or have two `terragrunt.hcl` configurations.

Thanks @yorinasub17 ,How will I use for_each to create 2 queues with different names simultaneously
***

**yorinasub17** commented *Oct 14, 2021*

Take a look at https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/meta-arguments/for_each.html

Thank you

**drey0143143** commented *Oct 14, 2021*

If I use for_each as you suggested in the terraform side does that mean I would have to alter the name of the queue input in my terragrunt.hcl configuration?

Yes

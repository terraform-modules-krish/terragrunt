# [Question] Fresh homebrew installations of terragrunt and terraform on macOS show unexpected incompatibility

**ringohoffman** commented *Nov 1, 2022*

Just followed the installation instructions for [`terragrunt`](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/getting-started/install/#install-via-a-package-manager) and [`terraform`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads), and got a strange error message about incompatibility:

```sh
$ terraform --version
Terraform v1.3.3
on darwin_amd64

$ terragrunt --version
terragrunt version v0.39.2

$ terragrunt plan
ERRO[0002] The currently installed version of Terraform (1.3.3) is not compatible with the version Terragrunt requires (= v0.15.0). 
ERRO[0002] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1 
```

This doesn't really track with the [compatibility table](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/getting-started/supported-terraform-versions/), even though `1.3.x`/`0.39.x` aren't listed. Anything I'm missing here?

# Caching STS Credentials with IAM Role

**qrevel** commented *Oct 21, 2017*

Hi,

First of all, the support of IAM Role is really usefull.
I'm currently on a very low internet connection and it seems that each time I execute a command, terragrunt ask for new credentials.
Is it possible to cache credentials given by the first sts assume-role?
Therefore we only update credentials when needed.

Thanks

I'm having trouble understanding what a slow internet connection has to do with credentials. Where does Terragrunt ask for credentials? How are you currently providing your credentials (env var, profile, IAM role, etc)?

I'm providing an IAM Role as a credentials, Terragrunt then assume the role as expected:
```
[terragrunt] 2017/10/21 12:02:06 Assuming IAM role arn:aws:iam::XXX:role/Administrators
```
The problem is this step takes a long time (5s) to complete on every terragrunt command.
I suppose it's my internet connection but it maybe something else.

Ah, I see. Yes, if your Internet is slow, assuming an IAM role will take some time. There is no obvious & secure way for Terragrunt to cache those credentials. The best you can do is to install the AWS CLI, call [aws sts assume-role](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sts/assume-role.html), and set the credentials you get back as environment variables. Those creds are good for ~1 hour and Terragrunt/Terraform will use them automatically.

unless you are using MFA, which makes them only 5 min :D  

I would recommend aws-vault over aws cli since it does manage roles much easier and tokens arent saved in clear text

No, I'm pretty sure it's still 1 hour, even with MFA.

AFAIK, aws-vault calls assume role for every single command, so it'll be no faster than asking Terragrunt to assume that role. That said, yes, aws-vault is a good tool for secret storage.

i use mfa on all my accounts, and daily on aws cli and terraform.
it's sadly (?) much less than one hour :(

We use MFA for all accounts too. It's always been an hour for us. See the `--duration-seconds` parameter here: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sts/assume-role.html

thanks for pointing out that resource, will have a look.
will be useful for when deploying RDS which always times out with terraform/terragrunt :D

I believe the original question has been answered, so closing

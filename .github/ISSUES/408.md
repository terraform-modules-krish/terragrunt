# Use XDG directories for cache

**qrevel** commented *Jan 26, 2018*

Hi,

#340 implemented cache at `$HOME/.terragrunt`.

Is it possible to use `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/terragrunt` as the initial issue (#334) suggests it?

Thanks

Sorry, I'm a bit ignorant on what `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` is and what advantages there are of using it over `$HOME`?

Follow [XDG standards specification](https://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) could be one advantage. You can remove your `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` without risking to lose any important data and  it avoids cluttering your `$HOME` directory.. I don't everything about it but some project (neovim, tmuxinator...) are using these standards.

Hm, it doesn't look like `$XDG_DATA_HOME` is all that ubiquitous (e.g., what OS's have it set by default?), so if we made this change, we'd have to check for the existence of `$XDG_DATA_HOME` first, and if it's not set, fall back to `$HOME`. I'd be OK with this small bit of extra complexity assuming this is actually a popular standard?

It's true not all OS's set `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` by default so existence should be checked.

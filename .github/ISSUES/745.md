# terragrunt S3 backend permission error when using from another aws account

**truptiak** commented *Jun 13, 2019*

I am using two accounts as MainAWS account & TestAWS account. We have created the bucket in MainAWS account as "xxxxxbucket". Also created dynamodb table as "tf-state-lock" with LockID.

Created the below structure to use my module with terragrunt & keep my remote backend config DRY -

# Include all settings from the root terraform.tfvars file

Attached below bucket level policy to the bucket in MainAWS account -

{

            },
            "Action": "s3:ListBucket",

            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::accountID:user/terraform"

            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::xxxxxbucket/tfstate"
        }
    ]
}

Now when finally I am running the terragrunt command,it's showing access denied error as below -

terragrunt-vpc-example/non-prod/us-east-1/vpc] 2019/06/13 04:09:14 Initializing remote state for the s3 backend
[terragrunt] 2019/06/13 04:09:14 AccessDenied: Access Denied
        status code: 403, request id: 7A56E5635D767A4A, host id: m1cKlNOEnB3X8Jd7gscjg6IS9hr4EEsX36J2/qLb0NDOWL+Uygt1TtuYoBnUj7srCOl0iMu9dF4=
[terragrunt] 2019/06/13 04:09:14 Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1

1. With aws cli I can upload/download to the bucket.
2. When I am using the bucket from same account as TestAWS,its working fine.I have to change just bucket name.

3. Without terragrunt, I can able to use the s3 from MainAWS account as backend.

Is there anything which need to be added to my setup to make it working ?

What version of Terragrunt are you using?
***

**truptiak** commented *Jun 17, 2019*

I am using terragrunt version v0.18.7.

Could you fix the syntax highlighting on your code? It's hard to read it without any. You need to wrap each code block with three backticks: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

Are you sure you're using the same bucket name when testing with the `aws` CLI and in your `terraform.tfvars`? What commands are you running? How are you authenticating?

I think the issue is in the [checkIfVersioningEnabled](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/remote/remote_state_s3.go#L325) function that calls the s3.GetBucketVersioningInput function.
It looks like only the bucket owner can call that [API function](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketGETversioningStatus.html
):

```

GET Bucket versioning
Description
This implementation of the GET operation uses the versioning subresource to return the versioning state of a bucket. To retrieve the versioning state of a bucket, you must be the bucket owner.

```

A quick fix for this would be to use the skip_bucket_versioning flag and avoid calling checkIfVersioningEnabled if it is set to false. 

If that's an accepted solution, I can provide a PR.

@mattiarossi @brikis98 I seem to be hitting this same problem.  I'm also trying to use a bucket created by another user for S3 state, and I also fail on checkIfVersioningEnabled().  I don't understand why terragrunt fails when running terraform directly succeeds.  It is a massive stumbling block for us.  We really want to use terragrunt, but we're going to have to use a patched version to get over this issue.

Yes definitely should not do any versioning check if that flag is set to true. PR is very welcome for that change.

Hi, I have a patched 0.18 version available here: https://github.com/mattiarossi/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.18.9
It is the latest v0.18.8 plus the skip_bucket_versioning check and the ability to use a local dynamodb endpoint
Will provide a PR for the master branch of terragrunt soon

@mattiarossi Thanks, I'll hold off on putting up a PR.

**mattiarossi** commented *Sep 23, 2019*

@eamonnotoole PR has been created: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/874

**brikis98** commented *Sep 24, 2019*

Should be fixed in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.19.26

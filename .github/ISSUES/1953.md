# two includes with path_relative_to_include functions

**suppix** commented *Dec 17, 2021*

Hello.  Am I right that I can't use path_relative_to_include inside include block like this ?

```HCL
include "root" {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

include "envcommon" {
  path = "${dirname(find_in_parent_folders())}/_envcommon/${path_relative_to_include("root")}/terragrunt.hcl"
}
```
<br />

Yes unfortunately, you can't use the include related functions within include blocks. This is a limitation of the parser.

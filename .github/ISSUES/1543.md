# BUG: Cannot run-all apply with plan file

**schlomo** commented *Feb 11, 2021*

I want to apply based on a plan. So first I run `terragrunt run-all plan -out tf.plan` which works and puts a `tf.plan` file into every module directory.

When I then try to run `terragrunt run-all apply tf.plan` it fails like this:
```bash
$ terragrunt run-all --terragrunt-non-interactive --terragrunt-log-level info apply tf.plan
INFO[0000] Stack at /home/schlomo/src/chromebooks-in-deutschland/aws/certificate:
  => Module /home/schlomo/src/chromebooks-in-deutschland/aws/certificate (excluded: false, dependencies: []) 
Are you sure you want to run 'terragrunt apply' in each folder of the stack described above? (y/n) INFO[0000] The non-interactive flag is set to true, so assuming 'yes' for all prompts

ERRO[0000] Encountered the following errors:
Hit multiple errors:
Hit multiple errors:
exit status 1 
```

The root cause seems to be the way how `terragrunt` calls `terraform`:
```
terraform apply tf.plan -input=false -auto-approve
```
which fails with
```
Too many command line arguments. Configuration path expected.
```
because `terraform` expects the plan file to be the **last** command line argument, given after all the options.

Am I doing something wrong here? My versions are:
```
terragrunt version v0.28.3
Terraform v0.14.6
```

We have the same issue at our side!

Looks like this part caused it to break:
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/commit/7b2e87569e0df31579fd304b35d540d3209f3f7a#diff-fbaccdaf1ea9f78ae69c6b3910b2508d9bc578801035a65c6d110fa6e717dd73R52

`-input=false` / `-auto-approve` are being appended at the end of the Terraform command while Terraform expects the plan file as the last argument.

I'm just astonished this passed testing.

As a workaround while waiting for a patch, I've reverted to 0.27.4 wherever I use this workflow.

Have a PR with a fix in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1544

We missed this because we generally discourage using `plan-all` especially with plan files due to the issues surrounding dependencies. If you want to know why, you can read through the warning at https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli-options/#plan-all-deprecated-use-run-all . With that said, this is something we do want to allow working so there is a new regression test in the PR to ensure it works going forward.

This happens also on 
`terragrunt run-all apply --terragrunt-parallelism 5 --terragrunt-non-interactive`
terragrunt version v0.28.2
Terraform v0.14.6

It's still asking for a confirmation: 
`Are you sure you want to run 'terragrunt apply' in each folder of the stack described above? (y/n)`

@jthenne Ah I think that is actually a logging issue. If you run with `--terragrunt-log-level info`, you should a log entry immediately following that that saids something along the lines of `Skipping interactive prompts due to running in non-interactive mode`.

**jthenne** commented *Feb 11, 2021*

It did break our CICD. 
I fixed it by adding `--terragrunt-log-level` as in:
`terragrunt run-all --terragrunt-non-interactive --terragrunt-source-update --terragrunt-parallelism 5 --terragrunt-log-level info apply`
***

**yorinasub17** commented *Feb 12, 2021*

Fix rolled out as https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.28.4 . Binaries should show up shortly.

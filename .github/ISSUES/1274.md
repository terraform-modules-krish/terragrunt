# before_hook with apply runs with terraform output command 

**wapmesquita** commented *Jul 31, 2020*

I have Module A with a `before_hook` with `apply` command. I have Module B which has a dependency on Module A.

The before_hook is executed when I deploy only the Module B, on the `terraform output` command to get the values from the Module A.

It appears that now hooks do not run at all when processing dependencies. Neither of the following configurations triggers a hook during the output gathering phase:

```
before_hook "workspace_select" {
    commands = ["plan", "apply", "destroy", "output"]
    execute  = ["/bin/bash", "-c", "terraform workspace select ${get_env("ENV")} || terraform workspace new ${get_env("ENV")}"]
}

after_hook "workspace_select" {
    commands = ["init"]
    execute  = ["/bin/bash", "-c", "terraform workspace select ${get_env("ENV")} || terraform workspace new ${get_env("ENV")}"]
}
```

Adding `disable_dependency_optimization = true` to the `remote_state` configuration block allows the hooks to run.

Yup this is a known limitation and documented under [the docs for dependency](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#dependency), section "Can I speed up dependency fetching?". Specifically (bold mine):

> However, terragrunt includes an optimization to only fetch the lowest level outputs (securitygroup and ecr in this example) provided that the following conditions are met in the immediate dependencies:
>   - The remote state is managed using remote_state blocks.
>   - The dependency optimization feature flag is enabled (disable_dependency_optimization = false, which is the default).
>   - The remote_state block itself does not depend on any dependency outputs (locals and include are ok).
>   - You are not relying on before_hook, after_hook, or extra_arguments to the terraform init call. **NOTE: terragrunt will not automatically detect this and you will need to explicitly opt out of the dependency optimization flag.**


The relevant issue for the underlying fix is https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1318

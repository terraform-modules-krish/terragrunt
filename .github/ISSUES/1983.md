# Revisit RFC decision not to implement `for_each` in light of terraform direction on dynamic providers.

**gtmtech** commented *Jan 16, 2022*

https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/24476 has a very detailed discussion (https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/24476#issuecomment-700368878)  by @apparentlymart in which he says there are several problems to implementing count and for_each on providers which cause some traps within terraform. As such he does not expect these to make it into any dynamic provider redesign whenever this is done. 

Terragrunt raised the incredibly useful idea of having `for_each` blocks within terragrunt to write static blocks over and over again with slightly different configurations. https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/rfc/for_each_iteration/

This is one of the most requested features by people who need to do any kind of multi-account, multi-region stuff. For example in my case, I have to terraform across around 200 aws accounts, in 4 different regions. Can you imagine having to define 800 static provider blocks? It's pretty awful.

It would seem that terragrunt's RFC proposal Option 2 would provide an amazing opportunity for some serious enterprise terraformers to have a solution in the space since it seems terraform itself is not doing one any time soon.

It also seemed that one of the reasons why Option 1 was decided on was that terraform was yet to release version 1.0, and had its own proposal of for_each and count in things like module blocks. Quite reasonably, this solution was waited for and you cite the reason for not proceeding with the RFC proposal as not wanting a solution in the space where terraform itself is going to imminently have a solution. Now this is all released however, it is palpably clear that terraform is deficient in the space for being able to generate dynamic providers and provider associations, and so very large scale terraformers are left to the mercy of creating their own wrapper scripts (or terraform orchestrators) to fill in this missing functionality. 

I wonder if therefore you would consider revisiting the RFC decision to help out. Many thanks

I think the terragrunt `generate` block is new since the rfc for_each was written... Have you tried using `generate` with `templatefile()` and a [templated file](https://www.terraform.io/language/expressions/strings#generating-json-or-yaml) to write the .tf or .tf.json that has all the modules and provider declarations?

I actually got it working, through a generate() block, containing a contents with a formatlist() directive, formatting a map as a provider block. 

I now have fully dynamic providers, and fully dynamic modules. 

Thanks for the suggestion.

If you want me to post the solution, please let me know, I haven't seen this documented _anywhere_ on the web yet.

Thanks for sharing @gtmtech!

My use-case is for configuring AKS clusters where the kubernetes provider needs to be passed the `config_path` argument pointing to the config file for the cluster. For each cluster then you need to create a separate provider.

Rather than a `formatlist` or `templatefile` I just used heredoc interpolation as shown in the example **`terragrunt.hcl`** below:

```hcl
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

dependency "aks" {
  config_path = "../aks"
}

generate "providers" {
  path = "provider_override.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  contents = <<-EOF
    terraform {
      required_providers {
        azurerm = {
          source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
          version = "2.93.1"
        }
        kubernetes = {
          source = "hashicorp/kubernetes"
          version = "2.7.1"
        }

      }
    }

    provider "azurerm" {
      features {}
    }

    %{ for name, cluster in dependency.aks.outputs.clusters }
    provider "kubernetes" {
      alias       = "${name}"
      config_path = "${cluster.kubeconfig}"
      experiments {
        manifest_resource = true
      }
    }
    %{ endfor }
  EOF
}
```

Since IIUC you can't use a variable to refer to a provider in a `providers` block, I had to also use `generate` to create the code to call the module as well.

It seems to work well if you create a cluster, ***however***, if you remove a cluster in the `aks` module the provider for that cluster never gets generated and terraform throws a missing provider error when applying to this module as it contains state originally created by the missing provider.

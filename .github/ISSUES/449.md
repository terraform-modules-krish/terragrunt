# "terragrunt plan" dumps tons of environment variables in its output now

**boldandbusted** commented *Mar 28, 2018*

Howdy. Just upgraded to 0.14.4 from 0.13.25. Now terragrunt dumps a large slice (all?) of my environment variables into the "map" sent to terraform, which is okay, (though I thought terraform only used the TF_VAR subset), but dumps it all to the console, too. How can I suppress this? Or have I found a bug? Or a feature? :)

```

Whoops, that's a bug. Left over print statement from development. Will fix shortly. Thanks for reporting!

OK, fix is in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.14.5. Binaries should show up in a few minutes.

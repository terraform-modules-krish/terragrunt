# Terragrunt ${path_relative_from_include()} not passing path to credentials correctly

**magiejen** commented *May 26, 2021*

Hello, I just started using terragrunt and hit a very weird bug. In the root `terragrunt.hcl`, I have this to set remote state
```
# Set the remote
remote_state {
  backend = "gcs"

  generate = {
    path      = "backend.tf"
    if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  }

  config = {
    prefix = path_relative_to_include()
    bucket = local.bucket_name
    credentials = "${path_relative_from_include()}/key.json"

    skip_bucket_creation = true
    project  = local.project_name
    location = "us"
  }
}
```
In the child `terragrunt.hcl', I have this
```
...
# Include all settings from the root terragrunt.hcl file
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}
```

Unless the credentials field is EXPLICITLY filled out, like `credentials = "/path/to/key/key.json"`, `terragrunt init` returns this error
```
Initializing modules...
Initializing the backend...
Error: storage.NewClient() failed: dialing: invalid character '.' looking for beginning of value
```

Is this a bug that other people have experienced or had success solving? Thank you so much!

Edit: find_in_parent_folders seems to solve the problem

# Terraform "-no-color" option not passed to terraform init

**mpkerr** commented *Dec 6, 2017*

In a command-line such as `terragrunt plan --terragrunt-source-update -no-color`
the -no-color argument does not get passed to the terraform init call, only to the terraform plan call.

Ah, interesting point. It's a bug, but a slightly tricky one, as when you run `plan` or other commands, only *some* of the arguments should get forwarded to `init`: e.g., `-no-color` should, but `-out=foo.plan` should not. So we'd probably need a whitelist of args that are safe to forward along...

PRs for fixing this are welcome!

There is a simple end-user workaround for this, and that is setting the `TF_CLI_ARGS` env variable to `-no-color`.
That particular flag _should be_ safe for passing to any terraform subcommand, but I have not tested that extensively yet.

Get this today as well, not big deal.

I think the solution proposed by @geekifier just suppresses any `terraform` output that is coloured (it does not set ALL coloured output to monochrome)

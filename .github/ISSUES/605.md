# How to reconfigure plugins

**chenrui333** commented *Nov 10, 2018*

Recently, I have problem with aws provider as [v1.43.1](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/issues/6416), I wonder if there is any command that I can use to reconfigure the plugins. 

```
Plugin reinitialization required. Please run "terraform init".
Reason: Could not satisfy plugin requirements.

Plugins are external binaries that Terraform uses to access and manipulate
resources. The configuration provided requires plugins which can't be located,
don't satisfy the version constraints, or are otherwise incompatible.

1 error(s) occurred:

* provider.aws: no suitable version installed
  version requirements: "<= 1.42.0"
  versions installed: "1.43.1"

Terraform automatically discovers provider requirements from your
configuration, including providers used in child modules. To see the
requirements and constraints from each module, run "terraform providers".
```
Thanks!

Hi @chenrui333 , you should be able to reinitialize the plugins by running `terragrunt init`.

yeah, I tried, but it does not work, the plugin version did not get updated. Is there any command option that I can use?

Hmm that is odd. That should update the provider to the specified version. Can you paste in the output of `terragrunt init`?

yeah, not quite working.
```
$ terragrunt init

Terraform initialized in an empty directory!

The directory has no Terraform configuration files. You may begin working
with Terraform immediately by creating Terraform configuration files.

Is that the root of your project, and you have subfolders from there with each defining a separate component ([the root folder in the `-all` command example](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt#the-apply-all-destroy-all-output-all-and-plan-all-commands))?

The reason I ask is that unfortunately, `terragrunt init` is one of those commands where we don't have a `-all` version so if you are running it at the root of your live infrastructures, then it will not work. It needs to be run in each individual component.

So I see two things happening here:

1. Somehow [Auto-Init](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt#auto-init) isn't detecting the provider change. This may be one of the cases we haven't handled yet.
2. We don't have a `-all` flavor of `init`, so you have to go into each subcomponent to make `terragrunt init` effective.

Yes, that is the root folder.

**chenrui333** commented *Nov 10, 2018*

Going to the module folder and doing `terragrunt init` solving the problem. It may be good that we can have some provider version change detection mechanism.

Also, feel free to close the issue as it works for me now.

**yorinasub17** commented *Nov 10, 2018*

Great to hear it is working now!

FYI I filed https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/606 to track the AutoInit detection.

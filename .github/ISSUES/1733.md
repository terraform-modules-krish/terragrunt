# Unsupported attribute; This object does not have an attribute named "outputs"

Hey
I am facing issues while adding a new dependency variable in the existing dependency block. `mock_outputs` fails as there is already some output, so didn't pass the mock value for the new dependency. 

```
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

dependency "common_lb" {
  config_path = "../common1"
  mock_outputs = {
    lb_dns = "sample_dns"
    lb_dns2 = "sample_dns" # inserted after successful terragrunt apply
  }
  # for tf validate
  mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands = ["init", "validate", "plan"]
  
}


inputs = {
  common_lb_dns = dependency.common_lb.outputs.lb_dns
  common_lb_dns2 = dependency.common_lb.outputs.lb_dns2 # inserted after successful terragrunt apply
}
```
am I missing some configurations? If I add `skip_output=true`, am getting 

` Unsupported attribute; This object does not have an attribute named "outputs"., and 1 other diagnostic(s)`

This is a dup of https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/940 . You can read the responses on that issue for the details on why mock outputs works this way. You can also follow that issue to be notified when we implement a feature/workaround for this use case.

Closing as dup.

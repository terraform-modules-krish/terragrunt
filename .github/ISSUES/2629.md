# AWS profile configuration for remote_state wrong

**flokli** commented *Jul 4, 2023*

**Describe the bug**
I want to use the `remote_state` block in terragrunt to describe remote state.

 - State is in AWS, the `default` profile has access to the state bucket
 - Other resources are in another profile, for which I configure the `provider` explicitly (see snippets below)
 - There's a `.envrc` file setting `AWS_PROFILE` to `foo`, so using awscli commands inside that directory uses the "target AWS profile", not the default one.

I run `tg init` and get an error message:

```
╷
│ Error: Failed to load state: AccessDenied: Access Denied
│ 	status code: 403, request id: 07YCJEJH7YT0CB64, host id: wm4TzxYLPzxQZwNeMmWYbxcyNHfTw/oZO10guAhyUbVz37tQlthcksbvfV+5PCgixgqVS3/XU9E=
```

I peeked a bit, it looks like terragrunt tries to access the state bucket with the credentials in the `foo` profile, not the `default` profile, even though it's configured like that in the `remote_state` block. I would assume `AWS_PROFILE` env var set to not matter.

If I stop setting `AWS_PROFILE`, the error message doesn't appear.


**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior, code snippets and examples which can be used to reproduce the issue.

```shell
export AWS_PROFILE=foo
```

```hcl
# provider.tf
provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-central-1"
  profile = "foo"
}
```

```hcl
# terragrunt.hcl
remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  generate = {
    path = "backend.tf"
    if_exists = "overwrite"
  }

  disable_init = true
  
  config = {
    encrypt        = true
    profile        = "default"
    bucket         = "some-remote-state-bucket"
    key            = "some-key.tfstate"
    dynamodb_table = "some-dynamodb"
    region         = "eu-central-1"

    disable_bucket_update = true
  }
```

**Expected behavior**
I'd expect `profile` being set to have precedence over `AWS_PROFILE` env var, to match how terraform itself behaves.

**Versions**
- Terragrunt version: v0.48.0
- Terraform version: v1.5.2
- Environment details (Ubuntu 20.04, Windows 10, etc.): NixOS Unstable

**Additional context**
+ provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws v4.64.0

Maybe the same issue as https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/2144.

I'm sorry, it seems like this was another remote state, which was used as a dependency that ambiently picked up the profile from `AWS_PROFILE`. Hardcoding it to the profile it should be using (and massaging `some .terraform` directories out of the way) worked.

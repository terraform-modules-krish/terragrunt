# apply/apply-all with a terraform plan file failing

**mpkerr** commented *Nov 1, 2018*

In both 0.16.14 and 0.17.1 I am still seeing a problem with the terraform command including -var-file options, even though this problem is claimed to be fixed.

Terraform initialized in an empty directory!

The directory has no Terraform configuration files. You may begin working
with Terraform immediately by creating Terraform configuration files.

You can't set variables with the '-var' or '-var-file' flag
when you're applying a plan file. The variables used when
the plan was created will be used. If you wish to use different
variable values, create a new plan file.

There has been some movements on improving things, but there are still a few issues with using plan files as documented in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/983. Will close this in favor of that ticket.

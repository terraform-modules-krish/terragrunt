# How to commit terraform.lock.hcl during GitHub Actions workflow run

**drey0143143** commented *Apr 7, 2022*

I want to push terraform.lock.hcl to my repo during GitHub Actions workflow run but I am getting error message "Error: fatal: pathspec '.terraform.lock.hcl' did not match any files". Below is my code snippet

~~~
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master

steps:
      - name: 'Checkout'
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

- name: Terragrunt Init
        id: init
        run: terragrunt run-all init -no-color --terragrunt-non-interactive

      - name: Terragrunt Validate
        id: validate
        run: terragrunt run-all validate -no-color --terragrunt-non-interactive

      - name: Commit lock file
        uses: EndBug/add-and-commit@v9
        with:
          add: ".terraform.lock.hcl"
          default_author: github_actor
          message: "Persisting lock file"
          push: true

Hi,
from the description is not clear directory structure of project and where `terragrunt.hcl` is located, usually, `.terraform.lock.hcl` is created in the same folder with `terragrunt.hcl`

# Test failures on master

I'm getting the following error when running this test:

```

Haven't investigated it at all, so can't tell you what the problem is.

Hmph, the tests _just_ passed in CircleCi, so there must be some bug in the test code that is triggered by environmental differences :-\

**kevinburkeotto** commented *Nov 10, 2017*

The first test that's failing is this one:

```
		{
			"${find_in_parent_folders()}",
			nil,
			options.TerragruntOptions{TerragruntConfigPath: "../test/fixture-parent-folders/no-terragrunt-in-root/child/sub-child/" + DefaultTerragruntConfigPath, NonInteractive: true},
			"",
			ParentFileNotFound{},
		},
```

This is what it finds (successfully):

```
$ go test -count=1 github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/config -run TestResolveTerragruntInterpolation
matches [${find_in_parent_folders()} find_in_parent_folders ]

Ohhh... Is it possible you just happen to have a `.terragrunt` file in some parent folder of where Terragrunt is checked out? If so, the test may unintentionally be finding it :)
***

**kevinburkeotto** commented *Nov 10, 2017*

I have a `.terragrunt` directory in /Users/kevin and a source code checkout in `/Users/kevin/src/github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt`, which seems like it's a pretty common occurrence? 
***

**brikis98** commented *Nov 10, 2017*

Indeed. Looks like that test needs to copy the code into some tmp folder or other location where the root won't contain a `.terragrunt` or `terraform.tfvars` file.
***

**kevinburkeotto** commented *Nov 10, 2017*

I am not sure it's the best solution, as that still leaves open the possibility of recursing to a parent folder that contains a `.terragrunt` directory. I don't think tests should rely at all on the state of the contents of folders above them in the directory hierarchy.
***

**brikis98** commented *Nov 10, 2017*

Ah, there is a simpler alternative.

Right now, the `find_in_parent_folders` helper traverses up the directory tree, up to `MAX_PARENT_FOLDERS_TO_CHECK` folders. This is a constant, but we could make it a variable defined in `TerragruntOptions`. We can then set it to a low number at test time to ensure it doesn't go beyond the fixtures folder.

This would make the tests fail in a different way, they currently check for ParentFileNotFound, but they'd need to check for CheckedTooManyParentFolders instead.
***

**brikis98** commented *Nov 10, 2017*

True. I think it's totally fine to return `ParentFileNotFound` there and add a `Cause` field to it that, there, get set to "too many parent folders".
***

**kevinburkeotto** commented *Nov 10, 2017*

another workaround would be to respect my XDG_CACHE_HOME setting (see https://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html for details) and write to `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/terragrunt`, or to write to `~/Library/Caches/terragrunt`, neither of which are parents of my source code directory
***

**brikis98** commented *Nov 11, 2017*

I think any folder we happen to use has a chance of having some `.terragrunt` or `terraform.tfvars` file above it. It seems like improving the error handling is a more robust fix.

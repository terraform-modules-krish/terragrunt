# Feature request - Add `-auto-approve` switch if we encountered a retryable error

**tiwood** commented *Jul 8, 2021*

If Terragrunt decides the encountered Terraform error is retryable, it should automatically add `-auto-approve` to the `TerraformCliArgs`, because we already approved the original plan.

Maybe we can make this optional with something like:

* `retry_auto_approve = true`
* `TERRAGRUNT_AUTO_RETRY_AUTO_APPROVE = 1`
<br />

That seems reasonable to me. We are a bit buried with other initiatives and are unlikely to implement this ourselves, so a PR to add it is very welcome!

# Plan only on changed modules

**monegim** commented *Sep 24, 2023*

According to the docs, when the command
```
terragrunt run-all plan
```
is applied, 
>  This will recursively search the current working directory for any folders that contain Terragrunt modules and run `plan` in each one, concurrently, while respecting ordering defined via [dependency](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#dependency) and [dependencies](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#dependencies) blocks.
**Describe alternatives you've considered**


As `plan` on large infrastructures could be costly, Is there a way to plan only on the changed modules.

As far as I know the best way is outlined in this document.

https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/keep-your-terragrunt-architecture-dry/#considerations-for-cicd-pipelines

You'd use git-diff to collect all changed files in a PR, and run terragrunt plan on each one using -terragrunt-config in a CI script.

I'd love for this kind of "change detection" to be incorporated into terragrunt itself. Something based on a "git committish", e.g. `git diff --name-only {{ COMMITISH }}`. A commitish is something like `1.0.0...HEAD`, and when passed to `git diff --name-only`, would list all the files changed between the branch HEAD and the 1.0.0 ref/tag. Terragrunt would then have some logic to walk the dependency tree and note which "included" working-dirs would be impacted by any of those changed files and filter in only those things impacted (or filter out and exclude, depending on perspective)...

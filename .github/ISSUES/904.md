# terragrunt plan-all is flakey from 0.19.25

**dvulpe** commented *Oct 9, 2019*

Hi 

We recently noticed that terragrunt plan-all is flakey and would randomly fail with files not found errors, sometimes reporting that a terraform backend hasn't been configured, despite being configured correctly:
```
.terragrunt-cache/yZpa9oXGPFA9yBeYJLKvMDWHQLA/nOHeCNZgRObX4kF5VK1jboCrx_w/.terragrunt-module-manifest: no such file or directory
```

I wrote a test to reproduce the problem and if the subtest runs 100 times I get to reproduce the problem at least twice (this can be run in `integration_test.go` on the master branch):

```
func TestDependencyPlanAllFlake(t *testing.T) {

	cleanupTerraformFolder(t, TEST_FIXTURE_GET_OUTPUT)
	tmpEnvPath := copyEnvironment(t, TEST_FIXTURE_GET_OUTPUT)
	rootPath := util.JoinPath(tmpEnvPath, TEST_FIXTURE_GET_OUTPUT, "localstate", "live")

	stdout := bytes.Buffer{}
	stderr := bytes.Buffer{}
	err := runTerragruntCommand(
		t,
		fmt.Sprintf("terragrunt apply-all --terragrunt-non-interactive --terragrunt-working-dir %s", rootPath),
		&stdout,
		&stderr,
	)
	logBufferContentsLineByLine(t, stdout, "stdout")
	logBufferContentsLineByLine(t, stderr, "stderr")
	require.NoError(t, err)
	for i :=0; i<100; i++ {
		t.Run(fmt.Sprintf("take %d", i), func(t *testing.T) {
			stdout := bytes.Buffer{}
			stderr := bytes.Buffer{}
			err := runTerragruntCommand(
				t,
				fmt.Sprintf("terragrunt plan-all --terragrunt-non-interactive --terragrunt-working-dir %s", rootPath),
				&stdout,
				&stderr,
			)
			logBufferContentsLineByLine(t, stdout, "stdout")
			logBufferContentsLineByLine(t, stderr, "stderr")
			require.NoError(t, err)
		})
	}
}
```

The test output for the failed cases looks like:
```
            	            	Encountered the following errors:
            	            	open /var/folders/cf/nhvbzztn3yn08kfswy1rqkmh0000gn/T/terragrunt-test981814188/fixture-get-output/localstate/live/parent/.terragrunt-cache/yZpa9oXGPFA9yBeYJLKvMDWHQLA/nOHeCNZgRObX4kF5VK1jboCrx_w/.terragrunt-module-manifest: no such file or directory
```

We downgraded to 0.19.24 where it appears to be stable. 
Would it be possible to have a look and understand where the race condition is coming from, please?

@ekini Do you have any idea what could be causing this?

**ekini** commented *Oct 11, 2019*

I haven't been able to reproduce it so far. Will try to investigate more tomorrow.

I'm having the same problem as @dvulpe said, and on version **0.19.24** everything seems to work fine.

Example error output at the end of terragrunt **plan-all** command using Terragrunt 0.20.4 and Terraform v0.12.9:
```
[terragrunt] 2019/10/15 07:42:32 Encountered the following errors:

The commits in question must be here https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/866 as it's the only difference between 0.19.24 and 0.19.25.

However, I don't see anything wrong with it.

I still can't reproduce the issue. I've tried:
1. Fresh repo on Mac with the test `TestDependencyPlanAllFlake`. Even with 500 passes it succeeds.
2. Fresh repo in Docker. Also no issues.
I used Terraform v0.12.10 and 0.12.7.

Noticing the same issue. It's really intermittent 

terragrunt version v0.20.4
Terraform v0.12.12
OSX + Ubuntu

```

Hi, I decided to revert the problematic change for the time being. Can you see if that fixes the issue? I created an integration testing release for convenience: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.21.2-alpha.1
***

**dvulpe** commented *Oct 30, 2019*

Hi @yorinasub17 

I'll give the alpha version a go this week and let you know how it goes.

Thanks,
Dan

@dvulpe thanks! I would also appreciate it if you can give https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.21.2-alpha.2 (https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/937) a try as well. Unlike the previous fix which rolls back the change, this will do proper synchronization of the `terragrunt output` call (and cache the results) so that we can keep the original change that is causing problems. If this works, we will most likely go with this version of the fix.

@yorinasub17 ive been having flaky *-all (seemed particularly flaky with destroy-all and plan-all, but noticed it across apply-all as well) that seemed to be around having multiple modules depending on the same module (they all need to read its outputs). I have no idea if it's related to this issue, but I tested the latest alpha and so far the flakiness seems to be resolved.

**geota** commented *Oct 31, 2019*

this also resolved flaky gitlab CI/CD pipelines

example error from an apply-all in our terragrunt demo project ci/cd pipeline:

```

Released the latest alpha fix as `v0.21.2` (https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.21.2). Binaries will show up shortly. The original alpha releases will be deleted once the binaries for `v0.21.2` show up.

I will keep this open until I have confirmation that this fixes the root issue.
***

**dvulpe** commented *Nov 2, 2019*

Great work! 

I can confirm the latest release `v0.21.2` completely solves the flakiness we were experiencing with `plan-all`.

Thank you so much for fixing it!
***

**yorinasub17** commented *Nov 4, 2019*

Thanks for confirming! Will close this out.

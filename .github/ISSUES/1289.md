# terragrunt plan-all -terragrunt-non-interactive doesn't work as expected

**ibacalu** commented *Aug 6, 2020*

Example structure:
```
.
└─ Project
   ├─ project.hcl
   ├─ terragrunt.hcl
   └─ IAM
      ├─ Permissions
      |  └─ terragrunt.hcl
      └─ Service Accounts
         └─ my-sa
            └─ terragrunt.hcl
```
```hcl
#Project/IAM/Service Accounts/my-sa/terragrunt.hcl
[...]
locals {
  project = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("project.hcl"))
}

dependency "project" {
  config_path = local.project.locals.path
  mock_outputs = local.project.locals.outputs
  mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands = ["validate", "plan"]
}
[...]
}
```
Running
```sh
cd "Project/IAM/Service Accounts/my-sa"
terragrunt plan-all
[...]
# I am getting this prompt.
Terragrunt will make changes in ~/Project as well! (y/n)
# If I respond `y` it will obviously detect changes for dependency too.
[...]
```
However, running it non-interactive, it won't create plan for `~/Project`
```sh
cd "Project/IAM/Service Accounts/my-sa"
terragrunt plan-all --terragrunt-non-interactive
# This will act as if responding `n` to question.
```

Is this by-design or an issue?
Thank you!

This is by design, although it's not well documented in the reference. The flag you are looking for is [terragrunt-include-external-dependencies](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli-options/#terragrunt-include-external-dependencies).

I was suspecting that. Thank you!

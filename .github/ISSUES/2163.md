# Terragrunt Plan is not honoring mock_outputs with new Terraform resource azurerm_windows_function_app

**bdorplatt** commented *Jun 24, 2022*

Running a plan against the new **azurerm_windows_function_app** resource results in the error below and will not accept a mock output and continue. The exact same setup with the deprecated **azurerm_function_app** works as expected and honors the mock values. Based on the error details, it appears the new resource requires actually seeing what tier the service plan is on and it can't get that from a mock value. Both tests were performed using the new **azurerm_service_plan** resource for the app service plan.

Hi,
I suspect it is because of `mock_outputs_merge_strategy_with_state` value which can take `no_merge/shallow/deep_map_only` values, `true` works with legacy field `mock_outputs_merge_with_state`

Hello, 
I realize now that the sample code I pasted above was after a last ditch attempt to get this working. It, of course, errored out with * Include merge strategy true is unknown. Valid strategies are: no_merge, shallow, deep, deep_map_only"*

Using any of the newer options below results in  **Error: could not read new Service Plan to check tier Service Plan**
mock_outputs_merge_strategy_with_state  = "shallow"
mock_outputs_merge_strategy_with_state  = "no_merge"
mock_outputs_merge_strategy_with_state  = "deep_map_only"

Since the legacy field is now deprecated and the documentation is telling is to use mock_outputs_merge_strategy_with_state, it seems there may be a need to fix this with the new merge options.

I've update the issue above with the correct code.

Providing an update here. With further testing through an Issue on the Terraform side, we found that a plan does run successfully when using the resource ID of an existing App Service Plan (actual resource existing in Azure) entered as the mock output in the terragrunt.hcl of the Function app. For reference: [https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/issues/17376](url)

Since the whole point of mock outputs is to not have resources already existing, an adjustment to how Terragrunt handles this resource type will probably be needed.

While using a real ASP ID is a sort of workaround, it isn't sustainable since if the referenced App Service Plan is deleted, the code will be broken.  This also doesn't work if the app is being deployed in a new subscription or a subscription that doesn't have any App Service Plans deployed yet.

Is there a resource that can take a look at this?

**bargokr** commented *Sep 12, 2022*

We are having this issue as well - anyone have an update to this?

**ravick4u** commented *Oct 12, 2023*

Is this still an issue? Any workaround other then specifying the actual service plan?

**bdorplatt** commented *Oct 12, 2023*

We haven't found a workaround yet and occasionally have deployments fail as old ASP's referenced are decommissioned. We then have to reference another real service plan, unfortunately, to get things going again. 
We opened a more recent issue https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/2324 for this with more detail and it has been added to the [Terragrunt Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/gruntwork-io/projects/35) so hopefully it will be resolved in the near future.

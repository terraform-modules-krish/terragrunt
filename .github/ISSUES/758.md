# Using modules in a different git repo

**heydonovan** commented *Jun 19, 2019*

I'm new to Terragrunt, so maybe this is a huge oversight on my part:

```
$ pwd
/Users/heydonovan/projects/ztf/development

$ terragrunt plan-all --terragrunt-source ~/projects/terraform-modules/
```

```
$ cat terragrunt.hcl
remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    bucket         = "terraform-non-prod"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
    encrypt        = true
    key            = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
  }
}

inputs = {
  aws_region = "us-east-1"
}
```

This throws the error:

```
[terragrunt] 2019/06/19 11:46:32 Error with plan:
Error: Module source has changed

  on main.tf line 2, in module "eks":
   2:   source = "terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws"

The source address was changed since this module was installed. Run "terraform
init" to install all modules required by this configuration.

[terragrunt] 2019/06/19 11:46:32 Encountered the following errors:
Hit multiple errors:
exit status 1
```

Now, should I be running `terragrunt init-all`? Or navigating to the module repo and running `terraform init`? I've tried that, and of course it wants to know the S3 settings since it doesn't have any concept of it:

```
$ pwd
/Users/heydonovan/projects/terraform-modules/eks

$ terraform init

  Enter a value: ^C
```

```
$ cat init.tf
terraform {
  backend "s3" {}
  required_version = ">= 0.12.0"
}

provider "aws" {
  region = var.aws_region
}
```

How do other folks handle this?

Hi @heydonovan,

You should be able to run `terragrunt init` in the respective `live` folder that corresponds to the module that is failing.

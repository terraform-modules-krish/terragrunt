# include or reuse a "dependency" block?

**bitsofinfo** commented *Apr 5, 2021*

I'm trying to use the DRY principles expressed in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-modules-example and https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example

I am constantly having to re-declare `dependency` blocks in my `live` repo for low level dependencies such as outputs from an azure vnet module that I'm using.  How can I avoid re-declaring this over and over? 

the `include` block seems useful but I'm already using that with `find_in_parent_folders()`... and it only takes one `path` so I'm out of luck there. Perhaps `generate` in a top level `terragrunt.hcl` file but that won't work either, because i don't want this in all of my files, just a certain % of them.

```
dependency "vnet" {
  config_path = "../vnet"

  skip_outputs = true
  mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands = ["validate", "plan"]
  mock_outputs = {
    azurerm_resource_group = {
      name = "test-rg"
      location = "eastus"
    },
    azurerm_virtual_network = {
      name = "test-vnet"
      id = "/subscriptions/mock/resourceGroups/mock-rg/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/mock-vnet-001"
    },
    azurerm_nat_gateway = {
      id = "/subscriptions/mock/resourceGroups/mock-rg/providers/Microsoft.Network/natGateways/mock-nat-001"
    },
    non_bastion_subnet_ids = ["192.168.0.0/16"]
  }
}
```

This use case would be addressed in the imports enhancements proposed in this ticket: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1566

In that world, you should be able to leverage multi-level includes to achieve DRY of dependencies without breaking `run-all` (which `read_terragrunt_config` does - https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1128).

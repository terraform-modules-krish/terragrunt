# Respect `disable_checkpoint` flag from `.terraformrc` file.

**ina-stoyanova** commented *Jul 9, 2021*

Hey, a customer has asked whether we support this with terragrunt. I didn't find anywhere that we respect this file config or the `disable_checkpoint` flag itself. 

Is this something we want to support?

Context provided by the user:
```
disable_checkpoint — when set to true, disables upgrade and security bulletin checks that require reaching out to HashiCorp-provided network services.
```

and then the `.terraformrc` file:

```
cat ~/.terraformrc
plugin_cache_dir = "$HOME/.terraform.d/plugin-cache"
disable_checkpoint = true
```

with `terragrunt plan` running:
```
terragrunt plan

ty for opening this - this prevents us from operating in a closed network env

To workaround this - for now I am using the following settings

.terraformrc file
```    
    plugin_cache_dir = "$HOME/.terraform.d/plugin-cache" 
    disable_checkpoint = true
    provider_installation {
      filesystem_mirror {
        path    = "/home/tburow/.terraform.d/plugin-cache"
        include = ["registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/*"]
      }
    }
```
tree .terraform.d

This output is 100% from Terraform. I don't think Terragrunt is involved at all; it doesn't do anything with `.terraformrc` settings or provider downloads. 

Best way to validate is to remove Terragrunt from the equation temporarily and run `terraform init`. I'm guessing the error will be the same.

As you have it working now, perhaps the solution is to add that `provider_installation` block, as you've shown. Marking this issue as closed.

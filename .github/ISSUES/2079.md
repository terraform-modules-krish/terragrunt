# "locals" evaluation is not executed in parallel

**mattmessinger** commented *Apr 21, 2022*

When running `run-all` commands, the evaluation of `locals` sections in each `terragrunt.hcl` is executed serially.

Example following `stage` example from https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/getting-started/quick-start/#keep-your-backend-configuration-dry

```
stage
├── terragrunt.hcl
├── frontend-app
│   ├── main.tf
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
└── mysql
    ├── main.tf
    └── terragrunt.hcl
```

"frontend-app/terragrunt.hcl"
```
locals {
  echo  = run_cmd("echo", "frontend")
  sleep = run_cmd("sleep", "1")
}
```

"mysql/terragrunt.hcl"
```
locals {
  echo  = run_cmd("echo", "mysql")
  sleep = run_cmd("sleep", "2")
}
```

"terragrunt.hcl"
```
locals {
  echo  = run_cmd("echo", "root")
  sleep = run_cmd("sleep", "5")
}
```

Effective output (total time ~ 18 seconds)
```
root
<sleep 5 seconds>
frontend
<sleep 1 second>

root
<sleep 5 seconds>
mysql
<sleep 2 seconds>

root
<sleep 5 seconds>
```

If the `locals` evaluation was executed in parallel then the total output time should be approximately the sum of a the longest module, in this case 7 seconds.

hi,
may cause issues on existing HCL files which relayed on sequential evaluation of locals

@denis256 good point -- can it be added as an "opt-in" feature using a new CLI option?

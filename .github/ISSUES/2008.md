# Implement a mechanism for providing macro placeholders and substitutions

**erhudy** commented *Feb 1, 2022*

This is an issue to backfill an explanation for PR #2000, which I already created as a possible implementation.

The issue to be solved here is how to handle operations with `run-all` that might have side effects such as creating files. In my case, the specific issue to be solved is that I have a number of repositories in which several different `terragrunt.hcl` files are defined. Currently each `terragrunt.hcl` file spawns its own pipeline which must be executed individually. For reasons of auditing, the CI pipeline generates the plan in one stage and then that plan file is passed to the next stage to be applied. This is where the problem arises: if Terragrunt is executed with a command like `terragrunt run-all plan -out=plan.cache`, the plan file is written to some deeply nested directory inside `.terragrunt-cache`. This makes it annoying and difficult to pull out to be archived in an artifact, and one of Terragrunt/Terraform/go-getter also get confused by Gitlab creating these directory structures when it moves the artifact to the next stage and fail to check out the required modules again.

THEREFORE, I came up with the idea of implementing a sort of macro replacement mechanism where certain placeholders could be added as part of commands and then Terragrunt would replace those placeholders appropriately as it processes each `terragrunt.hcl` file. This allows for precise control of where the plan files get written to and where the apply phase looks for them. There are undoubtedly other use cases for this kind of behavior; I only implemented what was necessary to make my specific use case work, though I tried to implement the feature in a way that would make it easy to add additional placeholders and replacements.

Hi,
I was wondering if the same result can be achieved using `terraform` block, like:

```
terraform {
  extra_arguments "plan" {
    commands = [
      "plan",
    ]
    arguments = [
      "-out=${get_terragrunt_dir()}/plan.cache"
    ]
  }
}
```

@denis256 That does indeed work. I was looking for a way to do more or less exactly what the description here does, and your suggestion works great! 

A nice bonus is that running `terragrunt run-all apply plan.cache` works too, as the `plan.cache` will resolve to the appropriate file when `terraform` is invoked.

Sorry, I never got a notification on your reply here. I think your suggestion should work from a technical standpoint, though I haven't tried it myself (at least not recently). I think I wanted to avoid using `extra_arguments` because those would have to be committed and then would apply equally to both CI/CD and running Terragrunt locally for dev purposes; the approach I took in the PR with the CLI flags was done to allow templating out the path to the plan cache in CI/CD only, but locally it wouldn't apply unless I also chose to run that same command. Maybe this distinction doesn't actually matter in practice, but at the time I originally wrote the code I felt like it did.

Now I remember - https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/454 was the original reason why, because extra_arguments isn't compatible with positional arguments. Using `terragrunt run-all apply plan.cache` does work, but I didn't prefer it because of the requirement to commit changes to VCS. Changing the extra_arguments block in all our `terragrunt.hcl` files will require committing changes across probably 100+ repositories and coordinating that with changes to the CI/CD pipelines they use, versus the changes I proposed which would require only modifying the Gitlab CI pipeline definitions.

I am also still finding that it does not react as expected when it runs in Gitlab. If I use the extra_arguments block and run it locally, it works as expected. When it runs in Gitlab, the `plan.cache` file still ends up deep inside the Terragrunt cache folder structure. This causes a separate issue that seems to be hitting some bug either in Terragrunt or go-getter where it mistakes the presence of the top-level Git repository to mean that it has already checked out the modules and then blows up elsewhere.

@denis256 I hope I can ask you to reconsider this proposal, because extra_arguments is not working as desired for me, whereas I have verified that the placeholder/macro stuff does work properly inside Gitlab.

**erhudy** commented *Mar 23, 2022*

I was able to resolve the initial extra_arguments issue, but a new issue has cropped up - if extra_arguments is specified in a Terragrunt file for `plan`, and then something runs `terragrunt plan -out=blah`, this seems to result in the `-out` parameter disappearing entirely. This means I can't just slip extra_arguments blocks in in certain places where I want to use run-all and then gradually roll it out everywhere else later, because the `-out` parameter disappearing from our current CI stuff is going to break all the pipelines that I haven't updated yet.

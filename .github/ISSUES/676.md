# Terragrunt apply after terragrunt init has a missing key in map

**singhujjwal** commented *Mar 13, 2019*

Hi,
I am trying to use s3 as backend for terragrunt to use and it seems after the `terragrunt init` the `terragrunt apply` is missing a key in the map to identify the backend and reports that `Backend has changed` and creates another backend
```

Backend configuration changed!

Terraform has detected that the configuration specified for the backend
has changed. Terraform will now check for existing state in the backends.


Do you want to migrate all workspaces to "s3"?
  Both the existing "s3" backend and the newly configured "s3" backend
  support workspaces. When migrating between backends, Terraform will copy
  all workspaces (with the same names). THIS WILL OVERWRITE any conflicting
  states in the destination.

  Terraform initialization doesn't currently migrate only select workspaces.
  If you want to migrate a select number of workspaces, you must manually
  pull and push those states.

  If you answer "yes", Terraform will migrate all states. If you answer
  "no", Terraform will abort.

  Enter a value: no

Migration aborted by user.
[terragrunt] 2019/03/13 03:56:04 Hit multiple errors:
exit status 1
```

It seems the `workspace_key_prefix:distplat-live-df04-phoenix` this getting lost by the terragrunt apply/plan commands.
Also in s3 instead of using the workspace_prefix value it gets set to `env:` as LockID string in dynamoDB table 
`distplat-phoenix-live/env:/distplat-live-df04-phoenix/vpc-main/terraform.tfstate-md5`

Please let me know if i am doing anything wrong here.
Thanks

I am following the documentation present here for various modules https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt#interpolation-syntax

The easiest way to reproduce the problem
```bash
terragrunt init -reconfigure -backend-config="workspace_key_prefix=ujjwal
terragrunt workspace new ujjwal
terragrunt apply
```
This throws an error saying 
```
Backend config has changed from map[region:us-east-1 workspace_key_prefix:ujjwal bucket:distplat-phoenix-live dynamodb_table:df04-phoenix-live encrypt:%!s(bool=true) key:vpc-main/terraform.tfstate] to map[bucket:distplat-phoenix-live key:vpc-main/terraform.tfstate region:us-east-1 encrypt:%!s(bool=true) dynamodb_table:df04-phoenix-live]

Terraform has detected that the configuration specified for the backend
has changed. Terraform will now check for existing state in the backends. 
```

When I say yes to the prompt, i see in s3 there is a folder created with name "env:" and all the .tfstate file is present there.

My terraform.tfvars in the root directory has the below contents

```hcl
terragrunt = {
  remote_state {
    backend = "s3"
    config {
      bucket         = "xxxxxxx"
      key            = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
      region         = "us-east-1"
      encrypt        = true
      dynamodb_table = "yyyyyy"

      s3_bucket_tags {
        owner = "Ujjwal Singh"
        name  = "Terraform state storage"
      }

      dynamodb_table_tags {
        owner = "Ujjwal"
        name  = "Terraform lock for vpc"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Any help is much appreciated.

Thanks for filing the issue and the detailed repro steps. This is the key hint as to what is happening:

```
Backend config has changed from map[region:us-east-1 workspace_key_prefix:ujjwal bucket:distplat-phoenix-live dynamodb_table:df04-phoenix-live encrypt:%!s(bool=true) key:vpc-main/terraform.tfstate] to map[bucket:distplat-phoenix-live key:vpc-main/terraform.tfstate region:us-east-1 encrypt:%!s(bool=true) dynamodb_table:df04-phoenix-live]

Terraform has detected that the configuration specified for the backend
has changed. Terraform will now check for existing state in the backends. 
```

Using Terraform workspaces is modifying the config to contain a `workspace_key_prefix`, which Terragrunt is not handling correctly, and assumes is a diff. We've not caught this before as Terragrunt is typically used as an _alternative_ to Terraform workspaces. A PR to fix the config check in Terragrunt to ignore `workspace_key_prefix` is very welcome.

Thanks for taking a look at this.

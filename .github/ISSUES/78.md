# Reformat terragrunt apply-all output

**josh-padnick** commented *Dec 19, 2016*

After using `terragrunt apply-all` for a bit, I'm starting to find this formatting frustrating:

```
Module /repos/gruntwork-clients/acme/infrastructure-live/stage/ecs-cluster depends on module /repos/gruntwork-clients/acme/infrastructure-live/mgmt/bastion-host, which is an external dependency outside of the current working directory. Should Terragrunt skip over this external dependency? Warning, if you say 'no', Terragrunt will make changes in /repos/gruntwork-clients/acme/infrastructure-live/mgmt/bastion-host as well! (y/n)
```

It's just a lot to read, especially when you're working fast. What do you think of a format like this?

```
Should Terragrunt apply the following external dependency? (y/n)

   Module:              /repos/gruntwork-clients/acme/infrastructure-live/stage/ecs-cluster
   External Dependency: /repos/gruntwork-clients/acme/infrastructure-live/mgmt/bastion-host
```

I had the same concern. I like your proposed alternative. Seems clean and elegant!

Wow, 2016.
Unfortunately, logs still look unreadable

2023 Check :'D
Using Terragrunt run-all is a mess with all these logs!

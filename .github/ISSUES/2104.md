# v0.37.0: Failure to parse S3 backend policy document

**rickys-splunk** commented *May 12, 2022*

#2063 seems to introduce the idea that terragrunt _must_ have management access to the configured backend s3 bucket. This suddenly breaks environments that generate plans with little-more-than-read-only roles and applies with elevated access.

Steps to reproduce:
- Manually create a bucket (or use a bucket that already exists)
- Create a role that has read-only access to that bucket
- Use that bucket for the s3 backend
- Try to run a `terragrunt plan`

I believe when the read only role cannot read/modify the S3 bucket, the s3 api does not return json, so the following error is observed:
```
time=2022-05-12T18:14:05Z level=debug msg=Initializing remote state for the s3 backend prefix=[REDACTED] 
time=2022-05-12T18:14:05Z level=debug msg=Checking if SSE is enabled for AWS S3 bucket REDACTED prefix=[REDACTED] 
time=2022-05-12T18:14:05Z level=debug msg=Checking if bucket REDACTED is have root access prefix=[REDACTED] 
time=2022-05-12T18:14:05Z level=error msg=json: cannot unmarshal string into Go struct field Statement.Statement.Resource of type []string
```

Since it's very common to have premade -- or widely shared buckets -- managing terraform state files, perhaps terragrunt should inform the user of configuration errors -- when available -- but not assume that it is in control of the backend bucket.


For anyone finding this issue when searching for the error message, the quick fix is to opt-out of terragrunt's bucket control mechanism by adding these lines:

```hcl
remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    skip_bucket_root_access  = true
    skip_bucket_enforced_tls = true
    disable_bucket_update    = true
  }
}
```

The only issue is that `disable_bucket_update` doesn't seem to be a config option we can specify _before_ this breaking change ... so it has to be coordinated with the update to the terragrunt version.  We use a central docker image that has terragrunt built in for all of our projects ... so that coordination is kinda painful.  It would be nice if there was a more backward-compatible way to support this, even if there's an extra `v0.36.x` release that simply allows you to add the `disable_bucket_update` config option ahead of time ... so we could add that everywhere first, then update terragrunt in our docker image.

This makes sense to me. I'll quickly hack an increment patch that will introduce this flag which does nothing for that version, but the presence should make upgrade life easier.

This comment made me realize that our docs are misleading.

Our docs recommend (and only show) using `remote_state` blocks to configure and manage the backend. However, the `remote_state` block was designed to precisely do what you are suggesting `terragrunt` shouldn't assume - fully control and manage the remote state resources, like S3 buckets.

You are right to point out that not every Terragrunt user wants that, and there is an alternative. If you don't want `terragrunt` to mess with the remote state resources but still keep the backend config DRY, it's recommended to use `generate` blocks or `extra_arguments` (if you want to use https://www.terraform.io/language/settings/backends/configuration#partial-configuration) instead of `remote_state` to manage the Terraform `backend`. This works very similarly to what `remote_state` is doing, the only difference being that now `terragrunt` won't attempt to initialize or update the remote state resources.

I've opened this PR to address this docs change: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/2106

I just released [v0.36.12](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.36.12), which is a backward compatible version for the `v0.36.x` series which supports the `disable_bucket_update` flag (and does nothing with it). So now you should be able to implement a safe upgrade to `v0.37.0` by:

- Upgrade your Terragrunt environment to `v0.36.12`
- Add `disable_bucket_update = true` in the `remote_state` block `config` map.
- Run `terragrunt` to confirm Terragrunt doesn't update the state buckets.
- Upgrade your Terragrunt environment to `v0.37.0` and confirm Terragrunt still does not update the state buckets.

Separately, I have also updated [the docs](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/keep-your-remote-state-configuration-dry/) to introduce the idea of using `generate` blocks for state backend configuration, and also include additional commentary about the purpose of `remote_state` block is to manage the state backend.

Since this is a fundamental design of `remote_state`, I don't think we would change this behavior, so between these two changes and the context in this issue + release notes + docs, we should hopefully be able to guide both old and new users.

Hopefully, that is a satisfactory answer for this issue! I'll mark this as closed since we won't take further action on this.

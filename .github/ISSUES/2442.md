hi,
will be helpful to post output of execution with `--terragrunt-log-level debug`

Additionally, can be attempted to use [aws-valut](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault) to provide all required profile settings, but this approach will work only with one profile for entire execution

I'm facing the same issue running  terragrunt version v0.38.4, however I quickly discovered that manually updating ~/.aws/config to use the legacy format will work as expected. Personally I always manually updated ~/.aws/config anyway, as opposed to using the aws configure sso wizard. That said we need to see this solved...

I've used the latest 0.45.2(at the time of writing this) in an ARM64 Macbook and got the same error, but I got it running after cloning the repository and `make build` after changing the `$$(git describe --tags --abbrev=12 --dirty --broken)` from the **makefile** to a random string.

I hope this helps someone

```shell

Does somebody know, if Terragrunt or Terraform is doing the sso stuff? Because there are similar issues in the [AWS provider repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/28263) and the [Terraform repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32465). Maybe it will be solved automatically, when both are closed. Pretty shitty situation because a lot of stuff is broken since the sso configuration change.

Terragrunt is a wrapper over terraform so there is a chance that this will be solved when that issues will be fixed

I'm getting a similar error as @lkoniecz and I seems to be a terragrunt issue, it works just fine with terraform. Also, the terragrunt seems to require two (duplicated) parameters, the `sso_region` and `sso_start_url` even tho they're already configured under the `[sso-session <sso_session>]`.

When I try to run (`terraform==1.4.6`, `terragrunt==0.45.9`) I get the error below

```text
ERRO[0000] Error finding AWS credentials (did you set the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables?): SSOProviderInvalidToken: the SSO session has expired or is invalid
caused by: open /home/<my_user>/.aws/sso/cache/<hash001>.json: no such file or directory
ERRO[0000] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1
```

So, what I did was to run the AWS CLI commands to (re)configure the local stuff

```bash
aws configure sso --profile <my_profile> --region eu-west-1
aws sso login --profile <my_profile>  --region eu-west-1 --sso-session <my_sso_session> 
```

Then I checked which files I had under the `~/.aws/sso/cache/` and I found out it wasn't the same as the `<hash001>.json`, so I create a symbolic link from the one I've `<hash002>.json` to `<hash001>.json`.

```bash
ln -s /home/<my_user>/.aws/sso/cache/<hash002>.json /home/<my_user>/.aws/sso/cache/<hash001>.json
```

Then I tried to rerun terragrunt and got a different error which points to a third file (`<hash003>.json`).

```text
Planning failed. Terraform encountered an error while generating this plan.

╷
│ Error: configuring Terraform AWS Provider: no valid credential sources for Terraform AWS Provider found.
│

```

So, to so this I create another symbolic link from `<hash002>.json` to `<hash003>.json`

```bash
ln -s /home/<my_user>/.aws/sso/cache/<hash002>.json /home/<my_user>/.aws/sso/cache/<hash003>.json
```

Now everything works just fine, but I'm not sure if these `~/.aws/sso/cache` files are created with a different name at some point, if so, then I'll have to create the symbolic links again.

---

This is what I've under my `~/.aws/config`

```conf
[profile <my_profile>]
sso_region = <my_sso_region>
sso_session = <my_sso_session>
sso_account_id = <my_sso_account_id>
sso_role_name = <my_sso_role_name>
region = <my_region>
sso_start_url = <my_sso_start_url>

[sso-session <my_sso_session>]
sso_start_url = <my_sso_start_url>
sso_region = <my_sso_region>
sso_registration_scopes = sso:account:access
```

The same issue is mentioned in `terraform`: [#28263](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/28263) [#32465](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32465). Since `terragrunt` runs `terraform` as a shell command under the hood it can do nothing until **hashicorp team** fixes it. 

But as discussed in those issues, there is a workaround. Step by step to make it work _(I will use as session name: _my-session_ and as profile name: _my-profile_)_:


1. Just in case, remove the session and profile sections from `~/.aws/config` that you are about to configure if they are already there.

2. Run 
```
aws configure sso --profile my-profile
```

The above command adds the following sections to `~/.aws/config`:
```
[profile my-profile]
sso_session = my-session
sso_account_id = xxxxxxxxxxxx
sso_role_name = xxxxxxx
[sso-session my-session]
sso_start_url = https://xxxxxx.awsapps.com/start#
sso_region = us-east-1
sso_registration_scopes = sso:account:access
```

Let's check SSO in `aws-cli`, it should work
```
aws s3 ls --profile my-profile
```

Then try to check SSO in `terraform` 
```
AWS_PROFILE=my-profile terraform init
```
get:

```
Error: error configuring S3 Backend: Error creating AWS session: profile "my-profile" is configured to use SSO but is missing required configuration: sso_region, sso_start_url
```
don't worry, we're not done yet 🙂

3. Manually edit `~/.aws/config`:

Add `sso_start_url`, `sso_region` and remove `sso_session`. Should look like this:

```
[profile my-profile]
sso_account_id = xxxxxxxxxxxx
sso_role_name = xxxxxxx
region = us-east-1
sso_start_url = https://xxxxxx.awsapps.com/start#
sso_region = us-east-1
```

4. Run 
```
aws sso login --profile my-profile
```

Let's try to check SSO in `terraform` again:
```
AWS_PROFILE=my-profile terraform init
```

get:

```
... omitted
Terraform has been successfully initialized!
... omitted
```

Finally it works 🎉 . If SSO works in `terraform`, then it will work in `terragrunt`.

@levkoburburas will terraform/terragrunt automatically refresh the authentication tokens when they expire? For reference: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/sso-configure-profile-token.html

@jsimoni if you mean `aws sso login --sso-session my-sso` unfortunately it won't. Consider using `aws-vault`.

**lebenitza** commented *Sep 29, 2023*

This should be reopened. The issue in terraform is now fixed in `Terraform v1.6.0-rc1` but the issue is still present in terragrunt. You can test that by using a `generate` block instead of a `remote_state`. When using `generate` terraform won't complain about SSO but it is going to complain the S3 bucket does not exist. In order to let terragrunt take care of creating the backend resources you need to switch to using a `remote_state` and that is when the issue appears.

For me that means there is a problem in the terragrunt auth mechanism with AWS in the bit of code that makes sure the backend resources are created.

```
❯ terragrunt init
ERRO[0000] Error initializing session: profile "<redacted> is configured to use SSO but is missing required configuration: sso_region, sso_start_url
ERRO[0000] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1
```

```
❯ terragrunt version
Terraform v1.6.0-rc1
on darwin_arm64
+ provider registry.terraform.io/cloudflare/cloudflare v4.15.0
+ provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws v5.19.0
```

```
❯ terragrunt --version
terragrunt version 0.51.6
```

The workaround still works by moving `sso_start_url` and `sso_region` to the profile entry in aws config.

Still an issue with `terragrunt`.

```text
terragrunt init        
time=TZ level=error msg=Error initializing session: profile "<child-profile>" is configured to use SSO but is missing required configuration: sso_region, sso_start_url
time=TZ level=error msg=Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1
```

But when I drop into the cache directory, all works fine with `terraform`.

```text
cd ./.terragrunt-cache/<HASH>/<HASH>
terraform init
...
terraform plan
...
terraform apply
```

```text
terragrunt

terraform version
Terraform v1.6.2
on windows_amd64
+ provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws v5.22.0
```

At first I thought it might be the outdated [winget terragrunt package](https://winget.run/pkg/Gruntwork/Terragrunt),
But testing on the newest release results in the same:
```text
terragrunt --version
terragrunt version v0.52.4

terragrunt init        
time=TZ level=error msg=Error initializing session: profile "<child-profile>" is configured to use SSO but is missing required configuration: sso_region, sso_start_url
time=TZ level=error msg=Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1

I now suspect it's something inside of `terragrunt`.
Maybe in the `aws_helper` ?
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/b8cf75fb6e88d36d43933efa40a473e242b2b77d/aws_helper/config.go#L78-L83


Removing my [`remote_state`](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/keep-your-remote-state-configuration-dry/) config (that uses a s3 bucket configured with a sso profile) fixes terragrunt
Also running the `remote_state` config with a profile that doesn't use sso allows terragrunt to function.

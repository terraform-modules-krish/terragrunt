# unable to control {optional,required}_var_file precedence 

**jhoblitt** commented *Feb 8, 2019*

Consider the following `terraform.tfvars`:
```hcl
terragrunt = {
  terraform {
    extra_arguments "common_tfvars" {
      commands = ["${get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars()}"]
      optional_var_files = [
        "${get_tfvars_dir()}/${find_in_parent_folders("common.tfvars", "ignore")}"
      ]
    }
  }
}
domain_name = "foo.example.org"
```
where `common.tfvars` is
```
domain_name = "bar.example.org"
```
tg will construct the tf command line such that `terraform.tfvars` is implicit while `optional_var_files` is explicitly declared as `-var-file ...`.  This seems to result in any variable declared from a `{required,optional}_var_files` as having precedence over the "local" `terraform.tfvars` and the resolved value of `domain_name` ends up being `bar.example.org`.  This is exactly the opposite behavior of what I would expect -- specifically, that vars further down the hierarchy override the values of those closer to the root.  I believe this could be resolved by explicitly declaring the "local" `terraform.tfvars` with `-var-file` which appears only after any `{required,optiona}l_var_files`. Eg.,

```bash
 terrafrom apply -var-file .../common.tfvars -var-file .../terraform.tfvars
```

As this would be a change to existing semantics, perhaps it could be controlled by a flag in the `terragrunt {}` block?

I suspect this is related #132 but ultimately an orthogonal concern.

This is part of Terraform's design. As [per the docs](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html#variable-precedence):

> Definition files passed using the -var-file flag will always be evaluated after those in the working directory.

@brikis98 I am aware that terraform has documented precedence rules for var evaluation.  This feature request is completely about how terragrunt is explicitly and implicitly passing vars to terraform.

I'm a bit worried about doing something that is 100% counter to the logic built-into Terraform. If you want `terraform.tfvars` to go last, you can probably specify the file explicitly using `optional_var_files`.

I'm affected by this issue as well. My use case is that I have a common GCP region/zone declared in a shared hcl file, but then in a couple of modules I want to override this. Since I've put all my module variables in an `inputs = {}` block inside each terragrunt.hcl, `optional_var_files = ["${get_terragrunt_dir()}/terragrunt.hcl"]` doesn't work right out of the box, unfortunately..

If you are using `terragrunt.hcl` for your inputs, you need to merge them into the `inputs` attribute of the running config using `read_terragrunt_config`. E.g., in our example, see how we read in a bunch of common vars in the folder tree (https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example/blob/master/terragrunt.hcl#L9), and then merge them in: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example/blob/master/terragrunt.hcl#L60

With `merge`, overriding is done by passing in the dict later in the args. E.g., if `override.hcl` contains values to override the zone defined in `common.hcl`:

```
locals {
  common_vars = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folder("common.hcl"))
  override_vars = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folder("override.hcl"))
}
inputs = merge(local.common_vars.inputs, local.override_vars.inputs)
```

Closing as stale and a workaround is provided. If there are any follow up questions here, please open a new issue. Thanks!

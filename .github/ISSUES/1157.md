# get-all command?

**jamesgoodhouse** commented *Apr 28, 2020*

I like the idea of being able to run `plan-all` and `apply-all`, but our current Terraform setup has us running `terraform get -update` to check for any updates of modules before running. I see there's a `terragrunt get`, but what about a `terragrunt get-all` command?

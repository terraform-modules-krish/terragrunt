# get_tfvars_dir -> get_terragrunt_dir missing in documentation

**jfreeland** commented *Aug 4, 2019*

https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.12.1 refers to https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt#get_tfvars_dir which doesn't exist, nor does the page mention it.  For completeness, it might be handy to mention that get_tfvars_dir was renamed?  It could potentially help someone else to mention that it was renamed as it could slow them down when upgrading and rewriting old terragrunt files.

You are probably trying to use a very old version of terragrunt. The function was added in `v0.12.1` and got renamed in `v0.19`.

It is mentioned in the migration guide https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/_docs/migration_guides/upgrading_to_terragrunt_0.19.x.md#rename-a-few-built-in-functions

Version 0.12.1 was released in 2017.

As @ekini mentioned, the function was renamed in `v0.19` and documented as such in the migration guide, which is linked in the release notes.

In the future, if you want to see the docs for a particular version, you can click the tag link to browse the repository at that tag:

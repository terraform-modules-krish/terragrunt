# Enabling root access to s3 bucket fails with NoCredentialProviders error

**ghost** commented *May 21, 2020*

# What's going on?
By default, when Terragrunt creates the S3 remote state bucket, it enables root access by inserting a bucket policy (pr that added the feature: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/978). I'm receiving an error during the creation of the root access policy;

`terragrunt version: v0.23.8`
`terraform version: v0.12.24`
```

```

[I'm supplying AWS credentials using the `~/.aws/config` file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sourcing-external.html)
```cfg
[profile developer]
credential_process = /opt/bin/awscreds-custom --username helen
```

# Why is this happening?

In the pull request https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/978, the [GetAWSCallerIdentity function](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/978/files#diff-daa6ec53485cb8f2effb648e81b76827R109) is creating a session that does not use the same [configuration that is used to create the S3 client](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/46f39e035dc84f5facf6b0829c94d14084a91362/aws_helper/config.go#L41-L57).

This does not allow Terragrunt to add the root access policy when a user is sourcing their credentials like I have above.

[The first commit](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/978/commits/273141a68b70f2e46f8faf46166b3697c49904bf) in the pull request did not introduce this bug. [Once the commit was made to use the config util/helper functions](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/978/commits/a4e647a201e0c10b61505504e2bc0ed29b9b26d8), was the moment the bug was introduced.

Thank you for the detailed bug report! The information you provided helped me to develop a fix quickly. Hopefully we'll have the fix in #1193 merged soon.

@KadenLNelson Out of curiousity, do the built-in `get_aws_*` functions work for you? E.g.

 [`get_aws_account_id`](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/built-in-functions/#get_aws_account_id)
[`get_aws_caller_identity_arn`](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/built-in-functions/#get_aws_caller_identity_arn)
[`get_aws_caller_identity_user_id`](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/built-in-functions/#get_aws_caller_identity_user_id)

These functions do not include any session configuration, so I'm guessing that your credential configuration wouldn't work with them.

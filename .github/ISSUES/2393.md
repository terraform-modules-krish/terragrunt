# Add tests for GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN in tflint hook

**ina-stoyanova** commented *Dec 13, 2022*

This is a spin-off tickets from #2837. 

@denis256 I've struggled to see what valuable tests I could add. This ticket is to hold any of our discussions and work that go into the integration tests you've recommended adding.

Additionally, not in the scope of this issue, but the integration tests seem to be failing with the last few merges into master. I've created a separate issue for that [here](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/2394).

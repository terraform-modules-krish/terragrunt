# "terragrunt plan [directory]" does not forward through directory argument

**kevinburke** commented *Oct 12, 2017*

If I run

```
terragrunt plan --terragrunt-source=/path/to/source-dir path/to/plan-dir
```

I expect it to run plan in the `plan-dir`, per the Terraform docs: https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/plan.html

```
Usage: terraform plan [options] [dir-or-plan]
```

(I guess I assume that the `dir` there will plan the dir you provide? It's tough to verify that.)

Anyway when I run the `terragrunt plan` above, I get:

```
[terragrunt] 2017/10/11 21:26:30 Error reading file at path mypwd/terraform.tfvars: open mypwd/terraform.tfvars: no such file or directory
```

when I expect it to load mypwd/path/to/plan-dir/terraform.tfvars instead.

Terragrunt looks for its configuration file, `terraform.tfvars`, in the current working directory. It doesn't know that some Terraform commands allow you to specify a different working directory and therefore the `terraform.tfvars` file will be there. 

I can see a few options:

1. Use the `--terragrunt-config` flag to point to the `terraform.tfvars` file.
1. Use `--terragrunt-working-dir` to change the working directory Terragrunt is using. 
1. Submit a PR to make Terragrunt aware of all of the commands in Terraform that change its working directory. This sounds like something that would potentially be painful to maintain, but perhaps doable with tests.

```
Use terragrunt-working-dir to change the working directory Terragrunt is using.
```

Is this a binary or a script from somewhere on my path?

Ah, sorry, it's a command-line param :)

```
terragrunt plan --terragrunt-working-dir /foo/bar
```

Ah, ok. FWIW, At first I typed `--terragrunt-working-directory` and was confused when it didn't exit.

I'm trying this now:

```
/Users/kevin/bin/terragrunt plan --terragrunt-config=dev/us-west-2/dev/services/myservice --terragrunt-working-dir=dev/us-west-2/dev/services/myservice --terragrunt-source /Users/kevin/src/path/to/company/../modules/services//myservice
```

and it's still trying to load terraform.tfvars from the wrong directory:

```
Error reading file at path /Users/kevin/src/path/to/company/terraform.tfvars: open /Users/kevin/src/path/to/company/terraform.tfvars: no such file or directory
```

(I'm trying to put plan commands in a Makefile, and it would be cumbersome/tedious to set up a Makefile in every subdirectory/service I want to run plan/apply for)

Ah, you're right: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/config/config.go#L173. It ignores the working dir and just uses the default config path :-\

So looks like two fixes:

1. If there is ` --help` or `-h` flag, don't look for a config file at all.
1. Respect the working dir when loading the config file.

The first issue is already reported in #314. I'd welcome a PR for the second!

> --terragrunt-config: A custom path to the terraform.tfvars file. May also be specified via the TERRAGRUNT_CONFIG environment variable. ... This argument is not used with the apply-all, destroy-all, output-all, validate-all, and plan-all commands.

over in #367 i was only having the issue on `destroy` and `destroy-all` works for me.

Can we fix this? Also, In the above, I can solve this problem by setting either the env `TERRAGRUNT_CONFIG` or `--terragrunt-config`, but from the terragrunt's getting started page https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/getting-started/quick-start/

"Having to remember these -var-file arguments every time can be tedious and error prone." Following this philosophy, why not just use the terragrunt.hcl in the dir I specify

Why not? It would be trivial to parse this out, is there something I'm missing?

Parsing is not the hard part. Keeping up with all the changes to Terraform—all the CLI commands and args—is where it potentially gets messy.

**steeling** commented *Sep 24, 2020*

IMO it's worth solving. I've already shot myself in the foot running it from the wrong dir, and it seems like others have the issue as well. In particular I'd be concerned about team usage, ie: I can have good practices around this, but in a team setting it can be harder to enforce.

Do you think its worth solving in terragrunt proper? Alternatively I could just wrap it and share with my team

I was wondering if this might help you:
```hcl
terraform {
  extra_arguments "plan_file" {
    commands = ["plan"]
    arguments = ["-out=${get_terragrunt_dir()}/tfplan.binary"]
  }
}
```

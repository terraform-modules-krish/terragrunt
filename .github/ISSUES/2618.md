# Graph Dependences for read_terragrunt_config

**NickSpaghetti** commented *Jun 21, 2023*

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I would like to be able to obtain an path(s)/dependencies for any terragrunt.hcl file that include `read_terragrunt_config('pathTo/common.hcl')`.  We use common.hcls in our infrastructure-live and if one of those files change I would like to run a plan/apply on the files that have a dependency on file included with read_terragrunt_config('').  So that I do not have to manually make a comment/space bump in the files that reference `read_terragrunt_config('pathTo/common.hcl')` to get our workflows to pick up changes made to that file. I have solved this issue with a complex github workflow, but Instead I would like a terragrunt command to output a list of file paths that use read_terragrunt_config('') and the order in which the files must be ran in if some of those files have a dependency block on other modules.  

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I have tried to use the following bash command to solve this issue:
```bash
find "$(pwd)" -type f -name 'terragrunt.hcl' -exec grep -q 'common\.hcl' {} \; -exec dirname {} \; | xargs -I{} readlink -f {}| grep -v '/.terragrunt-cache/'
```
There are a few issues with using the following command:
1.  I have to filter out terragrunt-cache and will have to maintain a filter out list if anything else changes.
2.  I would have to run this in every directory that may use read_terragrunt_config to get the full list. 
3.  This method does not take into account of files that have may have a dependency on another module. 

**Additional context**
We use common.hcl files to keep our terraform code dry so if a value in a file changes it would have a down stream affect on any of our terragurnt.hcl files that is called in `read_terragrunt_config('pathTo/common.hcl')`.I have built a workflow in a github actions to run plan in parallel based on  a common.hcl file that has changed and giving it a list of files that use that common.hcl file.  I would like to replace this complex workflow with a terragrunt command that would output the same information without having a giant config file telling the workflow what to run based on what common.hcl file was changed.

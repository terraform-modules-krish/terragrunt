# ref in terraform source (git) gets truncated if containing slash

**zeno420** commented *Jun 7, 2023*

**Describe the bug**
Using a git branch name containing a forward slash as ref in the terraform source results in the branch name being truncated at the slash.

ERRO[0000] 1 error occurred:
	* error downloading 'ssh://git@gitlab.com/repo.git?ref=feat': /usr/local/bin/git exited with 1: error: pathspec 'feat' did not match any file(s) known to git


**To Reproduce**
```hcl
terraform {
  source = "git::git@gitlab.com:repo.git//.?ref=feat/example"
}
```

**Expected behavior**
Terragrunt using the correct and complete ref.

**Versions**
- Terragrunt version: v0.46.2 (it works with v0.45.18)
- Terraform version: v1.4.6
- Environment details: macOS Ventura 13.4 (darwin_amd64) (but also on an M1 and a Ubuntu)

# [feature request] Support invoking multiple modules in a single terragrunt.hcl

**leiarenee** commented *Dec 7, 2020*

Is there anyone to handle this feature with me.

Using beforehook to copy the extra modules?

Implementing multiple modules requires a pretty big overhaul of given the change in terragrunt's mental model. Our thinking on how to achieve this is https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/759, but that won't be coming anytime soon given the drastic nature of the change.

However, if anyone in the community has a better idea to implement this, we are open to suggestions as RFCs and comments.

Hi , #759 talks about something very different and hard to implement. It is not same context with this.

When a module is fetched it usually needs other modules and if those sub modules are in the same repository there is no way to fetch them locally. I've found a workaround using beforehook. Beforehook copies the necessary sub modules to cache folder and main module can fetch them as relative paths. It is very easy to implement this without restructuring the Terragrunt. 

Suggestion:
```
locals {
 module_path="${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/modules"
}

terraform {
  source = "${local.module_path}/terraform-app-deploy"
  
  submodules = [
   # These are sub modules called by main module
  "${local.module_path}/terraform-yaml-configurator",
  "${local.module_path}/terraform-deploy-yaml",
   
  # This is bash and python scripts folder
  "${local.module_path}/scripts" 
  ]
}
```

These can be done with before hook, and I'm using that way. But The solution offered above would be much more elegant than using copy. Terragrunt will copy those sub modules into cache folder. That's all. 

Current Implementation:
```
locals {
 module_path="${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/modules"
 all_commands=["apply", "plan","destroy","apply-all","plan-all","destroy-all","init","init-all"]
}

terraform {
  before_hook "before_hook" {
    commands     = local.all_commands
    execute      = ["cp", "-R", "${local.module_path}/scripts","."]
   }

  before_hook "before_hook" {
    commands     = local.all_commands
    execute      = ["cp", "-R", "${local.module_path}/terraform-deploy-yaml","."]
   }
}
```

Thanks for the reply and please consider it as an improvement wish from a Terragrunt fan. Not a request.

Ohhhh I think I get what you are asking.

If you are fetching local module paths via relative path, the way to do it in terragrunt is to use `//` in the source to indicate that you want to copy everything up to that dir, and then subdir into the remaining path.

You should be able to avoid all the before hook copying with the following config:

```
locals {
 module_path="${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/modules"
}

terraform {
  # Note the // after `local.module_path`.
  source = "${local.module_path}//terraform-app-deploy"
}
```

This is covered in our docs on [remote terraform configurations](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/keep-your-terraform-code-dry/#remote-terraform-configurations):

> (Note: the double slash (//) in the source parameter is intentional and required. It’s part of Terraform’s Git syntax for [module sources](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/sources.html). Terraform may display a “Terraform initialized in an empty directory” warning, but you can safely ignore it.)

We have a repo with terraform that is common to several projects, and I would like to add some project-specific infrastructure as well.  What is the best way to do that currently?

But still limited with a single source.  Please note these files (TF,Bash,Py)  are as used as supplementary to the main source.

I do it as described below by creating them on the fly in a before hook. since TG does not offer a specific way.  You can use it either within the parent include file `terragrunt.hcl`, in such cases where it is common to all folders,  or in the infrastructure specific custom `terragrunt.hcl` depending on your use case. 

Please note that the procedure described below is for cases where TF common modules are stored within the same repository with Terragrunt live repository under `modules` directory located in same level with parent include file. 

For remote repositories you can follow the same method, fetching the content in some way rather than copying. 


```terraform
locals {
 module_path="${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/modules"
 commands=["apply", "plan","destroy","apply-all","plan-all","destroy-all","init","init-all"]
}

terraform {
  before_hook "before_hook" {
    commands     = local.all_commands
    execute      = ["cp", "-R", "${local.module_path}/scripts","."]
   }

  before_hook "before_hook" {
    commands     = local.commands
    execute      = ["cp", "-R", "${local.module_path}/terraform-deploy-yaml","."]
   }
}
```

Infrastructure specific source will be your main source defined in your custom tg file defined under source while common ones should be copied into cache folder during runtime and referred with relative paths from your main source TF.

__EXAMPLE__
```terraform
# Terraform module to deploy generic K8s YAML configurations.
module "k8s_yaml_tf" {
  module_enabled = var.module_enabled
  module_depends_on = var.module_depends_on
  source = "../terraform-deploy-yaml"  
  appConfig = {
      "${var.namespace}-${var.application_name}" = {
        k8s = {
          for deployment, config in var.deploy:
            deployment => config
        }
      } 
    }
}
```

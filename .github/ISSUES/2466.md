# Critical vulnerability in terraform 0.15.3 CVE-2018-9057 

**abhip** commented *Feb 23, 2023*

Hi team 

There is a critical vulnerability in terraform 0.15.3 and I noticed that in terragrunt we cannot upgrade to latest version of terraform (https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/go.mod) is there any alternative way or can I build terragrunt without that binary.

thank you
<br />

Hello,
I quickly checked [CVE-2018-9057](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r48h-jr2j-9g78) and don't see to affect terraform binary itself, looks like it is an issue in `terraform-provider-aws` provider

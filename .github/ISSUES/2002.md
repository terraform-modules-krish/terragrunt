# Terragurnt stalles in Azure DevOps

**seyedk** commented *Jan 31, 2022*

I'm trying to run terragrunt in Azure DevOps pipelines with following settings: 
1. Terraform v 1.1.4
2. Terragrurnt  v0.36.0
3. AWS CLI v2

The terragrunt.hcl file is using the example in the [terragrunt quick start](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/getting-started/quick-start/#example). 

The following ADO pipeline does nothing, no errors, no progress, and after 1 hour the pipeline fails. 

```
- task: CmdLine@2
  displayName: "list hcl files"
  inputs:
    script: |
      set -euo pipefail
      echo  '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)'
      aws sts get-caller-identity | cat
      cd build/terragrunt
      terragrunt apply
```
I tried to change the `source=` in the configuration to `git` or a local ADO repo accessible to ADO...but nothing happens. I ensured that terragrunt is kicked off; when I changed the source URL to something wrong, it complains with errors like could not find double // or could not find the location of the module. but Once I correct the wrong entries, it does nothing.  

Also found this blog for some hints to configure the git with "Authorization bearer", or changing permissions on Azure Organization/project settings. None worked. Â

The only output I see (without any error or warning)
```
/home/vsts/work/1/s
{
    "UserId": "XXXXXXX<MY USER ID>XXXXXXXXX:sessionname",
    "Account": "<myaccount>",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:sts::<myaccount>:assumed-role/<myrole>/<session_name>"
}
time=2022-01-31T14:20:08Z level=info msg=The stack at /home/vsts/work/1/s/build/terragrunt will be processed in the following order for command apply:
Group 1
- Module /home/vsts/work/1/s/build/terragrunt
- Module /home/vsts/work/1/s/build/terragrunt/backend-app
```

but even that does not work for me. Please help. 

Is there any example or walkthrough in using Terragrunt with Azure DevOps Pipelines? That will be really helpful. 

PS that example works just fine running `terragrunt plan/apply` locally.

I'm going to close this issue as the solution was not relevant to Azure DevOps (ADO). The issue above has been as simple as including the --auto-approve and non-interactive when calling `terragrunt apply` as shown below: 

```
terragrunt apply --terragrunt-log-level debug --terragrunt-non-interactive --auto-approve

```
Also, it's always a good practice to enable the debug mode (as used in the command above) to easily diagnose the issue. It's a time saver!

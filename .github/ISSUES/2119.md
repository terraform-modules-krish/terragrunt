# fetch dependency output from state directly

**Ido-DY** commented *May 22, 2022*

I have a few components that have many dependencies, when I run `terragrunt plan` it could take a few minutes to run.
I ran the plan with `--terragrunt-log-level debug` then I saw that for each dependency, Terragrunt is executing `terraform init`and `terraform output -json`.

I compared the output of `terraform output -json` with the state stored in my S3 bucket and it was just the same, then I made an experiment: for all of our components, I configured Terrraform to skip `init` and return the output from the bucket directly when called on a dependency with `output -json` by Terragrunt.

My experiment shows incredible results by performing the `plan` action up to 10X time faster while preserving just the exact result.

I saw in the code that the dependency output is fetched from the remote state by executing `terraform init && terraform output -json` : https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/020ad12980358b8fabb8b9d778e5bc15dd3b211f/config/dependency.go#L522

Now I wonder about a few things:

1. Have you considered fetching the output of dependencies directly from the state files (by an API call to the backend), instead of `terraform init && terraform output -json` ?
2. Will you accept such contribution ?
3. Do you see any risk with this approach ?

While I agree that this will most likely be the fastest approach, I worry that this may be brittle. Off the top of my head, I can see the following risks with this approach:

- What will we do if the project isn't using S3? E.g., the backend is in Terraform Cloud, or GCP?
- How do we keep track of all the version formats? E.g., what happens when Terraform updates the internal representation of the state object? When do we deprecate support for a particular state representation?
- Should we handle state locking? E.g., `terraform output` gets a read lock on the state file so that it doesn't try to read it out when an `apply` is actively happening on it. Should we mirror that behavior?

With that said, I think this is probably a good addition to have given that terraform output reading tends to be a looming performance concern. I think I would be open to a contribution that makes this, provided that:

- It is opt-in (that is, we don't default to this mechanism of extracting outputs)
- The state extracting logic is encapsulated in a way that we can extend this to GCS buckets and other backends in the future.
- There is a good, maintainable way to handle changing state representations.

Does terragrunt cache the output of dependencies in any given run, or is it running init and output multiple times for the same dependency? Maybe a cache of the outputs for a given dependency would be a big improvement?

Terragrunt has an in-memory cache with locking so that it only makes a dependency call once. See https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/config/dependency.go#L415-L419

The cache key should be the absolute path to the dependency config, so it should work regardless of how `targetConfig` is ultimately defined in each `dependency` block.

But this cache only works for the current process, so it is only used when you do a `run-all`.

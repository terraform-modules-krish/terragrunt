# before_hook freezes when setting up a SSH tunnel in it. 

**aleksanderaleksic** commented *Mar 3, 2021*

I am trying to set up an ssh tunnel with a `before_hook` for a module to configure elasticsearch, but the subprocess "freezes"/gets stuck after running `terragrunt apply`. 

```
before_hook "open_tunnel_through_bastion" {
    commands     = [
      "plan",
      "apply",
      "plan-all",
      "apply-all"
    ]
    execute      = [
      "ssh",
      "ec2-user@bastion.${dependency.dns.outputs.zone.name}",
      "-N",
      "-f",
      "-L",
      "${local.bastion_port}:${dependency.elasticsearch.outputs.elasticsearch_endpoint}:443",
    ]
    run_on_error = true
}
```

The command resolves into something like this: `ssh ec2-user@bastion.dev.domain.com -N -f -L 9921:vpc-some-vpc-endpoint.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com:443` which runs fine when I execute it in the terminal.

This is parts of the log output:
```
[terragrunt] [/home/terragrunt/dev/us-east-1/elasticsearch-config] 2021/03/03 11:48:45 Detected 1 Hooks

[terragrunt] [/home/terragrunt/dev/us-east-1/elasticsearch-config] 2021/03/03 11:49:39 Error forwarding signal: os: process already finished
```
I am able to confirm that the command works as I am able to access the resource from a different terminal session.
If I try to terminate the apply I get the error `Error forwarding signal: os: process already finished`.
The only way I'm able to stop the apply is if I kill the ssh process, `kill $(lsof -t -i:9921)` then it will continue with the apply.

I have been able to work around this by using a `screen` session that runs in the background, but that's not available for windows that some of my team members use.

Any idea why this is happening?

This is because of https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/856#issuecomment-530091210, and is not supported by terragrunt.

A new construct for managing hooks with background processes is necessary to implement this, which will require some design.

@yorinasub17 I have the same problem but not in hooks, but in Terraform plan itself

if you use `data "external"` program / script 
and this program/script use external binary which under the hood run daemon process (even in background)

in our case we use [1password cli](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/v1/get-started/)

```
data "external" "one_password" {
  program = ["${path.module}/one_password.sh"]
  
  query = {
    vault    = xxx
    url      = xxx
    email    = xxx
    password = xxx
    secret   = xxx
  }
}
```

one_password.sh >>
```
#!/bin/bash
set -e

...

export OP_DEVICE=xxxxx
export OP_RETRIES=4
export OP_SLEEP=10

eval $(echo "$password" | op signin $url $email $secret --shorthand=xxx) || exit 1
...

echo $json | jq
```

Terraform plan finished successfully but Terragrunt stuck.
Last output log:
```
Plan: 4 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This plan was saved to: /xxx.tfplan
To perform exactly these actions, run the following command to apply:
    terraform apply "/xxx.tfplan"
```
and stuck ...


I thought that 1password (op) client works just as cli tool but then notice that execution of "op signin" run "op daemon" process (cli doesn't support flags to disable this daemon)

```
/ # ps aux
PID   USER     TIME  COMMAND
    1 root      0:00 /bin/bash
   35 root      0:00 bash
   44 root      0:00 sh
  121 root      0:00 op daemon <<<<
  136 root      0:00 ps aux
 ```

And main concern of course that we don't have such issue with vanilla Terraform, issue reproduced after migrating to Terragrunt :(

Hi @aleksanderaleksic,

I tried to reproduce the issue using your example, but I didn't manage, everything worked fine, the tunnel opened and terragrunt continued working. The code may have been changed since then and this issue has gone away.

Anyway there is a solution, to use `nohup`

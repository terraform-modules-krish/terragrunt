# Terragrunt assumes hasicorp/<provider> when generated provider block is used

**ch9hn** commented *Apr 14, 2023*

Hello,
we faced some issues with the generated provider blocks from Terragrunt.

In our module we have a file called "versions.tf":

```
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.4"
  required_providers {
    scaleway = {
      source  = "scaleway/scaleway"
      version = ">= 2.16"
    }
  }

}
```

When we add a provider block in the base terragrunt.hcl:


```
#Generate a SCW Provider Block
generate "provider" {
  path      = "provider.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite"
  contents  = <<-EOF
    provider "scaleway" {
      region          = var.region
      zone            = var.zone
      organization_id = var.organization_id
}

variable "region" {
  description = "SCW Region."
}
variable "zone" {
  description = "SCW Zone."
}

variable "organization_id" {
  description = "SCW Orga ID"
}

  EOF
}
```



We get the following errors - also with other providers which are not from hashicorp because the merging of the files is not consistent
```

│ Error: Failed to query available provider packages
│ 
│ Could not retrieve the list of available versions for provider
│ hashicorp/scaleway: provider registry registry.terraform.io does not have a

╵

```

The only solution is, to replicate the provider configuration into every module.

Does someone have similar issues ?

Are you referencing the module in a root module where also the base terragrunt lives?

Hi, I'm experiencing the same issue with the Doppler provider. Looks like it's trying to install from hashicorp instead of 3rd party registry.

We have the following structure (this is for testing):

`terragrunt.hcl`
```
remote_state {
  backend = "local"
  config = {
    path = "${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
  }

  generate = {
    path      = "versions.tf"
    if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
    contents  = <<-EOF
      required_providers {
        doppler = {
          source = "DopplerHQ/doppler"
          version = "1.3.0"
        }
    EOF
  }
}

generate "provider" {
  path      = "provider.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite"
  contents  = <<-EOF
    provider "doppler" {
      doppler_token = "<token>"
    }
  EOF
}
```

Running `terragrunt init`
```

# Terragrunt evaluating all submodules for locals with `--terragrunt-strict-include`

**celestialorb** commented *Apr 12, 2021*

Not sure if Terragrunt needs to do this or if this is intended design, but it seems that when using `run-all` in combination with `--terragrunt-strict-include` and `--terragrunt-include-dir` Terragrunt will still iterate over every submodule to evaluate locals. This, in my case, resulted in Terragrunt downloading more providers than expected. While this isn't exactly a problem, I found it to be quite confusing.

My setup is that I have a module (A) that I wanted to run `init` on via `run-all init` with `--terragrunt-strict-include` and the appropriate `--terragrunt-include-dir` flag, and another module elsewhere (B) that reads in an extra HCL file via `read_terragrunt_config` into a local variable; and this HCL file includes a dependency to another module (C). Module (A) has no dependencies, but in order to get the outputs of module C for the locals of module B, Terragrunt has to initialize module C, causing it to pull down the providers required for it. Thus Terragrunt downloads the extra providers for module C during the initial locals evaluation of a `run-all` command.

The behavior I would've expected here is that there would be no evaluation of locals for any modules outside of those specified by the `--terragrunt-include-dir` flags.

Is this intended / necessary, or could this be considered a bug?

I have crafted a basic PR to address this, let me know if the approach taken in it is viable, or if there is another approach / option that should be considered here.

This is still occurring as of version `0.50.11`

Hi Team I have installed terragrunt latest version i.e 0.36.6 for ubuntu

Version installed through homebrew - terragrunt_darwin_amd64
but while running terragrunt plan I am getting below error
 **/usr/local/bin/terragrunt: 1: /usr/local/bin/terragrunt: Syntax error: "(" unexpected** 
<br />

Hi,
it can be multiple issues:
  * wrong architecture - terragrunt_**_darwin_**_amd64 most probably will work only on MacOS or ubuntu on Mac hardware
  * broken downloaded file - what shows `file /usr/local/bin/terragrunt` ? it is executable or text file?

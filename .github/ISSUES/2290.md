# Allow setting environment variables

**AssafKatz3** commented *Sep 28, 2022*

Hi,

There are a few specific [environment variables](https://www.terraform.io/cli/config/environment-variables) that Terraform uses. I think Terragrunt should allow to specify them, especially those that there are no other equivalent options like TF_DATA_DIR & TF_IN_AUTOMATION.
I suggest a simple block that allows a set of any environment variable except those which start with TF_VAR_ or TERRAGRUNT_, for example:
```
environment = {
  TF_IN_AUTOMATION = "true",
  TF_REGISTRY_DISCOVERY_RETRY = 1000
}

```

This is already doable using runcmd().

```
set_environment = run_cmd("export", "MY_VARIABLE=${local.my_variable}")
```

Hi,
The code above won't help since it won't modify the environment of children processes.
Thanks

Hi,
if environment variables are required only in terraform execution, can be attempted to workaround this through `before_hook`

Hi,
As far as I understand, the terraform isn't run through the shell, so I don't see any option to create such a workaround.
Thanks

@AssafKatz3 IMO the best thing here is to just set the env vars in the parent shell, the one calling terragrunt.

@denis256 Re: setting the env using `before_hook`, over in [this issue](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1581) it was said that hooks don't actually change the child processes env.  I haven't tested this myself, but the documentation says nothing about thing about any guarantees on the child process is environment. So im guessing that hooks are run in a separate subshell from the terraform process.

..and @pconstantine I would think the same is true for `run_cmd`.

Hi,
I know that I can set environment variables in the parent shell, but the idea of terragrunt is reducing such requirements. I don't want to repeat it again.
Thanks

Setting env vars in `before_hook` didn't work for me, however I was able to workaround this using the `env_vars` setting in the `extra_arguments` block.

This is probably a solution for my concern, so I will close, thanks.

Could you give a code example on how you did it?

Sure:
```
terraform {
  extra_arguments "kubernetes_provider_config" {
    commands  = ["plan", "apply"]
    arguments = []
    env_vars = {
      KUBE_HOST                 = "foo"
      KUBE_CLUSTER_CA_CERT_DATA = "bar"
      KUBE_TOKEN                = "baz"
    }
  }
}
```

# Enhancement: Make Terragrunt Recursive

**gte250p** commented *Oct 16, 2020*

Would be nice if terragrunt projects (those directories containing terragrunt.hcl files) could make their "source" be another terragrunt project, as opposed to a terraform module.  This would enable some of terragrunt's nice fixes for terraform to be used (such as source can have variable interpolation).  For example, please review the included project.

Could you explain some use cases where recursive helps? I know you attached a `.zip` file, but it would be good to capture this in writing or even an RFC: https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/community/contributing/#file-a-github-issue-or-write-an-rfc

Terraform contains certain limitations which terragrunt helps to overcome.  Using variables in places where terraform doesn't allow is one of them.  My specific use case is this:
https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/1439
(I would like to use a variable for my module's remote repo but terraform prohibits me)

So, I understand wanting to be able to specify modules dynamically, but how does allowing the `source` URL in `terragrunt.hcl` to point to another Terragrunt project (another `terragrunt.hcl`) help with that? 

FWIW, you can _already_ use variables in the `source` parameter, so if you want to load different Terraform modules dynamically, you can. It's the loading different _Terragrunt_ modules dynamically that I don't fully follow?

 I have a large terragrunt project, spread across several accounts in AWS.  Some of these accounts contain a "workload" which is not-unique; ie, there are multiple workloads that contain the same code base (sometimes different versions of it) with varying configuration parameters.  

I would like to maintain the workload itself as a terragrunt project, with 50 or so modules (terragrunt.hcl files).  

Then, inside of my larger AWS project, which contains non-workload accounts also, I'd like to pull this workload terragrunt project in as a module to my existing terragrunt project, and pass variables specific to that workload, whichever it may be.

Now I could maintain that workload account as pure terraform, and it call other terraform modules.  The current issue with that is the terra**form** does NOT allow the variables in the source of a **modules** block (ref the bug mentioned above).  I need to make my version control repository a variable which terra**grunt** allows, but not terra**form**

Sorry for the delay. Got pulled away to work on other things.

What does it mean to include a "terragrunt project," with 50 modules, inside another project? When you run `apply` on the latter, does it run `apply` on all 50 modules?

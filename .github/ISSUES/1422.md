# Terraform fails when using remote_state.disable_init

**ksvladimir** commented *Nov 11, 2020*

I'm using disable_init to prevent terragrunt from accessing remote state bucket on its own (reason explained below). However, this also disables initializing the backend by terraform: it passes `-backend=false` to terraform init. As a result, the backend is not initialized and all terragrunt commands result in errors:

```
$ terragrunt plan
...
[terragrunt] [/tf] 2020/11/11 21:14:49 Running command: terraform init -backend=false
...
Terraform has been successfully initialized!
...
[terragrunt] 2020/11/11 21:14:56 Running command: terraform plan
Backend reinitialization required. Please run "terraform init".
Reason: Initial configuration of the requested backend "gcs"
...
Error: Initialization required. Please see the error message above
```

I think a better behavior would be have remote_state.disable_init prevent terragrunt itself from creating the state file in the remote bucket (or accessing the remote bucket bucket in any way), but not prevent terraform itself from initializing the state backend.

The reason this is needed in my case is that I'm using `impersonate_service_account` option in terraform 0.14-rc1, and terragrunt doesn't understand it yet, so it fails whenever it tries to access the remote bucket. I hoped I could solve it by using `emote_state.disable_init`, but I run into this problem.

This makes sense, although not sure if the right fix is to introduce another flag or remove the backend initialization (probably the latter).

Workaround: if you don't intend on using the automatic creation of the state bucket, then it is slightly more preferable to use the `generate` pattern to generate the backend configuration as terraform code, since you aren't getting much from the `remote_state` block. This has the added flexibility of supporting subblocks for backend configuration that uses them (e.g., `workspace` blocks in `remote` backend).

```hcl
generate "backend" {
  path = "backend.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  contents = <<EOF
terraform {
  backend "gcs" {
    # ... your backend configuration ...
  }
}
EOF
}
```

Thanks for the tip, using generate is a reasonable workaround for my problem!

I added TF_INPUT = "false" as env and now I am getting a different kind of error log:

It appears that for non trivial examples with modules, etc. this is often not working at all. I end up getting `terraform init` backend required errors...

For instance, just trying this official Google terragrunt setup, where they claim the `run-all validate` should work (and they have `disable_init` env flag), it does not work passed the 2nd module validation.

I need to setup linting tools on CI, without requiring it to have credentials to remote backend!

@yorinasub17 Heya, followed your advice here to use `generate` instead of `remote_state`. Our bucket is created beforehand, so was no need. And we wouldnt even worry, until we started using service account that impersonates another service account. Those initial calls terragrunt makes to GCS just failed all the time. Spent almost a month on and off debugging this :D

What I noticed now is that after this, if a module has dependencies doing a simple `terragrunt plan` expects ALL dependencies to be in initialzied condition, it goes through all lock files and all that. This is definitely different from what using `remote_state` did. Is this behaviour part of dependency optimization in `remote_state`? Hoping there is a way to mimic this with using `generate` for backend?
many thanks 🙏

@dennislapchenko This is indeed part of dependency optimization in `remote_state`, and unfortunately, it's not easy to mimic this with `generate` for the backend. The reason for this is that `terragrunt` uses the knowledge of `remote_state` to create a pared down terraform module that only has the state backend configuration, which is what allows it to do a faster `init` without parsing anything in the config.

Once you switch to using `generate`, terragrunt doesn't really have a way of knowing if the `generate` block is for a provider configuration or the backend configuration. I think we would need a new block or a flag on `generate` or `remote_state` to address this use case, but it isn't immediately obvious to me what makes the most sense here.

If you have some ideas for a proposal on what makes the most sense, that would be most helpful!

@yorinasub17 thanks for the reply!
I think a flag on `remote_state` would make the most sense. There is `skip_bucket_creation` and understanding to explicitly set it to `true` moved my investigation further, but then still a deadend, until switching to `generate`. So, unless its required for dependency optimization, it would be nice to have a flag that would skip all extra calls to backend that terragrunt is doing when using `remote_state`. But I suspect this logic could be exactly for optimization purpose, to do it before fully going into terraform exec. 
Maybe its possible to use, in case of GCS, `impersonation` in that request? because thats the issue we were facing, that `remote_state` impersonation was added, but it wasnt picked up in that initial hidden terragrunt call.

Would be happy to provide more info if this wasnt clear enough, maybe can even lurk into the code if you point a finger :D

Any update on this? I'm running into the same issue. I'd prefer to avoid using a `generate` block because I wouldn't be able to take advantage of [terragrunt-fetch-dependency-output-from-state](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli-options/#terragrunt-fetch-dependency-output-from-state), as outlined in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/2279.

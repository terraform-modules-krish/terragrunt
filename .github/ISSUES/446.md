# Running Terragrunt with non-interactive flag inside Docker container

**mazzy89** commented *Mar 22, 2018*

I'm running Terragrunt inside a Docker container:

```shell
docker run mazzy/terragrunt:0.14.3 apply --terragrunt-non-interactive
```

Then when I run then the container from a Makefile target I can't go ahead. I get this:

```shell
Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value:

Error: Apply cancelled.


[terragrunt] 2018/03/22 23:17:51 exit status 1
Makefile:18: recipe for target 'build' failed
make: *** [build-shared] Error 1
```

There is no possibility to add any input. I mean the execution ends quickly by failing

I've already tried with `TF_INPUT=0` and `-input=false`. But no luck.

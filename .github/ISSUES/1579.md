# Using 'random_password' in a Terragrunt input?

**boldandbusted** commented *Mar 10, 2021*

Howdy. I'd like to use the output from the `random_password` resource in Terragrunt.  What's the best way to do that? Do I have to create a dedicated module just to output the result? Thanks!

Terragrunt doesn't create any resources or data sources, so yes, you'd need Terraform code for this. You can either create a module for it or use a [`generate` block](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#generate).

`generate` block! Thank you!

# Terraform reports "Terraform files in .... are up to date. Will not download again."  even when that's not true

**tvaughan77** commented *Oct 17, 2018*

We have a terragrunt module that manages an AWS ASG (among other things) and it's got a main.tf and a variables.tf 

In the variables.tf we have a variable like this:
```
variable "size_max" {
    default = "8"
}
```

So that in our actual terraform.tfvars file(s) for all the different ASGs we run, we can normally just keep the default size.

We recently wanted to bump up the max from 8->20 so I updated the module with the new default of 20 and committed it to github.

Running `tf apply` on any of the existing terraform.tfvars files that use the module reports that no changes need to be made because:
```
13:52 $ tf apply
[terragrunt] 2018/10/17 13:52:18 Running command: terraform --version
[terragrunt] 2018/10/17 13:52:18 Reading Terragrunt config file at /Users/xxx/workspace/upside/aws-config-terraform/upside/us-east-1/prod/services/square/terraform.tfvars
[terragrunt] 2018/10/17 13:52:18 Terraform files in /Users/xxx/.terragrunt/k3osnOTO3zRm7DY0kQKiMrmIMKk/Z5koEZ0VeJfCX7RniNVYAco3gjo/modules/upside-micro-service-asg are up to date. Will not download again.
[terragrunt] 201....etc/snip
```

However, if I `rm -rf /Users/xxx/.terragrunt/k3osnOTO3zRm7DY0kQKiMrmIMKk/Z5koEZ0VeJfCX7RniNVYAco3gjo/modules/upside-micro-service-asg` and re-run `tf apply` the second run successfully notices that the max size should be changed in the ASG and applies it as expected

What does your `source` URL look like?

Terragrunt's caching is fairly simple/dumb: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/cli/download_source.go#L150-L176

Also, you can use `--terragrunt-source-update` to force it to update the cache

The soruce in our terraform.tfvars file looks like:
```
terragrunt = {
  include {
    path = "${find_in_parent_folders()}"
  }
  terraform {
    source = "git::git@github.com:mycompay=ny/aws-config-terraform.git//modules/upside-micro-service-asg"
  }
}
```

I'll give the `--terragrunt-source-update` flag a try; thanks!

# Feature Request: Shared and overridable variables (globals?)

**apottere** commented *Aug 2, 2019*

## Background
For most of our terraform projects, we prefer to keep the remote state in the same region as the resources that are being created.  This allows us to manage resources in other regions when S3/DynamoDB is down in a particular region.

We also have a pretty standard directory structure for services:
```
terraform
├── terragrunt.hcl
└── <account>
    └── <region>
        └── <environment>
            └── terrgrunt.hcl
```

With the addition of terraform functions, it was simple to get the region from the directory name and use that in the backend configuration.

However, we also have a separate structure containing all of the infrastructure that doesn't belong to a single application - and this structure is much less predictable.  Some resources have multiple directories before the region, and some don't have a region directory at all.  Since many of these resources don't (and shouldn't) conform to the structure above, it would be very convenient to specify a `region` variable in the parent `terragrunt.hcl` that can be overridden in the child `terragrunt.hcl`.

There are certainly ways to work around this right now, but what I would love to be able to do is:
```
globals {
  region = "us-east-1"
}
terraform {
  source = ...
}
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}
```

## Proposed Solution
I would like to implement something similar to `locals`, except keys in the block would be merged with the parent config (with child definitions overwriting parent definitions).  Thus, the config resolution order would be:
1. `locals`
2. `include`
3. `globals`
4. Everything else

This would accomplish three things:
1. Defining variables in parent config that can be used in every child config
2. Defining variables that the child configs can use to affect the behavior of the parent config
3. Allowing for intermediate variables that would otherwise go in `locals` but need the relative path to the parent config

## Questions
1. Is this something that seems like a good idea?  Should I create a PR for this?
2. Is `globals` the correct name, or is there something better?


This is a result of https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/802#discussion_r310202282 and possibly related to #132.

Since I suggested this, I am on board with this idea! Although, I am curious to hear others' opinions about separating `globals` (temporary common vars that are auto merged across `include`) from `locals` (temporary common vars that are scoped to the current config).

I am a bit confused by what you mean by `the config resolution order` in the proposed config. If `globals` works exactly like `locals`, then the access to it should be explicit (e.g `global.region`). Can you elaborate a bit more on this?
***

**apottere** commented *Aug 6, 2019*

By `the config resolution order`, I mean the order that the blocks in the terragrunt HCL file are are evaluated.  I was assuming the `include` block depends on `locals` being interpolated (which I didn't verify), but regardless `globals` would need to depend on the `include` block being evaluated if globals are merged across includes.

Edit:  Yes, access would be explicit (e.g. `global.region`)
***

**apottere** commented *Aug 6, 2019*

If you wanted to make it even more complicated, in reality `locals` could depend on `globals` as long as those `locals` aren't used in the `include` block.  I'm not sure if that confusion is worth it, though.
***

**apottere** commented *Aug 6, 2019*

After some more thought, I have an alternate proposal:

* `include` is a new variable "group" that gets set when the `include` block is evaluated:
    * `include.relative` would replace the function `path_relative_to_include()`
    * `include.parent` would replace the function `get_parent_terragrunt_dir()`
    * `include.child` would replace the function `get_terragrunt_dir()`
    * Another function could be added to get the path to the file that the expression is in, e.g. `get_current_file()`
* `locals` are variables that are only usable within the context of this `terragrunt.hcl` file.  They can reference other `local` or `include` variables, as long as they don't cause a reference loop (i.e. a `local` can't reference an `include`, and also be used in the `include` block).
* `globals` are variables that are merged with the child `terragrunt.hcl` file before being evaluated.  By nature, they can use `include` variables but cannot be used in `include` blocks.

Both `globals` and `locals` can reference each other, as long as they don't cause a dependency loop.  A `local` referenced from a `global` would refer to the `local` from the file that the `global` expression is in - i.e. if a child overrides a global with an expression that includes a `local`, that would be the child's `local`.

This strategy would accomplish a few things:
1. It would remove the requirement of only being able to use the "include" functions (relative path, etc) in `globals`, simplifying the semantics of `global` and `local` ("should this variable be shared or not shared?")
2. It would disambiguate the "include" functions - right now they're available everywhere, but their behavior changes depending on which part of the config they're called from.
3. It would make the config a lot more terraform-like, which would probably be more intuitive for new terragrunt users coming from terraform.  Instead of defined resolution phases, any variable can be used anywhere as long as it doesn't cause a loop.

As far as implementation goes, looking through the terraform code it doesn't seem incredibly complicated to copy the variable discovery, graph creation, graph verification, and evaluation.  Some code from the terraform project could even be imported and re-used.

Thoughts?

**jfunnell** commented *Aug 7, 2019*

One minor issue I have with the current implementation of locals is that I cannot use the `path_relative_to_include` in a local definition. This limits a chunk of my use cases and I guess the above proposal fixes that.. But I'm not entirely sure why it's necessary to change the well known and documented path-discovery function calls to an `include` group? Seems like a huge change.

As for the original proposal, a lot of my locals are being passed down to the underlying child modules using inputs, so yeah I would say this seems like a good idea in general.

Ah that is a good point and an oversight on my part. The original proposal for `globals` would indeed address that!

> include is a new variable "group" that gets set when the include block is evaluated

While I understand where you are going with this, I think this could overcomplicate the implementation. Right now the path functions are implemented as simple go functions, which makes them fairly easy to maintain. Having to fold them into the include block requires adding additional custom parsing logic while the include is being created, that then needs to be passed down throughout the code to each execution contexts. I can see this being unintuitive and a pain to maintain.

I'd say that for now, start by implementing the basic version of `globals`, which are `locals` that get auto merged across `include` blocks. Since `locals` are relatively new, I'd wait for it to be tested in the wild for a little bit longer before we start optimizing the implementation with complex execution orders that allow interdependencies between `locals`, `include`, and `globals`. My hunch is that the basic `globals` will cover 90% of use cases that require referencing the `include` paths.
***

**yorinasub17** commented *Aug 9, 2019*

And it might turn out that we don't need `locals` once `globals` is implemented.
***

**yorinasub17** commented *Aug 9, 2019*

Thanks for going through this thought exercise by the way! Very helpful in understanding why you need it, and your thought process on approaching the implementation!

**brikis98** commented *Aug 9, 2019*

What's the difference between `globals` and `inputs = { ... }` in the root config?
***

**yorinasub17** commented *Aug 9, 2019*

`globals` can be referenced in the children `inputs`. E.g if you had:

```
globals {
  region = "us-west-1"
}
```

You can have a child config that is:

```
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

inputs = {
  s3_url = "com.amazonaws.${global.region}.s3"
}
```
***

**brikis98** commented *Aug 9, 2019*

Would that be different than adding support for inputs referencing other inputs? E.g., `s3_url = "com.amazonaws.${inputs.region}.s3"`? 

Or how does this compare with a `get_input([<FILE>], <INPUT>)` helper? We know we want to add `get_output`, and it seems like `get_input` is a natural analog. You can either specify an explicit a `FILE` to read inputs from, or if you omit it, it uses the current inputs, merged with parent inputs.
***

**yorinasub17** commented *Aug 9, 2019*

I think `get_input` makes sense, but independent of `globals`. In fact, we should probably also have `get_local` and `get_global`, or even a full `import_input/local/global` function that imports the full map to make it less verbose.

The benefit of `globals` is: What if you don't want it to be passed in as an input to terraform? `globals` gives you a space to specify variables that you don't intend to pass to any module, but use to build up the other inputs. It seems clean to have these temporary variables built up there instead of as `inputs` which will be converted to `TF_VAR_xyz` env vars.
***

**brikis98** commented *Aug 9, 2019*

Oh, I was thinking `get_input` could read values out of other `.hcl` or even `.yml` files. So then you could have `vars.hcl` and put a bunch of your locals/globals/etc in there. Perhaps `get_input` makes it sound like it _only_ reads the `inputs = { ... }` block, but that's not really the goal.

BTW, I'm not 100% set on any approach here and am just thinking out loud. My main goal is to find the minimal set of tools we could expose for defining, sharing, reusing, and passing variables around. So the question is whether `locals` / `globals` provides a more flexible toolset than `get_input` (and `get_output`)? Or if some other option is even more effective? Might be worth listing out all use cases we want to support (e.g., local var usage, sharing vars from parent, getting vars from other modules, getting vars from var files, etc).

Re: replacing the path functions with static variables:

On the contrary, I think using functions for this is actually the unintuitive way to do it.  In terraform, functions are available and idempotent no matter where they're used.  If `globals` are added, the behavior of these functions would differ between usage in the `local` and `global` blocks.  In `local`, they would resolve to `.`, and in `global` they would be a real path.  To me, that doesn't seem like an ideal solution.  In terraform, dependencies are expressed by accessing properties of other resources, not with function calls.  Assuming terragrunt users are terraform users first, this is probably the more intuitive way to do it.

We can still forego complicated dependency logic for now by just erroring if the `include` variables (or functions) are used in a `local` variable.

<hr />

Re: `globals` replacing `locals` entirely:

It would definitely be possible to replace globals with locals, but I see two issues with that (assuming simple dependency logic):
1. You wouldn't be able to use any variable in an `include` block, since that block would need to be interpreted before `globals` could be.  Right now, you could use a `local`.
2. Encapsulation is generally accepted as a good practice, i.e. you shouldn't expose information that you don't need to.  This keeps your code simple and reduces the chance of bugs.  Removal of `locals` would cause every variable you use in your parent config to be available from your child config, and you could accidentally override those variables from the child if you re-use the name accidentally.  If something doesn't need to be global, it should be kept local.

<hr />

Re: `get_input`:

What's the use-case for this?  It seems to me all of those cases would be covered by good `local` and `global` system.  Would this be a way to share variables between different terragrunt projects?
***

**apottere** commented *Aug 13, 2019*

I'm definitely willing to whip up a PoC even if it needs significant changes before being merged.

**yorinasub17** commented *Aug 13, 2019*

> On the contrary, I think using functions for this is actually the unintuitive way to do it.

I wasn't talking about the end user UX. I was talking about the code that actually implements it. So it isn't about whether or not it is intuitive to users of `terragrunt` or `terraform`, but rather whether or not it can be implemented in a way that is easy to maintain and has few bugs. In other words, will the implementation be intuitive to the golang developer?

This is why I mentioned this should be addressed independent of the `globals` implementation, because I expect `globals` would be fairly easy to implement (and thus can be released sooner), while the path parsing stuff might be difficult and tying the `globals` implementation to that might delay the implementation of the feature.

> What's the use-case for this?

The main use case for this is if you want to fragment the `globals` across multiple HCL files that are nested across the tree. Right now `terragrunt` doesn't allow more than one `include`, so there is only one level of depth even for `globals`. `get_input` is a way to import and reference multiple HCL files, replacing the `yaml` based system of merging multiple variable files.
***

**apottere** commented *Aug 13, 2019*

> I wasn't talking about the end user UX. I was talking about the code that actually implements it.

Ah, sorry, I completely misunderstood that.  I think it should be just as easy to implement - just remove those functions and add a variable group to the evaluation context when evaluating everything but `locals` and `include`.  It definitely can be separated from the initial `globals` implementation if you think that would be better.

> The main use case for this is if you want to fragment the globals across multiple HCL files that are nested across the tree.

Cool, thanks for the explanation.  Is multi-include being considered, and if so would `get_input` just be a quick stopgap until that gets figured out?  Or have you decided that multi-include isn't a good idea?
***

**yorinasub17** commented *Aug 13, 2019*

> add a variable group

I think you are underestimating the complexity of interjecting something to the parsing pipeline to add this. But who knows! I might be missing some clever way to do this.

> It definitely can be separated from the initial globals implementation if you think that would be better.

Yes let's keep that separate.

>  Is multi-include being considered, and if so would get_input just be a quick stopgap until that gets figured out? Or have you decided that multi-include isn't a good idea?

You can see https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/303 for past thoughts on this, as well as some current thoughts. In general, multi-include is not something we want to add and if possible would like to use other primitives to achieve the same effect. `get_input` is one of those proposed primitives.
***

**yorinasub17** commented *Aug 13, 2019*

By the way, you might want to hold off on implementation until I am done with https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/828. `globals` will almost certainly conflict with that feature. Also, the new partial parsing pipeline might help make the `include` path variable context implementation easier.
***

**apottere** commented *Aug 13, 2019*

> I think you are underestimating the complexity of interjecting something to the parsing pipeline to add this.

I don't think so, unless I'm missing something.  It should be just as easy as adding `locals` to the evaluation context:
```go
	if locals != nil {
		ctx.Variables = map[string]cty.Value{"local": *locals}
	}
```
In fact this function definition already has the value of the include block available to it:
```go
func CreateTerragruntEvalContext(
	filename string,
	terragruntOptions *options.TerragruntOptions,
	include *IncludeConfig,
	locals *cty.Value,
) *hcl.EvalContext {
```

> By the way, you might want to hold off on implementation until I am done with #828.

Thanks for the heads up, it definitely looks that way.  I'll do some initial exploration but I won't spend too much time on it till that's complete.
***

**yorinasub17** commented *Aug 15, 2019*

Ok #828 is now merged. Also, I've refactored the eval context parameters into a struct `EvalContextExtensions` which should make it easier to pass through the include vars all the way down.

So @apottere , feel free to start working on this! Be sure to think through where `globals` fits in the parsing pipeline and update the docs accordingly. Here are two places where we document the parsing pipeline:

- In the README: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt#configuration-parsing-order
- In the code: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/config/config.go#L270

@yorinasub17 I got really busy, but I finally had some time to put together a POC of this in #858.  Let me know what you think.

I decided to go for the more complicated approach because I was pretty sure I could make it work and it was more fun to try and figure out.  I can definitely implement a simpler approach if you want.

I do something a little like this, but with recursion hell. Not sure how interested people would be to use it.

terragrunt.hcl ( I don't use inputs, in terragrunt.hcl I generate a vars file since I hit the system limit for commandline length )
```
# This will load all the locals from root.hcl and inject them here.
include "root" {
  path   = find_in_parent_folders("root.hcl")
  expose = true
}

locals {
  merged_locals = include.root.locals.merged_locals
}

terraform {
  source = include.root.locals.merged_locals.MODULE_PATH
}
```

root.hcl -  I read the top most level here
```
vars = read_terragrunt_config("${local.og_tg_dir}/instance.hcl")
```

In instance.hcl I read and merge all lower levels
```
locals {
  merged_locals = merge(
    local.global_vars.locals,
    local.environment_vars.locals,
    local.subscription_vars.locals,
    local.region_vars.locals,
    local.service_vars.locals,
  )
  og_tg_dir = get_original_terragrunt_dir()

  service_vars      = read_terragrunt_config("${local.og_tg_dir}/../service.hcl")
  region_vars       = read_terragrunt_config("${local.og_tg_dir}/../../region.hcl")
  subscription_vars = read_terragrunt_config("${local.og_tg_dir}/../../../subscription.hcl")
  environment_vars  = read_terragrunt_config("${local.og_tg_dir}/../../../../environment.hcl")
  global_vars       = read_terragrunt_config("${local.og_tg_dir}/../../../../../globals.hcl")
} 
```
*Note: This is just snippets so it doesn't tell the whole story or describe the entire solution, but hopefully you get the gist of it.*

And I do the same for service, region, sub, env. While also in each lower namespace I subtract those files that are higher up.
In service.hcl I do not load instance.hcl for example.

I do this because I want to gain access to all the variables and use them in a higher namespace. It takes like 40 seconds to parse everything.

An alternative could have been to merge it all the end instead of this in every single level. Then it goes much much faster, but I as I want to have all the vars from below.. its a bit of a tradeoff. But honestly, is speed such a big deal for infra if I'm going to wait for an azure virtual gateway to come up in 25 minutes.. :zzz:  

I use the same approach for modules, so that I can override terraform module versions per instance, service, region, sub, env.. etc..

I've done this for quite a few of my projects.. if you know a better way or if you think I'm crazy for doing it this way, I'm always open to learn.


edit: I guess its a bit like phatcher gave an example on in the mentioned issue here: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1942
***

**gw0** commented *Jun 19, 2023*

I came up with something very similar, but instead of using `locals {}` am using `inputs = {}` everywhere. This causes a bit less cognitive load and makes specifying inputs is a bit less verbose. The root module then merges all inputs from all layers.

Example of root module with this and a few more ideas:
```
locals {
  path_parts         = concat(split("/", path_relative_to_include()), ["", "", "", ""])
  common_config      = read_terragrunt_config("${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/common_config.hcl", { inputs = {} })
  environment_config = read_terragrunt_config("${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/${local.path_parts[0]}/environment_config.hcl", { inputs = {} })
  ...
  inputs = merge(
    {
      terraform_tag    = path_relative_to_include()
      environment_name = local.path_parts[0]
      ....
    },
    local.common_config.inputs,
    local.environment_config.inputs,
    ...
  )
}
inputs = local.inputs
```

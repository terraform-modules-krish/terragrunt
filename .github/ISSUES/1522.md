# Proposal: Error hooks

**Ben10k** commented *Feb 2, 2021*

The idea behind error hooks is to execute arbitrary shell commands when a terraform command returns an error. 

Example syntax would be similar to `before_hook` and `after_hook` with required properties `commands` and `execute` and instead of `run_on_error` a different property `on_errors` would be required that would describe a list of errors on which should the hook run, described in the same manner as `retryable_errors`.

An example configuration that imports would run a shell script with `terraform import`:
```hcl
terraform {
  error_hook "import_resource" {
    commands  = ["apply"]
    execute   = ["./import_known_resource.sh"]
    on_errors = [
      "(?s).*A resource with the ID .* already exists.*",
    ]
  }
}
```

The idea behind this proposal is that there are some resources on terraform-providers that create an 'umbrella' resource which can create some child-resources on the cloud provider which are not being represented as a terraform resource. In some cases, the default child-resource configuration is ok, but when that resource needs to be modified, it becomes problematic.

One example of this would be an `azurerm` resource `azurerm_api_management` creates 2 `azurerm_api_management_product` instances which have one `azurerm_api_management_product_policy` each. The `product` can be accessed as `data` but the `product_policy` needs to be imported to state in order to be accessible from terraform.

This seems reasonable! We're buried with other initiatives so most likely won't implement this any time soon, but PRs from the community are welcome!

@yorinasub17 @Ben10k anyone working on this? If not I can take this over

Instead of adding new type of hook wouldn't it be better to add `run_only_on_error` to existing hooks and we also add error message and exit code as env vars and let the script that gets executed by the hook decide what to do. Thoughts?

@smitthakkar96 I did not have a chance to work on this, you can take over.

Although I am not sure if adding `run_only_on_error` instead of adding a new hook type is the way to go, as I believe it would increase both the complexity of terragrunt and the readability of the `terragrunt.hcl` configurations.

@Ben10k thanks for your response, your comment regarding complexity and readability makes sense. I have one more question, what will the ordering be like? Will after_hook with `run_on_error` execute first or `error_hook` execute first?

+1 to @smitthakkar96's question on ordering. Maybe for most cases, the ordering doesn't matter.

# `apply-all` should error if TERRAGRUNT_SOURCE is specified

**yinzara** commented *Sep 12, 2020*

I caused a MAJOR production outage across a set of tenants because I accidentally had the TERRAGRUNT_SOURCE environment variable set when I performed an "apply-all" across our tenants.  This caused more than 800 resources across 6 customers to be deleted because TG attempt to apply the source from TERRAGRUNT_SOURCE against a set of terragrunt.hcl files that were for different modules.

TERRAGRUNT_SOURCE is incompatible with `apply-all` unless all modules being applied are for the same source.  `apply-all` should have prevented this from happening either by erroring or prompting me to confirm specifically about TERRAGRUNT_SOURCE.

Sorry to hear you hit this issue. That sounds really painful ðŸ˜• 

FWIW, we use `TERRAGRUNT_SOURCE` quite regularly with `apply-all`, especially when spinning up totally new environments. That said, there are a number of limitations / gotchas with `TERRAGRUNT_SOURCE`, and we've captured a proposal for a better replacement in #1138. Let's continue the discussion in there. I'll close this issue for now.

# Add support for outputting "metadata" in the render-json command

**brikis98** commented *Jul 14, 2022*

Something that would make `render-json` even more powerful for debugging is if the output included not only the fully-resolved values, but also other metadata, such as "breadcrumbs" that tell you where that value was found. This likely means changing the JSON output format, so we'd probably only want this with some flag like `--with-metadata`. 

For example, let's say this is the original `render-json` output (truncated to keep the example simple):

```json
{
  "generate": {
    "provider": {
      "comment_prefix": "# ",
      "contents": "# This is just a test",
      "disable_signature": false,
      "if_exists": "overwrite",
      "path": "provider.tf"
    }
  },
  "inputs": {
    "foo": "bar",
    "baz": "blah"
  },
  "terraform": {
    "source": "./foo"
  }
}
```

Here's what `render-json --with-metadata` might look like:

```json
{
  "generate": {
    "provider": {
      "value": {
        "comment_prefix": "# ",
        "contents": "# This is just a test",
        "disable_signature": false,
        "if_exists": "overwrite",
        "path": "provider.tf",
      },
      "metadata": {
        "found_in_file": "/live/dev/vpc/terragrunt.hcl"
      }
    }
  },
  "inputs": {
    "foo": {
      "value": "bar",
      "metadata": {
        "found_in_file": "/live/dev/vpc/terragrunt.hcl"
      }
    "baz":  {
      "value": "blah",
      "metadata": {
        "found_in_file": "/live/terragrunt.hcl"
      }
  },
  "terraform": {
    "source": {
      "value": "./foo",
      "metadata": {
        "found_in_file": "/live/_envcommon/vpc.hcl"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In other words, every value because an object with the keys: 

* `value`: The original value goes here.
* `metadata`: Extra metadata goes in this object. Initially, the most useful metadata would be `found_in_file`, which gives you the file path where this value came from: you can see in the examples above, that may be a "child" config (`/live/dev/vpc/terragrunt.hcl`) or a parent config pulled in via `include` (`/live/terragrunt.hcl`, `/live/_envcommon/vpc.hcl`). In the future, we may also want to add metadata such as the name of the `include` that was used to pull in that file, the type of merging done, etc.

@denis256 Do you have any sense of the complexity of implementing this `render-json --with-metadata` functionality?

Also, it would be useful for `locals` metadata to indicate what locals are available in the parent config (includes). Even though they may not be available for use, it may be useful for deciding if one should use `expose = true`.

And just to add some context to why I'm asking:

- We may want to have access to this metadata in a new product we're building (the product will need to be able to introspect Terragrunt code).
- But I have no sense if adding support for metadata is a day of work, a week of work, a month of work, etc. If it's too expensive, it's probably not worth doing now. So any guesses on how complicated this is would be really helpful!

Hi,
to add additional fields on `render-json` I thought about:
 * adding of "metadata" map field to [`TerragruntConfig` ](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/config/config.go#L33) to store metadata for all fields
 * add code to set metadata during execution
 * during `render-json --with-metadata` fetch metadata for respective field from map and include in output

This approach looks more feasible than changing each `TerragruntConfig` field to have "value" and "metadata"

Implementation shouldn't take more than a week

Roger. Do you have time to start on this now by any chance? Along with the related `render-json` changes in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/2198?

Yes, started to work on it
Drafted a [PR](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/2199) which include metadata for locals

Before changes `render-json` :
```
  "locals": {
    "aws_profile": "prod",
    "aws_region": "us-east-1",
    "aws_tags": {
      "test": "test"
    }
  },
```
with changes from PR:
```
  "locals": {
    "aws_profile": {
      "metadata": {
        "found_in_file": "/projects/gruntwork/terragrunt-tests/locals-tf/terragrunt.hcl"
      },
      "value": "prod"
    },
    "aws_region": {
      "metadata": {
        "found_in_file": "/projects/gruntwork/terragrunt-tests/locals-tf/terragrunt.hcl"
      },
      "value": "us-east-1"
    },
    "aws_tags": {
      "metadata": {
        "found_in_file": "/projects/gruntwork/terragrunt-tests/locals-tf/terragrunt.hcl"
      },
      "value": {
        "test": "test"
      }
    }
  },
```

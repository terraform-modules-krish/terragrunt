# `terragrunt-debug` is printing out invalid commands (and failing to process an S3 credentials file)

**pzduniak** commented *Feb 13, 2022*

Here's the repro:
```
deployments
|- dev
  |- terragrunt.hcl
modules
|- cluster
  |- backend.tf
  |- other tf files
terragrunt.hcl
```

Root terragrunt.hcl (pointed against Oracle's S3-compatible API) contains:
```
...
remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  generate = {
    path      = "backend.tf"
    if_exists = "overwrite"
  }
  config = {
    bucket                      = "terraform-state"
    key                         = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
    region                      = local.object_storage_region
    endpoint                    = "https://${local.object_storage_namespace}.compat.objectstorage.${local.object_storage_region}.oraclecloud.com"
    shared_credentials_file     = "${path_relative_from_include()}/../secrets/terraform/aws_credentials"
    skip_region_validation      = true
    skip_credentials_validation = true
    skip_metadata_api_check     = true
    force_path_style            = true
  }
}
```

Deployment's terragrunt.hcl contains:
```
terraform {
  source = "../..//modules/cluster"
}

inputs = {
  regions = {
    home    = "us-ashburn-1"
    cluster = "ca-toronto-1"
  }

  base_domain     = "dev.example.com"
  cluster_name    = "dev"
}

include "root" {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}
```

Without the "source" block and a main.tf in the directory, it's all alright and I can run `terragrunt init`, which correctly reads the credentials from the path. However if not using the current working directory (ie. specifying the `terraform.source` arg), the shared_credentials_file doesn't work (defaults to whatever's in `~/.aws/credentials`). So naturally the next step is to debug it...

```
deployment/dev $ terragrunt init --terragrunt-log-level debug --terragrunt-debug
...
DEBU[0000] Variables passed to terraform are located in "/base/deployments/dev/terragrunt-debug.tfvars.json"  prefix=[/base/deployments/dev]
DEBU[0000] Run this command to replicate how terraform was invoked:  prefix=[/base/deployments/dev]
DEBU[0000]       terraform init -var-file="/base/deployments/dev/terragrunt-debug.tfvars.json" "/base/deployments/dev/.terragrunt-cache/7jtQ3GlhnddApKuE9uO2MWLqsrY/abgPHKGbJIxg_mezQdYIQF9VrQI/modules/cluster"  prefix=[/base/deployments/dev]
```
This is not a valid Terraform command, which is the first issue:
```
terraform init -var-file "/base/deployments/dev/terragrunt-debug.tfvars.json" "/base/deployments/dev/.terragrunt-cache/7jtQ3GlhnddApKuE9uO2MWLqsrY/abgPHKGbJIxg_mezQdYIQF9VrQI/modules/cluster"
Too many command line arguments. Did you mean to use -chdir?
```
So my suspicion is that... it's actually using chdir? Assuming that also changes the working directory, that would explain why it's failing to look up the file - a `../../../secrets/terraform/aws_credentials` points at `/base/deployments/dev`, rather than `/`.

I'm super disappointed that this is broken this way. I expected a bit more from a solution that claims to support this particular use case.

FWIW this is also broken with backend managed through flags. Probably for the same reason.

Have this same issue. Trying to debug something related to remote_state and the terraform command it provides does not run. Also, I have inputs set but those are not shown in the output to replicate as a comprehensive terraform command.

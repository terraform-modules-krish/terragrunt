# terragrunt hclfmt: support for -diff mode enhancement

**zraider7** commented *Dec 6, 2021*

Currently, `terragrunt hclfmt` will tell you if there are errors with your hcl file, but not display what they are if you are using `--terragrunt-check` flag. Example:
`terragrunt hclfmt --terragrunt-check --terragrunt-log-level error`

`terraform fmt` has this functionality with the `-diff` switch to show you what changes it would end up doing, which is great for CI and the end-user feedback loop. Could this also be implemented at a terragrunt level?

# Make max retry attempts and sleep interval configurable

**andreykaipov** commented *Apr 2, 2021*

I saw from [your docs](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/auto-retry/) this is something you'd be open to:

> Future upgrades to terragrunt may include the ability to configure max retries and retry intervals in the terragrunt config (PRs welcome!).

My corp network is absolute dogshit so even three retries is not enough to save our infrastructure, so I'd like to help!

I'll submit a PR later today but figured I'd open up this issue too for tracking purposes.

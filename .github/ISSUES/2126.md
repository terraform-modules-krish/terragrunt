# Private DNS Zone Group creation fails 1 minute into execution/creation

I am trying to create a private endpoint for azure monitor private link scope (AMPLS) resource and like any other private endpoint, even this one needs "private_dns_zone_group".  Private endpoint for AMPLS should be integrated with more than one private dns zones. TF resource looks like this 

```
resource "azurerm_private_endpoint" "main" {
  name                = <randomname>
  resource_group_name = <randomname>
  location            = <location>

  subnet_id = <subnetid>
  private_service_connection {
    name                           = format("%s-svc-connection", var.private_endpoint_name)
    is_manual_connection           = var.is_manual_connection
    private_connection_resource_id = <resource_id>
    subresource_names              = <subresource_names>
  }
  private_dns_zone_group {
    name                 = format("%s-private-dns-group", var.private_endpoint_name)
    private_dns_zone_ids = ["privatelink.monitor.azure.com","privatelink.ods.opinsights.azure.com","privatelink.agentsvc.azure-automation.net","privatelink.blob.core.windows.net"]
  }

  tags = var.private_endpoint_tags
}
```
Expected Result - 
private endpoint created successfully and integrated with these private dns zones

Actual result - 
fails with this error message, right after 1 minute into resource creation ```waiting for creation of Private DNS Zone Group "somename-dns-group" for Private Endpoint "somename-private-endpoint" (Resource Group "<rgname>"): Code="InternalServerError" Message="An error occurred." Details=[]```

Hi,
not sure if this is an issue with Terragrunt since in the end Terraform is invoked to handle Azure

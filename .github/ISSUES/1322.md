# Dependency optimization init is too slow when there are no nested dependencies

**yorinasub17** commented *Aug 28, 2020*

Since `v0.23.35`, we introduced dependency fetching optimization where it attempts to only handle a single level of dependencies instead of recursively fetching. This depends on running `init` to configure the backend in a working directory to run `output` on.

However, this ignores the cache, and so this is much slower for folks that had only one layer of dependency before. We can further optimize the dependency fetching if we leverage the cache. That is, if the terragrunt cache already exists for the dependency (the module is properly initialized), we should be able to immediately run `terraform output` there.

This optimization was implemented and released as part of https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.28.3

# Terragrunt command line not working any mroe

**PassionateDeveloper86** commented *Nov 12, 2022*

Hi,

I start to use terragrunt to deploy my azure resource group and my azure kubernetes cluster.
It worked like 10 times, then I tried to play with K8S a bit and saw that my k8s cluster doesnt have access to my container registry (which I set up manuelly before). I played a bit with service accounts in my tf files and from now to then my terragrunt stopped working completly.
Now even when I just want to "terragrunt plan" on my resource group it will look for the k8S state and throw very not googleable messages:

it feels like terragrunt "stucks" or has a bad cache or a bad state file. I cant to anything any more with terragrunt, every command gives this error.

I deleted my state file, now it works again. Seems like a broken state file was the problem.

hi, 
since the error is in failing request to `localhost:80` I suspect K8S credentials weren't fetched - the state may contain a record that K8S access details were fetched and it is not fetched second time

@PassionateDeveloper86 -- We're going to close this issue since it sounds like you got the state sorted out.

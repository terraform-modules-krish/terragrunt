# Terraform Vars Cascade Processing

**Tensho** commented *Jun 4, 2019*

Does it make sense to process `terraform.tfvars` files in **all** parent directories? Consider the next example:
```
prod
  us-east-1
    prod
      mysql
        terraform.tfvars # 1 (particular module level variables)
  terraform.tfvars # 2 (region level variable)
terraform.tfvars # 3 (account level variables)
```
Currently, there is only `find_in_parent_folders()`, which picks the first found `terraform.tfvars` file in the parent directories. In the example above we can merge only 1 and 2. It would be nice to adjust the function or create a new one  (to not break backward compatibility), which would merge 1, 2, and 3.

[People achieve described behavior with the hooks](https://github.com/antonbabenko/terragrunt-reference-architecture/blob/master/acme-prod/terraform.tfvars#L7), but I think that should be in the "core".

Here is a [comment](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/132#issuecomment-280933066) from other thread describing a similar thing.

Supporting multiple includes was intentionally omitted to avoid over-complicating reasoning about the code, how configs are merged, etc. If we can find a simple way to do it in the future, it may be worth doing it. https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/707 adds support for it, but #466 needs to be resolved before any new such features.

FWIW I am looking for this functionality as well. Only allowing a single `terragrunt.hcl` can be very limiting. The scope of what you want to include in the `inputs` block is going to increase as you traverse deeper into the folder structure (global variables -> region variables -> environment variables -> module variables).

This sort of approach doesn't really seem possible at the moment.

@brikis98 Is it still something that correlates with the future Terragrunt plans?

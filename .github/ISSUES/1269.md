# Log postprocessor feature to integrate terragrunt with terraform output processing tools like tfmask

**arbreezy** commented *Jul 29, 2020*

Hello,

This is more a question than an issue.
Is it possible to pipe terragrunt commands to tfmask in order to hide any sensitive date from terraform outputs?

e.g:
`terragrunt plan --terragrunt-non-interactive --terragrunt-source-update -lock=true -lock-timeout=70s -out=./terragrunt.plan | tfmask`
<br />

Not sure. Have you tried it?

I was testing with a previous version of tfmask which wasn't supporting Terraform v12. 
It seems to work fine when adding `terragrunt  apply  -no-color | tfmask`

I also tried to include tfmask in terragrunt hcl ( without -no-color arg) as an extra argument which failed with the below error.

e.g
Terrgrunt configuration  

`terraform {
  extra_arguments "mask_apply" {
    commands = [
      "apply"
    ]
     arguments = [
      "-input=false",
      "-var-file=${path_relative_from_include()}/terraform.tfvars",
       "-lock=true",
      "-lock-timeout=60s",
      " terragrunt.plan",
      " | tfmask"
    ]
  }`

Error message:  
`terragrunt] 2020/07/29 16:04:40 Running command: terraform apply -input=false -var-file=../terraform.tfvars -lock=true -lock-timeout=60s ./terragrunt.plan | tfmask

Good to know!

> `terraform { extra_arguments "mask_apply" { commands = [ "apply" ] arguments = [ "-input=false", "-var-file=${path_relative_from_include()}/terraform.tfvars", "-lock=true", "-lock-timeout=60s", " terragrunt.plan", " | tfmask" ] }`

This won't work. The contents of the `arguments` array is passed to `terraform` as args and NOT executed in a subshell. Therefore, the pipe (`|`) gets passed as an argument to `terraform` (which `terraform` won't recognize or understand) rather than being treated as a redirect by the shell.

This is an interesting use case. It would be nice if terragrunt provided a log postprocessor block that allows you to define a process to stream logs through to before emitting to stdout.

This would be useful for automatically piping outputs through to these kinds of terraform output processors (e.g., `tfmask`, [terraform-landscape](https://github.com/coinbase/terraform-landscape), etc).

From an implementation point of view, it might be good to add in terragrunt hcl file another stanza like `shell_arguments{}` to trigger the postprocessor block.

While intuitive, unfortunately this doesn't quite make sense because we don't call `terraform` in a shell: we directly invoke the binary in a subprocess. This is why I mentioned a "log postprocessor" block, where stdout and stderr is streamed to the stanza.

I'm interested in this feature a loot, I'd like to try to implement it.

Seems like it's possible to connect stdout of cmd, which is used to run terraform to stdin of any other command. 
Config can look like: 
```
terraform {
  
  output_pipe "test" {
    stream = ["stdout", "stderr"]
	 
	commands = [
       "apply",
       "plan",
       "import",
       "push",
       "refresh"
    ]
     
	executable = "tfmask"
	 
	arguments = [ ]
	 
	environment = [] 
  }
```

Thanks for the design suggestion! That looks reasonable. I have a few suggested tweaks:

> stream = ["stdout", "stderr"]

I think this should be a string, with 3 options `stdout` for stdout only, `stderr` for stderr only, or `stdout_and_stderr` for both interleaved.

> 	executable = "tfmask"
>	arguments = [ ]

This should mimic what we currently have for `before_hook` and `after_hook`, which is a single attribute `execute`, which is the list of command + args (e.g., `execute = ["echo", "Foo"]` for `echo Foo`).

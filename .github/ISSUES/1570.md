# Sourcing a bash script to set environment variables in after_hook

**mauriciodou** commented *Mar 3, 2021*

Hello everyone I'm trying to add an after_hook to my Terragrunt configuration in order to run a custom script that fetches secrets and set them as environment variables. I am doing something like this:

```
terraform {
  after_hook "get_secrets" {
    commands = ["terragrunt-read-config"]
    execute      = [
      "/bin/bash",
      "-c",
      "source <(curl -s -L https://${get_env("GITHUB_TOKEN")}@raw.githubusercontent.com/krogertechnology/kps-akv-to-env/main/akv_to_env.sh) ${split("/", get_env("tf_working_dir"))[1]} ${split("/", get_env("GITHUB_REPOSITORY"))[1]}"
    ]
  }
}
```
And the scripts runs correctly but because it runs in a subshell the environment variables set by the script are lost. Is there a way to source the script without spawning a new shell?

Thanks

<br />

If you are asking for a way to modify the environment variable used by terragrunt at runtime, then no there is no way to do this right now. We can consider implementing something to support this, but it needs some design work to think through what that might look like.

# "run-all" enhancement: some way to limit number modules matched for safety

**max-rocket-internet** commented *Jan 18, 2022*

If you have a complex structure with many modules, environments, configurations etc then using `terragrunt run-all` is great to ensure consistency across multiple environments and modules.

The problem we have is that if a user makes a mistake with this command, even when using `--terragrunt-include-dir`, they could accidentally run a command across many more modules/environments than intended, which could be dangerous.

Is there a way to limit this? Like something that says "run-all can only match a maximum of 8 modules"?

I know we can limit the parallelism but this would only slow down a mistake, not stop it ðŸ™‚

Seems reasonable to have a `--terragrunt-limit-run N` option to control how many are run, although that does leave some questions, the big one being how terragrunt decides which N modules to run. I think what you want is some kind of artificial pagination feature: something that gives you a `cursor` back, although that feels fairly complex.

Thinking it through, I'm not sure how much of a gain this really is over the confirmation prompt around the modules to deploy, but I could be wrong. We generally discourage usage of `run-all` on a regular basis due to the many gotchas that surround it (see https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/720#issuecomment-497888756), so it's not something I use often to know what the best interface is.

To give some context, if I run a `run-all` command from the wrong directory, it will match 100s of modules.

I think it would be better to have it in a Terragrunt file? Because then it can't be changed easily or the argument can't be accidentally forgotten.

> although that does leave some questions, the big one being how terragrunt decides which N modules to run

In my mind it wouldn't run anything, it would just count the modules matched and exit with error if it's above the threshold.

That could also work! With a command argument to disable this prompt similar to `-auto-approve` in Terraform.

this is already possible by using the `--terragrunt-strict-include` flag:
```sh
terragrunt run-all plan --terragrunt-strict-include --terragrunt-include-dir "<path>"
```

@dudicoco how does `--terragrunt-strict-include` limit the amount of modules matched if someone makes a mistake with their `path`?

Another approach is to prevent mistakes with paths in the first place.  You could encourage everyone to use a wrapper script that takes arguments such as environment and module, then cd's into the right directory in the 'live' repo.  Something like `run-tf prod vpc` to run the vpc module in production, or `run-tf prod all` to run everything.

This can also make other checks, e.g. prompting the user in production envs.

If you don't want a full wrapper script, you could create a shell function that does the cd part only, which might help avoid mistakes in the `cd` - something like `cdtf prod vpc`. 

I usually use a wrapper script, even with Terragrunt - partly because `run-all` has various gotchas as mentioned, and using it with included directories is so powerful that it can be a foot-gun.

We've already had exactly what you describe here in place for some years already but without Terragrunt. It solves some of the problems, yes, but with organic growth in a large and fast growing environment it gets quickly messy with 100s of people using it. We had to make edits and exception for different shells, docker versions for Windows users, and so on.

The reason we want to use Terragrunt is that for the most part we can leave all of this behind as it's a very elegant solution that solves duplicated code and many TFVAR files in an elegant way.

So for us, to go back to having a shell wrapper on top of a Terraform wrapper is not ideal ðŸ™‚

A simple confirmation like this:

```console
$ terragrunt run-all plan --terragrunt-include-dir "*/*/my-app/"
INFO[0001] The stack at /my/path/terragrunt will be processed in the following order for command plan:
Group 1
- Module /my/path/terragrunt/production/production_ap/my-app
- Module /my/path/terragrunt/production/production_eu/my-app
- Module /my/path/terragrunt/production/production_kr/my-app
- Module /my/path/terragrunt/production/production_kr2/my-app
- Module /my/path/terragrunt/production/production_us/my-app
- Module /my/path/terragrunt/staging/load_tests_eu/my-app
- Module /my/path/terragrunt/staging/staging_eu/my-app

Proceed with running "plan" on these 7 modules? y/n
```

Or something in the terragrunt config file like:

```hcl
terragrunt_version_constraint = "= v0.35.20"
terragrunt_run_all_limit = 8

terraform {
  source = "tfr:///terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws?version=3.5.0"
}

inputs = {
  azs             = ["eu-west-1a", "eu-west-1b", "eu-west-1c"]
  private_subnets = ["10.0.1.0/24", "10.0.2.0/24", "10.0.3.0/24"]
  public_subnets  = ["10.0.101.0/24", "10.0.102.0/24", "10.0.103.0/24"]

  enable_nat_gateway = true
  enable_vpn_gateway = false
}
```

Would work fine ðŸ˜„

I think that part of the issue here is humans running terragrunt/terraform, I highly recommend only letting your CI system run terragrunt which would prevent human errors from occuring, and they will occur with hundreds of people using it.

Running terragrunt locally should be restricted to select individuals with admin permissions in my opinion.

In case this maybe helpful or unknown, one can limit the number of modules that are acted on concurrently using the `--terragrunt-parallelism [number]` flag, [ref](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/execute-terraform-commands-on-multiple-modules-at-once/#limiting-the-module-execution-parallelism).

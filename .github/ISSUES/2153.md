# tfr protocol doesn't work for private terraform cloud registry unknown HTTP error

**davoodharun** commented *Jun 21, 2022*

I have tried to utilize the source parameter in the terraform configuration block to point to a module in a private registry in Terraform Cloud.

```
terraform {
  source = "tfr://app.terraform.io/[organization-name]/[module-name]/azurerm?version=1.0.2"

...
}
```

I am receiving the error
```
error recieving HTTP data


time=2022-06-21T12:53:25-04:00 level=error msg=Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1
```

I have exported the TG_TF_REGISTRY_TOKEN environment variable. I've tried a User API token, Team Token, and Organization Token from Terraform cloud, none of which have worked. 


Am I missing something, or is this scenario not supported yet?

Here is the url that is spit out by the cli: https://app.terraform.io/api/registry/v1/modules/[org-name]/api-apimendpoint/azurerm/1.0.2/download

When I access this in a browser without the /download I get a successful JSON response.


terragrunt version v0.38.0
Terraform v1.1.7

Hi,
I'm not sure how used module is structured, but was used `//` to reference submodule? 

```
tfr://registry.terraform.io/api-apimendpoint//modules/azurerm?version=1.0.2
```

it is not using a submodule 

The url I've set in the .hcl file is in the format
tfr://app.terraform.io/[organization-name]/[module-name]/azurerm?version=1.0.2

from the docs
tfr://REGISTRY_HOST/MODULE_SOURCE?version=VERSION

my registry host is app.terraform.io/[terraform-cloud-organization] and my module name is api-apimendpoint

isn't registry.terraform.io for public modules?

the full url is: tfr://app.terraform.io/exeloncorp/api-apimendpoint/azurerm?version=1.0.2

i've also tried tfr://registry.terraform.io/exeloncorp/api-apimendpoint/azurerm?version=1.0.2 and "tfr://app.terraform.io/api-apimendpoint/azurerm?version=1.0.2"

Facing same problem. Maybe someone has any updates?

I didn't find how to use terraform versioning too. (version = ">= 1.23")

We ran into the `error recieving HTTP data` error due to port exhaustion from our outbound NAT when trying to create hundreds of resources at once. Our NAT was configured to only allow 64 connections to a specific IP/Port, which caused our issue.

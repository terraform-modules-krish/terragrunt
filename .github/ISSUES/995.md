The new Contributing documentation (https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/docs/_docs/03_community/contributing.md) site has a few 404s...
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blame/master/docs/_docs/03_community/contributing.md#L58
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blame/master/docs/_docs/03_community/contributing.md#L58
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blame/master/docs/_docs/03_community/contributing.md#L72

Simple updates to the markdown file will resolve.

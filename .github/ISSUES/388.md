# Terragrunt should detect missing module and provider download errors and automatically re-run init to fix them

**brikis98** commented *Dec 2, 2017*

Terraform has two types of frustrating errors:

1. You add a `module` or modify its version and then next time you run `plan` or `apply`, you get an error that you need to re-run `get`. If Terraform *knows* you need to do that, why doesn't it just do it for you?

1. You run `init` to download the code for providers and get a TLS handshake error or similar timeout. This happens especially often when using `xxx-all` commands, so many downloads are happening concurrently. Not sure if this is a bug in Terraform's download code or throttling on their servers, but I've had many `xxx-all` commands fail because of this.

Terragrunt should detect these errors and retry the previous command automatically.

Adding a second motivation for this issue... I'm running across this when I want to upgrade the version of a provider module I'm using.

We have a `boilerplate.tf` that I symlink into all of my modules that has this clause:

```HCL
provider "azurerm" {
  version = "1.0.0"
}
```

We do this so that we can test and coordinate upgrades of the provider at our leisure rather than having them randomly happen.

Unfortunately, when we update the version to `1.0.1`, `terragrunt plan-all` fails because all of the existing Terragrunt work folders have init-ed 1.0.0 and need to be re-init-ed to get 1.0.1.

A stopgap measure could be to implement a `terragrunt init-all` that allows us to re-run `init` in all the modules the other `-all` commands would run. That might be easier to implement than auto-detection?

ETA: I figured out that adding the `--terragrunt-source-update` flag after `plan-all` provides a workaround for this issue, at least for us who use solely remote tfstate.

`init-all` sounds like a great interim solution! PR very welcome for that :)

Here's one of the timeouts I saw just recently:

```
Failed to load state: RequestError: send request failed

And one more:

```

And two more:

```

One more!

And yet another one that comes up all the time (it's a known Terraform bug that has been ignored for months):

```

Hi @brikis98, thank you for capturing all these errors!

With new releases of Terraform and new added-value services such as [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/) a few new types of errors (or a whole class, rather) has been introduced. I am going capture some of them as follows:

```
Error: Module version requirements have changed

  on main.tf line 10, in module "vpc":
  10:   source  = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"

The version requirements have changed since this module was installed and the
installed version (2.47.0) is no longer acceptable. Run "terraform init" to
install all modules required by this configuration.

[terragrunt] 2020/09/10 11:09:42 Hit multiple errors:

```
```
Error: Could not satisfy plugin requirements


Plugin reinitialization required. Please run "terraform init".

Plugins are external binaries that Terraform uses to access and manipulate
resources. The configuration provided requires plugins which can't be located,
don't satisfy the version constraints, or are otherwise incompatible.

Terraform automatically discovers provider requirements from your
configuration, including providers used in child modules. To see the
requirements and constraints from each module, run "terraform providers".



Error: provider.aws: no suitable version installed
  version requirements: " < 4.0,3.5.0,>= 2.68"

I think this is handled by auto retry now: https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/auto-retry/

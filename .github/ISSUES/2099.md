# Terragrunt with sso profile use wrong setting for s3 backend encryption

**nomopo45** commented *May 10, 2022*

Hello,

Terraform v1.1.5
terragrunt version v0.36.1

This is what my backend look like : 

```
remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  generate = {
    path      = "backend.tf"
    if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  }
  config = {
    bucket = "terraform-state-test"

    key = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    profile        = "sso-profile"
    encrypt        = true
    kms_key_id     = "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:1111111111111:key/daaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaa2-eeaaaaaaaaa"
    s3_bucket_tags = {
      Manage_By = "Terragrunt"
    }
  }
}
```

I'm trying to use a custom kms key for my s3 encryption, but on the first run when the bucket is created the kms key used is the default one (arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:1111111111111:alias/aws/s3) instead of the custom one that i set

when i create the bucket with the same profile through the console management it's working fine and i can use my custom kms key, is it a bug or something i'm missing ?

Thank you
<br />

Hello,
looks like a bug, can you try terragrunt `v0.37.0` which has updates for the KMS keys application

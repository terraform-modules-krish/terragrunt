# Sops decrypt raw file

**sebastianmacarescu** commented *Dec 14, 2021*

According to documentation for sops_decrypt_file: Only YAML and JSON formats are supported by sops_decrypt_file.
It would be really helpful to introduce a "raw" file type like here: https://github.com/carlpett/terraform-provider-sops

This will allow us to store any kind of secrets in our code and be able to push it to AWS SSM with terraform. (eg private ssh keys)

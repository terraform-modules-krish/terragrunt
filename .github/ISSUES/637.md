# Not getting values from optional_var_files

**prandelicious** commented *Jan 15, 2019*

I have terraform.tfvars in the root directory with the following defined:

```hcl
terragrunt = {
  remote_state {
    backend = "s3"
    config {
      bucket         = "my-test-tfstates"
      key            = "v050/${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
      region         = "ap-southeast-1"
      encrypt        = true
      dynamodb_table = "my-dev-terraform-state-lock"

      s3_bucket_tags {
        owner = "terragrunt integration test"
        name  = "Terraform state storage"
      }

      dynamodb_table_tags {
        owner = "terragrunt integration test"
        name  = "Terraform lock table"
      }
    }
  }
  # Configure root level variables that all resources can inherit
  terraform {
    extra_arguments "bucket" {
      commands = ["${get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars()}"]
      optional_var_files = [
          "${get_tfvars_dir()}/${find_in_parent_folders("account.tfvars", ignore")}"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
account.tfvars also live in the same root directory with the following content:
```hcl
# Root level variables that all modules can inherit. This is especially helpful with multi-account configs
# where terraform_remote_state data sources are placed directly into the modules.
tfstate_global_bucket        = "my-test-tfstates"
tfstate_global_bucket_region = "ap-southeast-1"
aws_profile                  = "my-terraformer"
vpc_id                       = "vpc-xxxxxxxxxxxxx"
aws_region                   = "ap-southeast-1"
deploy_env                   = "dev"
internal_domain              = "dev.domain.com"
base_domain                  = "domain.com"
suffix                       = "v050"
```
The first time I ran this, it picked up the `suffix` value which is being used in the Terraform config. The second and third time I ran it, the Terraform config doesn't appear to be picking up the `suffix` value anymore.

Why do you say that?

My bad, sorry. Someone messed up with the module I was using hence it was not picking up the value. Kindly close this ticket.

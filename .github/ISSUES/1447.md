# Error: Error building ARM Config: obtain subscription() from Azure CLI: Error parsing json result from the Azure CLI: Error waiting for the Azure CLI: exit status 1

Hello I have this `terragrunt.hcl` file on the root on the project and when applying `terragrunt plan-all` it goes to all .cache folders.

This provider logs in in into azure using Service Principal (https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/guides/service_principal_client_secret). 

```
remote_state {
  backend = "azurerm"
  generate = {
    path      = "backend.tf"
    if_exists = "overwrite"
  }
  config = {
    resource_group_name  = "dev-remote-state"
    storage_account_name = "devterraform"
    container_name       = "tfstate"
    key                  = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
  }
}

generate "provider" {
  path = "provider.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  contents = <<EOF
# Configure Terraform
terraform {
  required_version = "= 0.13.5"
}

# Configure the Azure Provider
provider "azurerm" {
  # Whilst version is optional, we /strongly recommend/ using it to pin the version of the Provider being used
  version = "= 2.38.0"
  # Create a file "secrets.tfvars" with the following fields. More info here: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/guides/service_principal_client_secret
  subscription_id = "00000000-0000-0000-00000000"
  client_id            = "00000000-0000-0000-00000000" 
  client_secret     = "password"
  tenant_id          = "00000000-0000-0000-00000000"
  features {}
}
EOF
}
```

But when applying it I get the following error: 

```
Initializing the backend...

Error: Error building ARM Config: obtain subscription() from Azure CLI: Error parsing json result from the Azure CLI: Error waiting for the Azure CLI: exit status 1



[terragrunt] 2020/11/27 15:04:22 Encountered the following errors:
Hit multiple errors:
exit status 1
```

If I place the provider inside Terraform it works fine. 

Am I missing something??

Terraform version: v0.13.5
Terragrunt version: v0.26.4

Terragrunt doesn't do anything directly related to Azure AFAIK, so this seems like a Terraform / Azure issue, and not a Terragrunt one. Note that since you're using `generator` to  generate  code, you can go into `.terragrunt-cache/.../<YOUR MODULE>` and run `terraform` commands directly in that folder to take Terragrunt completely out of the equation.

Hi @judaondo,
I had also encountered this error message:
**Error: Error building ARM Config: obtain subscription() from Azure CLI: Error parsing json result from the Azure CLI: Error waiting for the Azure CLI: exit status 1**

and can confirm that it does not depend on Terragrunt.
I solved it this way:

1. Upgraded terraform (0.14.3) and Terragrunt (0.26.7)
2. Updated azure-cli to the latest version
3. I logged in as follows: az login -u _username_ -p _pwd_.

In my case, it was just an authentication problem.
I think it was because Terragrunt was not able to decipher the authentication failed message that was displayed correctly by terraform.
To test this, go to the folder mentioned by @brikis98 and run a terraform plan directly and then check the message you obtain.

@judaondo @Sampy84 

The below solution works: (Please note that the terraform version being used is 0.14.6, and terragrunt version is 0.27.0)

terragrunt.hcl
```
generate "provider" {
  path      = "_provider.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite"
  contents  = <<EOF

provider "azurerm" {
  features {

  }
}

EOF
}

remote_state {
  backend = "azurerm"

  disable_init = tobool(get_env("TERRAGRUNT_DISABLE_INIT", "false"))

  generate = {
    path      = "_backend.tf"
    if_exists = "overwrite"
  }

  config = {
    resource_group_name  = "eso-sandbox-rg"
    storage_account_name = "esosbxtfbackend"
    container_name       = "tfstate"
    key                  = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
  }
}
```

And, my github workflow:
```
  sandbox-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [build]
    if: ${{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/master' }}
    environment:
      name: Sandbox
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Terraform
        uses: autero1/action-terraform@v0.1.0
        with:
          terraform_version: 0.14.6
      - name: Setup Terragrunt
        uses: autero1/action-terragrunt@v1.0.0
        with:
          terragrunt_version: 0.27.0
      - name: Export Azure Login Credentials
        run: |
          echo "ARM_CLIENT_ID=${{ secrets.CLIENT_ID }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV
          echo "ARM_CLIENT_SECRET=${{ secrets.CLIENT_SECRET }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV
          echo "ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=${{ secrets.SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV
          echo "ARM_TENANT_ID=${{ secrets.TENANT_ID }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV
      - name: Create Execution Plan
        run: terragrunt plan-all
      - name: Apply Changes
        run: yes | terragrunt apply-all
```

Closing this as the original question has been answered. If there are any follow ups, please open a new ticket with updated context. Thanks!

For me at least, the above solves the problem by changing the authentication mechanism which was not desirable. The root cause lied in ambiguous error, it wasn't the `provider` but the `backend` which was missing the required vars as explained here.

https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/issues/8376#issuecomment-689942915

As pointed out by others, not Terragrunt issue, but hope this post may help someone.

# Feature Request - Error paths in console jump to file in editor when clicked

**calebplum** commented *Jul 17, 2021*

Often when I'm debugging lots of files at once it can be hard to quickly determine which file an error relates to, especially with long file paths that are often very similar to each other. I was thinking about whether it would it be possible to hyperlink the file name in the terminal to jump to the file in vscode (or another configurable editor)?

If I have the file's directory open in vscode I can jump to it by running `code filepath/terragrunt.hcl` in a terminal.

A few terminals [even do](https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda) support hyperlinks apparently, including gnome-terminal, iTerm2, tmux and others.

As a bonus, the link could even go to error's the line number. You can do this with `code -g filepath/terragrunt.hcl:5`.

What are your thoughts on a feature like this?

It seems like a great idea, but how do you actually implement it?

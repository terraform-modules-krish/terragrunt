# Backend encryption is broken

### terraform.tfvars
```
terragrunt = {
  remote_state {
    backend = "s3"
    config {
      bucket     = "example"
      encrypt = true
      key        = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
      lock_table = "example"
      profile     = "example"
      region     = "us-west-1"
    }
  }
}
```

 and the output is:
```

Ah, another good catch. We used to use strings for all remote state configuration. Looks like the `backend` section in Terraform 0.9 uses proper types, including booleans for the `encrypt` param. Fixing coming shortly :)

Should be fixed by #181. Available shortly here: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.12.6

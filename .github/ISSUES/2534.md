# terragrunt 'path_relative_to_include' issue

**Stragavanza** commented *Apr 17, 2023*

Hello.

I have an issue with terragrunt. After terragrunt plan or apply, at .terragrunt-cache _backend.tf contains this key:
key = "../../../../../home/username/something/layers/terraform.tfstate"
instead of 
key = layers/terraform.tfstate which is expected, because remote state and lock uses path_relative_to_include:
key = "${path_relative_to_include()}

It causes that when i run terragrunt plan or apply, it want to recreate all of resources regardless of whether it exists or not.

My environment: WSL 2 Ubuntu (22.04.2 LTS)

I reinstalled it, and tried with different versions.
I tried to run with terragrunt-log-level debug --terragrunt-debug.

If you need any further information, just comment, thank you very much
<br />

Hi,
I wanted to confirm key value is `key = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"` or `key = "${path_relative_to_include()}"` ?

```
key = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate}"
```

I suspect it may be because of WSL, if will be used Terragrunt native Windows executable, the same issue happens?

Seeing the same error in Mac, exactly the same code works OK in WSL. Tried with versions 0.43.2 and 0.48.0

```
remote_state {
  backend = "gcs"

  config = {
    bucket = "bucket-name"
    prefix = "environment/${path_relative_to_include()}"
  }
}
```

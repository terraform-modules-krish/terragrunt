# Question on how after_hook execute access to environment variable

**BAu0002** commented *Aug 5, 2022*

I'm trying to run a simple execute that acquire the environment variable

after_hook "setvariable" {
    commands    = ["plan"]
    execute     = ["export", "PROPERTY_ID='1'"]
 }

after_hook "getEnvironment" {
    commands    = ["plan"]
    execute     = ["env"]
 }

after_hook "run" {
    commands    = ["plan"]
    execute     = ["echo", "$PROPERTY_ID"]
 }

getEnvironment hook show that environment variable has been set.
run hook just out put $PROPERTY_ID.   The variable not being resolved.   

Can terragrunt execute resolve environment variables?

Hi,
AFAIK each `execute` is invoked individually and exported environment variables will not be passed to the next steps

Your statement does not explain why 'env' command will show the set environment variable.

I'm going to make a guess that execute is running in some kind of shell that does not work with variables.

I've worked around the issue by having one step install results to a file and second step to run a bash script that read the file.

# Dependency to terraform resouce

**arik-porat** commented *Sep 13, 2020*

Hi,
How can I create a dependency to a resource that is created with a terraform?
for example 

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "athena-query-result" {
  bucket = "aws-athena-query-results-123456789012-${var.aws_region}"
}

I would like create a dependency on this in different module
inputs = {
  name = "test"
  bucket  =  aws_s3_bucket.athena-query-result.arn
...
}

<br />

This has been asked many times and is covered in the docs. See [`dependency` blocks](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/execute-terraform-commands-on-multiple-modules-at-once/#passing-outputs-between-modules) and [`terraform_remote_state`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/terraform/d/remote_state.html) for two possible approaches.

# aws_vpc_endpoint.endpoint1: : invalid or unknown key: tags

**divakardevops** commented *Oct 8, 2021*

https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/vpc_endpoint - Trying to create vpc endpoint and tag with name. But tags is not working.

Could some help?

Listed the versions from my environment.

terragrunt - v0.13.23
terraform - v0.11.3
aws provider version - 2.7

Thanks & Regards,
Divakar

It's a bit hard to help without seeing any code. Can you share your terraform `tf` files and `terraform.tfvars` code?

Also, please be advised that support for terraform 0.11.x is limited, so if there is a bug, you will most likely have to fork or upgrade.

```
provider "aws" {
   region = "${var.aws_region}"
   profile = "${var.aws_profile}"
   shared_credentials_file = "${pathexpand("~/.aws/credentials")}"
   version = "2.7"
}

terraform {
  backend "s3" {}
}

resource "aws_vpc_endpoint" "endpoint1" {
  vpc_id            = "${var.vpc}"
  service_name      = "${var.service_name}"
  vpc_endpoint_type = "Interface"

  tags = {
    Environment = "test"
  }

  security_group_ids = [
    "${data.aws_security_group.sg.id}"
  ]

  private_dns_enabled = true
}


data "aws_security_group" "sg" {
  name = "${var.security_group_name}"
}

```

Given my tf file above and below is the output i receive

Thanks for the code. This is actually not a terragrunt issue, but rather an issue with your terraform module. `aws_vpc_endpoint` did not support `tags` until [aws provider version 2.35.0](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/blob/v2.70.0/CHANGELOG.md#2350-november-07-2019), but you are version locked to provider version 2.7.0.

Closing as the issue is not with Terragrunt.

# Add a terragrunt-debug command

**brikis98** commented *Apr 2, 2020*

Add a new `terragrunt terragrunt-debug` command that can help debug Terragrunt issues. It would do the following:

1. Enable debug logging
1. Generate a `terraform.tfvars` file with all the variables in the `inputs = { ... }` block.
1. Print all the variables, and if possible, where they were read from, to `stderr` so they user can see them directly. 
1. Print other diagnostic info to `stderr`: Terragrunt version, Terraform version, file paths, etc.
1. Print the path to the working dir. This is often something convoluted like `.terragrunt-cache/xxx/yyy/<repo>/<your module>`, so being able to see it easily, and know that there is a `terraform.tfvars` file sitting in that folder will allow you to run `terraform` directly in that folder. This helps diagnose issues that are in Terraform itself, rather than Terragrunt.

Other ideas for what would help debug Terragrunt issues are welcome!

You should be able to achieve this with hooks, but requires a bit of setup -- would be nice to trivially see what inputs were passed to a module when errors like "Error: Invalid value for module argument" arise.

This is implemented now https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/debugging/

@yorinasub17 but `--terragrunt-debug` doesn't work.

I execute `terragrunt  apply-all --terragrunt-debug` but don't see `terragrunt-debug.tfvars.json` file.

```
terragrunt version v0.27.1
Terraform v0.14.4
```

The current implementation of debug does not work with `xxx-all` commands. They are intended to be used with single modules. We should have a new ticket for supporting `xxx-all` debug though. I updated https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1502 to reflect that.

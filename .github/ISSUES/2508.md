# Destroy command failing to find file when using dependency

**jtyr** commented *Mar 31, 2023*

I have the following setup:

```text
├── terraform
│   ├── envs
│   │   └── dev
│   │       ├── base
│   │       │   └── main.tf
│   │       └── cluster
│   │           └── main.tf
│   └── states

└── terragrunt
    ├── envs
    │   └── dev
    │       ├── base
    │       │   ├── terragrunt.hcl
    │       │   └── tier.hcl
    │       ├── cluster
    │       │   ├── terragrunt.hcl
    │       │   └── tier.hcl
    │       └── env.hcl
    ├── org.hcl
    └── terragrunt.hcl
```

Where the files content is as follows:

```hcl
# terraform/envs/dev/base/main.tf      
output "some_output" {
  value = "something"
}
```
```hcl
# terraform/envs/dev/cluster/main.tf 
variable "some_input" {}

output "some_output" {
  value = "${var.some_input} else"
}
```
```hcl
# terragrunt/envs/dev/base/terragrunt.hcl    
terraform {
  source = "../../../../terraform//envs/dev/base"
}

include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}
```
```hcl
# terragrunt/envs/dev/cluster/terragrunt.hcl 
terraform {
  source = "../../../../terraform//envs/dev/cluster"
}

include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

dependency "base" {
  config_path = "../base"
}

inputs = {
  some_input = dependency.base.outputs.some_output
}
```
```hcl
# terragrunt/terragrunt.hcl                  
locals {
  org_vars = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("org.hcl"))
  env_vars = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("env.hcl"))
  tier_vars = read_terragrunt_config("tier.hcl")

  organization_unit = local.org_vars.locals.organization_unit
  environment       = local.env_vars.locals.environment
  tier              = local.tier_vars.locals.tier
}

generate "provider" {
  path      = "terraform.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  contents  = <<-EOF
    terraform {
      backend "local" {
        path = "../../../../../../../../../../terraform/states/${local.environment}-${local.tier}.state"
      }
    }
    EOF
}

inputs = merge(
  local.org_vars.locals,
  local.env_vars.locals,
  local.tier_vars.locals,
)
```
```hcl
# terragrunt/envs/dev/base/tier.hcl    
locals {
  tier = "base"
}
```
```hcl
# terragrunt/envs/dev/cluster/tier.hcl       
locals {
  tier = "cluster"
}
```
```hcl
# terragrunt/envs/dev/env.hcl       
locals {
  environment = "dev"
}
```
```hcl
# terragrunt/org.hcl          
locals {
  organization_unit = "test"
}
```

When I run `terragrunt apply` from the `terragrunt/envs/dev/base` directory and then from the `terragrunt/envs/dev/cluster` directory, all works just fine. But once I run `terragrunt destroy` from the `terragrunt/envs/dev/cluster` directory, I get an error the it cannot find files used in the included `terragrunt.hcl` but the destruction works just fine:

```text

Initializing the backend...

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

But if I comment out the `dependency` related blocks from the `terragrunt/envs/dev/cluster/terragrunt.hcl` file:

```hcl
terraform {
  source = "../../../../terraform//envs/dev/cluster"
}

include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

#dependency "base" {
#  config_path = "../base"
#}

inputs = {
  #some_input = dependency.base.outputs.some_output
  some_input = "something"
}
```

the `terragrunt destroy` command is showing no error:

```text

It looks like when the `dependency` is used, it somehow evaluates the `destroy` command from the perspective of the included `terragrunt.hcl` file instead of from the perspective of the root `terragrunt.hcl` file.

I tried to use the Terragrunt built-in functions (e.g. `get_terragrunt_dir`, `get_parent_terragrunt_dir`, `get_original_terragrunt_dir`,  `path_relative_to_include`,  `path_relative_from_include`) in the paths specified in the `terraform` and `dependency` blocks but nothing really helped.

This issue is similar to #2330 and #1891 with the difference that I don't specify the `--terragrunt-working-dir` at all as I run the commands directly from the root module.

I'm seeing exact same behaviour.
```
terragrunt --version
terragrunt version v0.45.0

terraform --version
Terraform v1.3.0
on darwin_arm64```

Hi @jtyr 

Thank you for the detailed explanation, it was really helpful. 
Issue resolved in [v0.45.17](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.45.17)  release.

You also need to update the config file.
```hcl
# terragrunt/terragrunt.hcl        
locals {
  org_vars = read_terragrunt_config("${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/org.hcl")
  env_vars = read_terragrunt_config("${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/envs/dev/env.hcl")
  tier_vars = read_terragrunt_config("tier.hcl")
  ...
}
...
```

Good luck!

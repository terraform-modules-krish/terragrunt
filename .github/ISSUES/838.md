# Terragrunt always reinitializes state if TF_DATA_DIR is specified

**misha-ridge** commented *Aug 16, 2019*

Terragrunt does not know that `terraform.tfstate` can be stored in a path specified in `TF_DATA_DIR` environment variable, and that causes it to call `terraform init` every time.

How to reproduce:

```
TF_DATA_DIR=somewhere terragrunt plan
TF_DATA_DIR=somewhere terragrunt plan
```

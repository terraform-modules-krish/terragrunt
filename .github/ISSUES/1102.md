# Generated backend.tf "region" place is random

**magnetik** commented *Mar 26, 2020*

In my terragrunt.hcl I have:

```
remote_state {
  backend = "s3"

  generate = {
    path = "backend.tf"
    if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  }

  config = {
    bucket = "states"
    key = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "eu-west-1"
    profile = "my-profile"
    encrypt = false
  }
}
```

When running terragrunt, the generated backend.tf is sometimes:
```
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket  = "states"
    encrypt = false
    key     = "eu-west-1/route53-zones/terraform.tfstate"
    profile = "my-profile"
    region  = "eu-west-1"
  }
}
```
and sometimes:
```
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    encrypt = false
    key     = "eu-west-1/route53-zones/terraform.tfstate"
    profile = "my-profile"
    region  = "eu-west-1"
    bucket  = "states"
  }
}
```

Note that the place of region changed.
It's quite annoying if you want to keep track of this.

Can this be set once for all?

Thanks.

I actually wouldn't recommend keeping track of terragrunt generated files in source control, and should rely on terragrunt to generate all the time. Can you describe your use case for wanting to track it (I might be missing something)?

In any case, a PR to fix that would be welcome. The fix would be to update the for loop here to iterate in key sorted order: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/6c304f91690badae3c2d64bf5b2c98d38368621e/codegen/generate.go#L147

Hey, thanks for he fast response. 

No particular reason, the file was just there, and I didn't see any reason why not adding it. 
It's perhaps more obvious when browsing the repository (?), and make it more obvious that something has changed during the generation.

I'm not really convinced that it should be in source control. 

I know nothing of go, but I'll try something in the coming days. 

Thanks again.

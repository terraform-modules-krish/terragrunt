# Allow the .terraform-lock.hcl to be read-only

**gercograndia** commented *May 24, 2023*

**Describe the solution you'd like**
We are re-using terragrunt modules in various projects, so when we deploy a (set of) module(s) we sync the terragrunt.hcl and .terraform-lock.hcl from our 'platform' repo. Both files should be leading in this platform repo, and will be overwritten at a new release.

It is possible that a lock file is inadvertenly upgraded in a particular project and hence becomes reliant on a newer version than the platform, with all kinds of issues.

To avoid that, we'd like to make the .terragrunt-lock.hcl read-only in the project deployments.

However, upon init or first plan (assuming the .terragrunt-cache is cleaned up) this leads to an error: `my-module/.terraform.lock.hcl: permission denied`. Upon next plan, this works fine.

Presumably this is [because terragrunt is copying back the lock file from the cache dir to the module dir](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/lock-file-handling/#how-terragrunt-solves-this-problem) so it can be checked in.

It would be nice if we could opt-out of this copy-back behaviour. Or perhaps if terragrunt only copies back when there are changes in the lock file.

> Actually, if terraform wants to update the lock file, this would already result in an error when this file is read-only.

**Additional context**
terragrunt is all about Don't Repeat Yourself, and when we adopted it we considered the terragrunt.hcl files as simple configurations. However, in large projects, with lots of modules (and hence dependencies) it quickly turned out that there is quite some logic in the terragrunt.hcl files that you want to re-use.

Hence we also standardised our terragrunt files, similar to how we deal with the terraform modules.

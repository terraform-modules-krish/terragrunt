# Incorrect Usage. flag provided but not defined: -terragrunt-iam-role

**Erazihel** commented *Nov 7, 2017*

As mentioned by the [documentation](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt#configuring-terragrunt-to-assume-an-iam-role), the following command should work:

```bash
terragrunt --terragrunt-iam-role "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/ROLE_NAME" apply
```

Unfortunately, Terragrunt throws the following error:

```
Incorrect Usage. flag provided but not defined: -terragrunt-iam-role

DESCRIPTION:
   terragrunt - Terragrunt is a thin wrapper for Terraform that provides extra tools for working with multiple
   Terraform modules, remote state, and locking. For documentation, see https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/.

USAGE:
   terragrunt <COMMAND>

COMMANDS:
   plan-all             Display the plans of a 'stack' by running 'terragrunt plan' in each subfolder
   apply-all            Apply a 'stack' by running 'terragrunt apply' in each subfolder
   output-all           Display the outputs of a 'stack' by running 'terragrunt output' in each subfolder
   destroy-all          Destroy a 'stack' by running 'terragrunt destroy' in each subfolder
   validate-all         Validate 'stack' by running 'terragrunt validate' in each subfolder
   *                    Terragrunt forwards all other commands directly to Terraform

GLOBAL OPTIONS:
   terragrunt-config                    Path to the Terragrunt config file. Default is terraform.tfvars.
   terragrunt-tfpath                    Path to the Terraform binary. Default is terraform (on PATH).
   terragrunt-no-auto-init              Don't automatically run 'terraform init' during other terragrunt commands. You must run 'terragrunt init' manually.
   terragrunt-non-interactive           Assume "yes" for all prompts.
   terragrunt-working-dir               The path to the Terraform templates. Default is current directory.
   terragrunt-source                    Download Terraform configurations from the specified source into a temporary folder, and run Terraform in that temporary folder.
   terragrunt-source-update             Delete the contents of the temporary folder to clear out any old, cached source code before downloading new source code into it.
   terragrunt-ignore-dependency-errors  *-all commands continue processing components even if a dependency fails.

```

However, providing the argument after the `apply` works fine:

```bash
terragrunt apply --terragrunt-iam-role "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/ROLE_NAME"
```

```

Thanks for the bug report. Definitely some sort of argument parsing issue.

The workaround for now is to pass the `--terragrunt-iam-role` param *after* the `apply` command.

Sounds related to https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16829.

Hello,

This does not work for the below version, so it's still an issue as per the OP:

```
bash-5.0$ terragrunt --version
terragrunt version v0.23.12

terragrunt --terragrunt-iam-role "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/ROLE_NAME" apply

[terragrunt] 2020/05/01 16:55:35 flag provided but not defined: -terragrunt-iam-role
[terragrunt] 2020/05/01 16:55:35 Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1
```

This suggests it works this way around:

```
bash-5.0$ terragrunt apply --terragrunt-iam-role "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/ROLE_NAME"
...
[terragrunt] 2020/05/01 16:57:45 Assuming IAM role arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/ROLE_NAME
```

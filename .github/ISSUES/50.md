# [Feature Suggestion] Lock on terraform plan

**mechastorm** commented *Nov 14, 2016*

Great tool here! Helps solves my team's issue with state conflicts while we figure out our long term solution.

I was wondering if it makes sense to optionally lock at the "terraform plan" stage instead of apply? From what I understood in terragrunt, the locking is only at the "apply" stage (which is great).

The terraform workflow I've been following is
1. `terraform plan` and output a plan file
2. Get a peer review on the plan and approve it if needed
3. `terraform apply` against the plan file

So in general, we always ran "terraform apply" against a plan file.

At a previous organisation, we had a bespoke solution where we locked the state file when we begin "plan" stage. That meant that
- no one can change (apply) the infrastructure until that plan has been applied or the user released the lock for that plan. 
- other users can still run plan but when they apply their changes on a locked state, they will be prompetd to wait for that other plan to be run and re-run their plan against the new changes
- the user's plan is going to be applied against a state that did not change during the peer review period. There is no chance between the "plan" and "apply" stage that the infrastructure got changed by someone else.

Any thoughts?

We've had a few requests for long-term locks. Probably the best way to handle it is with a `terragrunt lock` command. It should be pretty easy to add. Are you interested in submitting a PR? 

In the meantime, I'm going to close this issue in favor of #19, since it's more or less a dupe, and I'd like to consolidate the conversation in one place.

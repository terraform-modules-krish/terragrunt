# Feature request: Add marker with module name when running a `run-all` task

**syphernl** commented *Jan 31, 2023*

Currently, when running a `run-all` command (e.g. `terragrunt run-all plan`) it is not very clear as to what module Terragrunt is operating in. 
It would be nice if it could add a (preferably colored) sentence such as:

```bash
* Terragrunt: Running task in module foo/bar
.....
No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.
```

Another option, would be to add colored prefixes to each line, I think packer does that.

A fix for this has been implemented by https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.45.1 and can be closed.

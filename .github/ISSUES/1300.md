# Hooks should pass through success or error state

**JeanFred** commented *Aug 17, 2020*

Terragrunt’s [before and after_hooks](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/before-and-after-hooks/) can be configured to `run_on_error` (or not). I would like to pass through whether there was an error on not.

My use case is to notify a webhook of failed/successful applies − I now have an `after_hook` which executes a small Shell script which sends a curl to the webhook. I would like the event to be different whether terragrunt succeeds and fails.

As I can map out anything in the Shell script,  far as I’m concerned, this could be done through an environment variable / 'magic' argument containing a string (`SUCCESS`/`FAILURE`), an integer (0/1) or relaying the underlying return code of terraform itself.

Seems like it could be a useful feature. That said, more thought is required on how this would work. 

- The exit code would probably the most useful piece of info... But do you want the exit code of just Terraform? Or Terragrunt (in case it hit an error separate from Terraform)? Or all previous hooks that ran?
- Passing it via CLI arg would probably break some scripts that aren't expecting that arg, so I'm guessing env vars are the way to go.

If someone wants to flush out the design fully and submit a PR, that is very welcome!

Instead of this can we do `run_only_on_error`

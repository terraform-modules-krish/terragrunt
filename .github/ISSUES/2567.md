# Provide a clear error message when the terraform binary doesn't exist.

**jlepere-everlaw** commented *May 15, 2023*

**Describe the solution you'd like**
It would be nice if `terragrunt` could provide a clean error message when the `terraform` binary does not exist.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I've considered adding a [`before_hook`](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/hooks/) calling a custom script to ensure the `terraform` binary exists. The downside of this approach is that it would entail a fair amount of boilerplate. 

**Additional context**
n/a

Hi, 
can be shared logs on how Terraform is failing?

In my tests, if Terraform is not available, the message below is printed:
```
$ terragrunt apply 
ERRO[0000] exec: "terraform": executable file not found in $PATH 
ERRO[0000] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1 
```
Maybe it is OS-specific, I tested on Ubuntu.

Ah, sorry. We have a custom `terraform` wrapper to do some stuff before invoking `terraform`. When using `terraform` directly (not our wrapper), I'm able to see the above output. I think we can chalk this up to something on our end. If I can find a workaround that's worth sharing, I'll post here.

Hi,
seems to be an issue with downloaded modules by Terraform, it is happening each time? or after cache clean it start to work?

It actually happens every time and I even tried to change the version, clear the current workspace cache, uninstall both terraform and terragrunt, and reinstalled it but nothing helps.

But when I tried "terraform init" with terraform codebase it worked without any issue.

This happens for us when you use `TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR`.  Terraform's docs provide this note:
> Note: The plugin cache directory is not guaranteed to be concurrency safe. The provider installer's behavior in environments with multiple terraform init calls is undefined.

When you run `terragrunt run-all init` or let terragrunt auto init, this causes issues when multiple terraform runs try to populate the cache simultaneously.  We wrote our own initialization script to optimize/serialize the init process to overcome this.  If you don't have that many terraform repos you're trying to initialize, you could use `--terragrunt-parallelism=1` to init everything first serially.  It's only populating the cache that causes problems.  Once it is populated, we've never had issues with lots of parallelism just reading from their cache.

See issue #1212 for additional discussion, assuming this is what is hitting you.

@tjstansell can you share the initialization script you mention or a general idea of how you are doing this? We have hundreds of Terragrunt files and using `TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR` with Atlantis has only generated issues for us.

Thank you in advance!

Our script recursively scans for any `.tf` or `.hcl` files, then does a best effort parsing of them line-by-line to look for provider definitions.  We also pre-install a bunch of our common providers directly into our image as a mirror location. 
 So, it includes all of those as well to make sure they get pre-cached. Then, in the end, it creates a `precache` directory with a `providers.tf` with all of the providers listed and runs `terraform init` on that one directory.  This effectively serializes the provider install.  We don't have repos with conflicting provider version requirements or anything like that, so it works for us.  But in theory, you could do the same thing in groups if you have multiple versions of a provider that needs to get cached.

@tjstansell thank you you gave me some ideas!

# Module from git with subpath does not download provider

**b-twis** commented *May 21, 2020*

Hi All,

I have an issue where the provder plugin is not installed when running terraform source using git with a sub path. 
 
terragrunt version v0.23.18
Terraform v0.12.25

I have based the sample project off https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example but switching to Azure as the provider. 


```
locals {
  # Automatically load environment-level variables
  environment_vars = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("env.hcl"))
  subscription_vars = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("subscription.hcl"))
}

# Terragrunt will copy the Terraform configurations specified by the source parameter, along with any files in the
# working directory, into a temporary folder, and execute your Terraform commands in that folder.
terraform {
  source = "git::https://<user>@dev.azure.com/<repo_path>?ref=v0.1.0"
  #source = "git::https://<user>@dev.azure.com/<repo_path>//components/ui?ref=v0.1.0"
}

# Include all settings from the root terragrunt.hcl file
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

# These are the variables we have to pass in to use the module specified in the terragrunt configuration above
inputs = {
  location = "westeurope"
  prefix                = local.environment_vars.locals.environment
  resourcegroup_name    = local.environment_vars.locals.resourcegroup_name
}

```



The following are outputs of 
`terragrunt init --terragrunt-source-update`



No Sub path to module
source = "git::https://<user>@dev.azure.com/<repo_path>?ref=v0.1.0"
```
Initializing the backend...

Successfully configured the backend "azurerm"! Terraform will automatically
use this backend unless the backend configuration changes.

Initializing provider plugins...
- Checking for available provider plugins...
- Downloading plugin for provider "azurerm" (hashicorp/azurerm) 2.10.0...

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```
 

With sub path to module
source = "git::https://<user>@dev.azure.com/<repo_path>//components/ui?ref=v0.1.0"
```
Initializing the backend...

Successfully configured the backend "azurerm"! Terraform will automatically
use this backend unless the backend configuration changes.

Initializing provider plugins...
- Checking for available provider plugins...
- Downloading plugin for provider "azurerm" (hashicorp/azurerm) 2.10.0...

Error installing provider "azurerm": open .terraform\plugins\windows_amd64\terraform-provider-azurerm_v2.10.0_x5.exe: The system cannot find the path specified..


Terraform analyses the configuration and state and automatically downloads
plugins for the providers used. However, when attempting to download this
plugin an unexpected error occurred.

This may be caused if for some reason Terraform is unable to reach the
plugin repository. The repository may be unreachable if access is blocked
by a firewall.

If automatic installation is not possible or desirable in your environment,
you may alternatively manually install plugins by downloading a suitable
distribution package and placing the plugin's executable file in the
following directory:
    terraform.d/plugins/windows_amd64


Error: open .terraform\plugins\windows_amd64\terraform-provider-azurerm_v2.10.0_x5.exe: The system cannot find the path specified.


[terragrunt] 2020/05/21 10:29:33 Hit multiple errors:
exit status 1
```


I tested using a terraform init on a main.tf with the module source path and it is working as expected. 
source = "git::https://<user>@dev.azure.com/<repo_path>//components/ui?ref=v0.1.0"

Thanks in advance.

Windows has path limitations, see https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/581#issuecomment-460051767. Try exporting `$env:TERRAGRUNT_DOWNLOAD = "C:\.terragrunt-cache"` and see if that helps (that's powershell syntax, adjust for your windows shell of choice).

# add ability to override "terragrunt-download" directory name

**tamsky** commented *Mar 1, 2017*

Currently
```
	downloadDir := util.JoinPath(os.TempDir(), "terragrunt-download", encodedWorkingDir, rootPath)
```

In a multi-user environment this can cause permissions problems.

It would be helpful to be able to declare a per-UID path component instead of the fixed `terragrunt-download` string.

Perhaps an ENV var?

Good point.

A UID is a reasonable idea, but easy to forget. It would be nice to find an option that works automatically. Some ideas:

* Does everyone in the shared environment use different OS users? If so, the username could be inserted in the path to resolve this automatically. 

* Does ever everyone in the shared environment use different AWS credentials? If so, the AWS user id could be inserted in the path to resolve this automatically.

* What about claiming the DynamoDB lock *before* downloading the source? Then, if two users are on the same computer, one of them will get a lock and the other will have to wait.

Yes. This.

Different users create directories in /tmp that other users cannot delete or update.

Appending `$USER` would seem to be the most straightforward way to avoid sharing a directory in `/tmp`.

I'm open to a PR for any of those 3 options :)

# Best practices for vpc peering

**dudicoco** commented *Jun 14, 2020*

Hi,

While breaking my head over trying to accomplish vpc peering, with support for cross region and cross account and without hard coding within the terraform module but only using terragrunt dependencies, i've come up with the following:

```
# peering requester terragrunt.hcl

terraform {
  source = ../modules/vpc-peering-requester"
}

dependency "vpc" {
  config_path  = "../vpc1"

  mock_outputs = {
    vpc_id = "known after apply"
    private_route_table_id = "known after apply"
  }
}

dependency "vpc-peer" {
  config_path  = "../vpc2"

  mock_outputs = {
    vpc_id = "known after apply"
    vpc_owner_id = "known after apply"
    vpc_region = "known after apply"
    vpc_cidr_block = "known after apply"
  }
}

inputs = {
  vpc_id = dependency.vpc.outputs.vpc_id
  route_table_id = dependency.vpc.outputs.private_route_table_id
  peer_vpc_id = dependency.vpc-peer.outputs.vpc_id
  peer_vpc_owner_id = dependency.vpc-peer.outputs.vpc_owner_id
  peer_vpc_region = dependency.vpc-peer.outputs.vpc_region
  peer_vpc_cidr_block = dependency.vpc-peer.outputs.vpc_cidr_block
}

include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}
```

```
# peering accepter terragrunt.hcl

terraform {
  source = "../modules/vpc-peering-accepter"
}

dependency "vpc" {
  config_path  = "../vpc2"

  mock_outputs = {
    private_route_table_id = "known after apply"
  }
}

dependency "vpc-peer" {
  config_path  = "../vpc1"

  mock_outputs = {
    vpc_cidr_block = "known after apply"
  }
}

dependency "vpc-peering-requester" {
  config_path  = "../vpc-peering-requester-vpc1-vpc2"

  mock_outputs = {
    vpc_peering_connection_id = "known after apply"
  }
}

inputs = {
  vpc_peering_connection_id = dependency.vpc-peering-requester.outputs.vpc_peering_connection_id
  route_table_id = dependency.vpc.outputs.private_route_table_id
  peer_vpc_cidr_block = dependency.vpc-peer.outputs.vpc_cidr_block
}

include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}
```

The two terragrunt.hcl files above do the following:
1. Requester is dependent on both vpcs and creates the peering connection request, and adds a route to vpc2 within the vpc1 route table.
1. Accepter is dependent on both vpcs and the peering requester and accepts the peering connection request, and adds a route to vpc1 within the vpc2 route table.

Is there a better way to achieve this using terragrunt?

Thanks

This looks about right. Unfortunately, I don't think there is any other way to do this, as most other organizations will introduce cycles across the dependencies.

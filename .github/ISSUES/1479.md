# Question: implicitly loading a dependency output in the inputs

**ghost** commented *Jan 5, 2021*

So I have a set of modules that depends on module A.

For these modules they usually need the same outputs from dependency A. The little issue is it's 15 outputs that need to be passed to the input.

What I was thinking of getting is to use the dependency output as part of the default input (like seen on https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example/blob/master/terragrunt.hcl#L62 ):

```
dependency "A" {
  config_path = "${path_relative_to_include()}/../A"
  config_path = "${path_relative_from_include()}/../A"
  config_path = "./A"

  mock_outputs = {
  }
}

inputs = merge(
  local.project_vars.locals,
  local.region_vars.locals,
  local.environment_vars.locals,
  dependency.A.outputs,
)
```

So I tried to add the dependancy as part of the parent include but that didn't work. I'm under the impression that it shouldn't work but not sure why. It breaking on some path not found whatever the config_path is.

The workaround I found is from: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/940#issuecomment-610108712:
I created a:
`A.hcl`
```
dependency "A" {
  config_path = "./A"
}

inputs = {
  final_out = dependency.A.outputs
}
```

 Then in my module needing the dependancy:
```
locals{
  A     = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("A.hcl"))
}

inputs = merge(local.A.inputs.final_out,{
REST_OF_INPUTS})
```

Is that the cleanest way of achieving that?

I feel like I overcomplicated it a bit and I assume I could have simply used:
```
inputs = merge(dependency.A.output, {
  REST_OF_INPUTS
})
```
This is obviously taking that I'm confident of no name overlap

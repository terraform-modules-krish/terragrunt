# get_parent_terragrunt_dir is broken with multiple include blocks

**dudicoco** commented *Oct 31, 2021*

With the addition of multiple include blocks, the `get_parent_terragrunt_dir` function stops working.

Example `terragrunt.hcl`:
```hcl
terraform {
  source = "git@github.com:xxxxxxxxxx//eks-cluster?ref=eks-cluster_v1.1.15"
}

prevent_destroy = true

dependency "vpc_peering_1" {
  config_path = "${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/account/us-east-1/_global/devops/vpc-peering/my-peering"

  skip_outputs = true
}

include "root" {
  path           = find_in_parent_folders()
  merge_strategy = "deep"
}

include "module" {
  path           = "${dirname(find_in_parent_folders())}/_common/eks-cluster.hcl"
  merge_strategy = "deep"
}
```

Error:
```sh
$ terragrunt plan
ERRO[0000] /account/us-east-1/dev/devops/eks-cluster/main/terragrunt.hcl:8,20-46: Error in function call; Call to function "get_parent_terragrunt_dir" failed: Expected 1 params for function path_relative_from_include, but got 0., and 1 other diagnostic(s)
ERRO[0000] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1
```

Ah this is because when using multiple include blocks, which parent dir you are referring to is ambiguous. You need to pass in the `include` block name you want the parent dir of, either `root` or `module` in your example. E.g., `get_parent_terragrunt_dir("root")`.

Side note: I thought this was mentioned in the docs, but I just checked and noticed it is missing... Will be opening a PR to address that.

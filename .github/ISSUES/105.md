# AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE environment variable not respected

**gbonk** commented *Jan 24, 2017*

I have set the AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE but it's not being honored by terragrunt.

Terraform operates fine.

If I set AWS_PROFILE to the correct profile then terragrunt works fine
We are using the following versions of 

Terraform v0.8.4
terragrunt version v0.9.3
aws-cli/1.11.36 Python/2.7.9 Windows/7 botocore/1.4.93

Here's the error I get, noting that I'm certain of having the S3 bucket available and accessable

```
$ terragrunt apply

@gbonk I think what's going on here is that the awscli uses the `AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE` env var, but the AWS SDK for Go does not. If you check out the [AWS SDK for Go docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/configuring-sdk.html
), it appears that only the `AWS_PROFILE` env var is used by the AWS SDK for Go. To use a default profile, you actually have to name that profile `[default]`.

Does switching to `AWS_PROFILE` solve the problem?

@josh-padnick I'm a coworker of @gbonk. The issue is that we have set the following in our `provider-aws.tf`:
```
provider "aws" {
  region = "${var.aws-region}"
  profile = "saml"
}
```

Doing a `terraform plan` works as expected, using the 'saml' AWS profile. It's only when we go to `terragrunt plan` that things don't work anymore. So, terragrunt isn't acting as a completely transparent wrapper.

The issue is actually that Terragrunt has its own AWS API calls separate from Terraform and that *those* calls use the [default credential provider](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/aws_helper/config.go) of the AWS Go SDK, which, per my previous comment doesn't support the `AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE` value. It looks like [even Terraform doesn't support AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/10039).

Could you try just setting the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable? It looks like that solutions worked on #21. 

Adding explicit support for AWS profiles would be nice and is not something Terragrunt supports yet. You can track the progress at https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/48.

Since #108 has been released and I believe I've addressed your issue, I'm going to close this issue. Feel free to comment if additional input is needed!

That's fine for now.  If we set both Variables, AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE and AWS_PROFILE then everything works fine.  Not elegant but it's a sufficient work around

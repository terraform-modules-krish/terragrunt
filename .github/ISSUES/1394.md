# Can destroy-all ignore undeployed-stack related dependency errors while still erroring in other situations? (eg a child stack failed to destroy)

**Makeshift** commented *Oct 19, 2020*

When running destroy-all today, I accidentally left some logfiles in an S3 bucket, meaning that the destruction of that stack failed.

I didn't see this error until the end of the run, by which time the stack containing the VPC that the failed stack depended on had been destroyed. 

After emptying the bucket, I then wasn't able to destroy that stack due to dependent stack not being deployed. I had to redeploy my VPC stack in order to delete the failed stack.

I'm aware that `mock_outputs` are a thing (#1385) that I'm now slowly applying to my codebase, but it would be preferable to be able to avoid this situation entirely.

I'm not sure I follow entirely. Could you explain your dependency graph a bit more? What modules depend on what, and through what mechanisms (e.g., are you using `dependency { ... }` blocks)?

I put together an [example repo](https://github.com/Makeshift/terragrunt-1394-complete-example) to try and replicate, and then realised what I did - I used the `--terragrunt-ignore-dependency-errors` flag in order to avoid errors for modules that hadn't been deployed, but obviously that also means that errors like this are also ignored:

```
Cannot process module Module /home/connor/WebstormProjects/wsl/terragrunt-1394-complete-example/terragrunt/make-vpc (excluded: false, dependencies: []) because one of its dependencies, Module /home/connor/WebstormProjects/wsl/terragrunt-1394-complete-example/terragrunt/make-bucket (excluded: false, dependencies: [/home/connor/WebstormProjects/wsl/terragrunt-1394-complete-example/terragrunt/make-vpc]), finished with an error: Hit multiple errors:
```

So I suppose I should probably revise my question - Is it possible to do `destroy-all` commands, telling it to ignore issues where dependencies don't exist (due to not being deployed), but still exiting in situations where a dependent failed to destroy?

Here's how to replicate the situation in the issue description, given my [example repo](https://github.com/Makeshift/terragrunt-1394-complete-example):

* deploy `make-bucket` and `make-vpc`, leaving `dont-deploy-this-stack` and `dont-deploy-this-stack-either` undeployed
    * This replicates a common situation I'm in, where I have a mixture of deployed and undeployed stacks in the same folder, due to errors or other means.
* run `terragrunt destroy-all`
   * At this point, destruction will fail early due to one of the `dont-deploy` stacks depending on the other, even though neither are deployed
* run `terragrunt destroy-all --terragrunt-ignore-dependency-errors` (to ignore the dependency error the two `dont-deploy` stacks create)
   * Here, you end up in the horrific place I put myself in, as `make-vpc` gets destroyed, but `make-bucket` does not, and now `make-bucket` can't be destroyed OR deployed without first re-deploying `make-vpc`


Am I over-complicating this? Can this be easily solved with `skip_outputs` or something?

Oh, I gotcha. I'm of two minds on this. On the one hand, it's not an unreasonable request... But on the other, it's yet another CLI flag, another behavior to document/understand/maintain, etc... Perhaps the better workaround here is if you have modules with known errors, you exclude them? See https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli-options/#terragrunt-exclude-dir.

That's fair - I can totally understand not wanting to clutter everything up with more flags. The only real effect now that I understand what I was doing wrong is that I need to pay more attention to which stacks I haven't deployed.

Thanks for your help. I'll rename the issue to better track the actual request, but feel free to close it if you don't think it needs to be implemented.

Thanks for understanding! I think for now, to avoid too many flags, I'll  close this.

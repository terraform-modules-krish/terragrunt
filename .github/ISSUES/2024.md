# optional_var_files resulting in "Failed to read variables file" error for missing file

**glenthomas** commented *Feb 23, 2022*

The documentation says

> optional_var_files (optional): A list of file paths to terraform vars files (.tfvars) that will be passed in to terraform like required_var_files, only any files that do not exist are ignored.

I have this terragrunt.hcl:

```hcl
terraform {
  extra_arguments "inputs" {
    commands = get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars()
    optional_var_files = [
      "inputs.${get_env("CI_ENVIRONMENT_NAME", "dev")}.tfvars"
    ]
  }
}
```


The file does not exist and a `terraform plan` command results in this error

```
╷
│ Error: Failed to read variables file
│ 
│ Given variables file inputs.dev.tfvars does not exist.
╵
ERRO[0001] 1 error occurred:
        * exit status 1
```

When I remove the optional_var_files configuration the error goes away.

My expectation is that the missing file is ignored because it is optional rather than required.

I have discovered the reason for this behaviour...

A file with that name does exist in the directory that I am running the terragrunt command in, BUT I have set TERRAGRUNT_WORKING_DIR to a different directory.

It appears that terragrunt is checking for the existence of the file in the wrong directory before choosing whether to add the terraform var-file argument. The file existence check should take the TERRAGRUNT_WORKING_DIR into account.

# Defining user data in auto scaling group?

**alexs77** commented *Mar 15, 2019*

When manually creating an auto scaling group, in step 3, it's possible to define "user data", which will be run during boot on Linux, eg. like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/781361/54433546-6af3b380-472c-11e9-9f47-64ae5dfc5a16.png)

How do I define this in terragrunt/terraform?

I know that I can set `user_data` in `autoscaling/terraform.tfvars`, like so:

    user_data = "#!/bin/bash"

But how can I define a multi line value there?

@alexs77 first of all you are asking about terraform HCL basics

The answer for your question is HEREDOC syntax, here is example of using heredoc:
https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/f799a133e3c1a8c9756c37287bc646a545edfe89/config/test-fixtures/heredoc.tf#L44

@tomaszkrzyzanowski thanks for the link. Works fine.

Sorry for bringing this issue again

I would like to define the user-data script in a separate `.tpl` file.
I could do that in my TF module without any issue using `file()` command, and having my file inside the module.

With terragrunt, it fails to call the file and i don't find a way to find the file when my module is in a remote repository:

```
data "template_file" "user_data" {
  template = file(
    "../modules/timescaledb/script-template/configure_tsdb.tpl",
  )

  vars = {
    secret_id = aws_secretsmanager_secret.tsdb_credentials.name
    region = var.aws_region
    dbname = var.timescaledb_dbname
  }
}
```

The `configure_tsdb.tpl` exists but i get a:

```
Call to function "file" failed: no file exists at
../modules/timescaledb/script-template/configure_tsdb.tpl.
```

In order for relative paths to work, you need to use a double slash in your `source` URLs. Search for "double slash" in the docs: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt#remote-terraform-configurations

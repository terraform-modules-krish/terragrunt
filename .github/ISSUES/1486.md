# Error on sops_decrypt_file() function : failed: Error getting data key

**ashokpokharel977** commented *Jan 12, 2021*

**Context**
Versions:
`terraform: v0.14.4`
`terragrunt: v0.27.0`
`sops: 3.6.1 (latest)`

**Steps:**
I have configured SOPS with generator:
` .sops.yaml `
```
creation_rules:
  - path_regex: \.dev\.yaml$
    kms: *kms_arn*
    aws_profile: dev
```
To generate a file 

`sops secrets.dev.yaml`

It generates file with encryption as:

```
hello: ENC[AES256_GCM,data:8gtnzBNu2AG9l2zHFy3ovCS0gWFj3bdjgb3B/X8CUkvgox8GcxLQv/99aMUndQ==,iv:lw8VYzpWQUrm6bWQgJ6/KEYizhe8VxJAmdysF+Q6zTM=,tag:vRrdCo/iH4ec4dPzI7DB5Q==,type:str]
sops:
    kms:
    -   arn: *kms_arn*
        created_at: '2021-01-12T05:24:17Z'
        enc: *enc_key*
        aws_profile: dev
    gcp_kms: []
    azure_kv: []
    hc_vault: []
    lastmodified: "2021-01-12T05:24:43Z"
    mac: *mac_key*
    pgp: []
    unencrypted_suffix: _unencrypted
    version: 3.6.1
```
**SOPS usage**

- Encryption: `sops secrets.dev.yaml`
- Decryption: `sops -d secrets.dev.yaml`

Both Encryption and Decryption are working as expected.  

**Using in terragrunt:**

`terragrunt.hcl`

```
locals {
  secret_vars = yamldecode(sops_decrypt_file(find_in_parent_folders("secrets.dev.yaml")))
}
```

**Error:**
```
Error: Error in the function call:

Call to function "sops_decrypt_file" failed: Error getting data key: 0 successful groups required, got 0.

```
**Expected Behaviour**
Able to decrypt and use it in locals in terragrunt

Thanks for the bug report. Are you using AWS KMS to encrypt secrets with kops? And if so, how are you authenticating to AWS?
***

**ashokpokharel977** commented *Jan 19, 2021*

@brikis98  Yes I am using AWS KMS for both encryption and decryption. For auth, I am using named profiles  with the  variable  `export AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG=1`
Is there an option to configure named profile in terragrunt for SOPS
***

**brikis98** commented *Jan 19, 2021*

Hm, it's possible that the current `sops` implementation isn't properly respecting named profiles... If someone has some time to dig in and figure that out, a PR is very welcome.

you need to set your AWS_PROFILE env to dev it looks like, `export AWS_PROFILE=dev` then run tg.

Agree that it seems like terragrunts sops implementation is not respecting profiles correctly.

I get this error when the sops file has `aws_profile` on the keys set to something other than the `AWS_PROFILE` env var. This issue does not happen when using the actual `sops` program itself, but it does happen when using terragrunts `sops_decrypt_file`. Using terragrunt v0.28.7.

This is a legitimate use case, where I am executing all terraform/terragrunt code via an IAM user in a management account and AssumeRole, and my sops files are encrypted using keys that are specific to each concrete account. Then my `AWS_PROFILE` env var is set to the management account, but the sops files `aws_profile` points to the concrete accounts.

However, I have worked around this by having the sops files also set the `aws_profile` to the management account, and set the `role` field so it also does AssumeRole, just like the terraform/terragrunt code. And this is probably actually a better solution anyway. But still, this issue should be fixed nonetheless.

Using `export AWS_PROFILE=dev` is not an option for me as I am using generate `provider.tf`
```
account_vars = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("account.hcl"))
generate "provider" {
  path      = "provider.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  contents  = <<EOF
provider "aws" {
  region = "${local.aws_region}"
  shared_credentials_file = "~/.aws/credentials"
  profile                 = "${local.account_name}"
}
EOF
}
```
I ended up with a workaround setting roles directly inside key groups
```
creation_rules:
  - path_regex: \.dev\.yaml$
    key_groups:
      - kms:
          - arn: <<kms_arn>>
            role: <<role_arn>>
```

Hi @ashokpokharel977,

Are you using AWS Single Sign-On and your profile is on `~/.aws/config` ?
If that's the case then it will be fixed once this is done https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1629.

If not, and your are using `~/.aws/credentials` then it should be working already. 
It has been working with that for quite a while for me.
My code is almost the same as yours...

Updating to terragrunt 0.28.22 fixed this issue for me.

**madsonic** commented *May 31, 2021*

for what it's worth, the config spec is [here](https://github.com/mozilla/sops/blob/66043e71a81787d6513bc2e5505a29aac67dc6f1/config/config.go)

i haven't seen any examples/docs/tests with the `role` spec so it might be a little elusive.

Hi,
the issue should be fixed after upgrading to Terragrunt v0.36.8

https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.36.8

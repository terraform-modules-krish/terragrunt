# sops_decrypt_file string as input instead of filepath

**Zyntogz** commented *Jan 22, 2021*

Hey guys,

i really appreciate terragrunt and I am already in love with it. Thank you for all your efforts!

I recently had the use case of storing sensitive information used by terragrunt in Version Control. I was glad that terragrunt offers the sops_decrypt_file() method for this and i implemented everything around this. Works like a charm.

However, it may be an improvement if the parameter for this function would be a string instead of a path. SOPS basically encrypts the values, but the used KMS key is still visible. So if I want to hide this information, a quite basic way could be to base64 encode it afterwards and save the file. 

If terragrunt's sops_decrypt_file() would also accept text, something like this should be possible:
```secret = yamldecode(sops_decrypt_file(base64decode(file("${get_terragrunt_dir()}/secret.encrypted.yaml"))))```
This could open even more options for further processing of SOPS files.

I wanted to look into the code to make a proposal or something like that but I didn't get it (maybe i'm not into GO). However, i assume you're using the sops library. However, SOPS CLI decode method is also able to read from stdin if one passes directly the /dev/stdin device as input path. However, if doing so, one has to pass the --input-type and the --output-type values so that everything works.
Example snippet from a bash script: 
```base64 -d $1 | sops --input-type yaml --output-type yaml -d /dev/stdin```

To stay backwards compatible a new function would be needed (for example sops_decrypt_string()) . The cleaner solution would be a restructuring of the function to a new sops_decrypt(<parameter>::string) function that basically could work like this (python version):
```
if parameter.startswith("file://"):
  // use current implementation
else:
  // use new stuff
```

Adding a `sops_decrypt_string` or similar function makes sense to me. Current [sops code is here](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/config/config_helpers.go#L515). PRs welcome!

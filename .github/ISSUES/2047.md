# Commit terraform.lock.hcl into GitHub

**drey0143143** commented *Mar 21, 2022*

Hi guys,
          I want to commit the terraform.lock.hcl file when running GitHub Actions in opeville/opeville-aws-terraform so that the version remain locked but I'm having some issue achieving that. Please any suggestion on how to achieve this when running GitHub Actions.

Hi,
to commit changes can be re-used existing actions like [add-commit](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/add-commit) or explicitly ["git add / commit"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57921401/push-to-origin-from-github-action/58393457#58393457) , however, commiting `terraform.lock.hcl` can lead to issues on execution in [different platforms](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28041)

@denis256 Thanks for your response but having in mind the issues that can arise from committing terraform.lock.hcl,how would i reference that so that github actions can commit that when running?

@denis256 my use case will only apply to a single platform(Ubuntu)

Hi,
a simplified approach will be to remove from `.gitignore` if present `terraform.lock.hcl`, and to have a step to commit file:

```
      - name: Commit lock file
        run: |
          git config --global user.name 'Your Name'
          git config --global user.email 'your-username@users.noreply.github.com'
          git add terraform.lock.hcl
          git commit -m "Persisting lock file"
          git push
```

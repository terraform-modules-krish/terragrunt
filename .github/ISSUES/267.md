# `terragrunt import` does not persist

#Hullo - I've been using TG for a while with older TF versions, and this is my first outing with TG 0.13 and TF 0.10...

All my Terraform `.tf` files live in the `tf` directory, with `environments/dev` underneath that. I am working with a locked-down AWS account where I do not have access to create network resources - I need to import an existing VPC / subnets, etc. to the local state file.

TG setup is like so:

```
[developer@devBox tf]$ more environments/terraform.tfvars 
terragrunt {
  remote_state {
    backend = "s3"
    config {
      bucket     = "terraform-state-${get_aws_account_id()}-${path_relative_to_include()}"
      key        = "terraform.tfstate"
      region     = "eu-west-2"
      encrypt    = true
    }
  }
}

[developer@devBox tf]$ more environments/dev/terraform.tfvars 
terragrunt = {
  terraform = {
    source = "${path_relative_from_include()}/../../"
  }

  include {
    path = "${find_in_parent_folders()}"
  }
}
```

I define the VPC simply in `aws.tf`:

```
provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-2"
}

resource "aws_vpc" "main_vpc" {  
    cidr_block = "10.179.48.0/20"

    tags {
        Name = "n076datvpc001"
    }
}
``` 

and then `terragrunt plan`, then very sensibly Terraform wants to create the VPC.

Now I try to import the existing VPC:

```
[developer@devBox dev]$ terragrunt import aws_vpc.main_vpc vpc-a34afbca

the resource configurations match the current (or desired) state of the                                                                                                                                        
imported resources. You can use the output from "terraform plan" to verify that                                                                                                                                
the configuration is correct and complete.                                                                                                                                                                     

```
I can see the VPC definition in `/tmp/terragrunt/acP5FOqj91Lz08E549B0dEiQ7u8/e_TPzidHXV2ZjUKk0SDVRwpJrm8/terraform.tfstate`

The problem is then if I immediately do another `terragrunt plan` then it gets overwritten with the 'VPC not present' and once again Terraform wants to create a VPC.

What am I doing wrong?

This was a combination of two things:

1) The AWS account I was using was missing S3:ListObjects permissions

2) I was missing the simple `terraform { backend "s3" {} }` block from my `aws.tf`

This was really helpful and helped me figure things out, thank you for sharing!

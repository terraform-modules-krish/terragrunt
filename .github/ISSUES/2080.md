# Consider adding the ability to automatically import from and export to Terraform workspaces

**brikis98** commented *Apr 22, 2022*

If you originally set up a project using Terraform workspaces, switching to Terragrunt is a lot of work, in terms of having to create lots of new folders and `terragrunt.hcl` files, plus a bunch of state surgery using `terraform state` commands. Similarly, if you originally set up a project using Terragrunt, switching to workspaces is a lot of work. I wonder if it would be possible to add commands that automagically do most of this work for you? Something like:

- `terragrunt convert from-workspaces` automatically reads your TF code and state files, generates `terragrunt.hcl` files for you, and runs a bunch of `terraform state` commands to shuffle the state around accordingly.
- `terragrunt convert to-workspaces` automatically reads your TG code and state files, generates `.tf` files for you, and runs a bunch of `terraform state` and `terraform workspace` commands to shuffle the state around accordingly.

I'm not sure if/when we'd be able to take this on, but ideas, suggestions, and contributions are very welcome here.

# `--terragrunt-include-dir` includes only one level of dependencies

**geekofalltrades** commented *Mar 17, 2022*

On Terragrunt v0.36.0.

A command like `tg run-all apply --terragrunt-include-dir A` will include the direct dependencies of `A`, but it does not reliably include the dependencies of those dependencies.

I think part of the problem might be here: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/v0.36.0/configstack/module.go#L203

This code includes the dependencies of directories that match `--terragrunt-include-dir` globs, but does not then recurse into those dependencies to include _their_ dependencies.

I say it doesn't "reliably" include them because, in my stack, I have one dependency being included that isn't a direct dependency of the `--terragrunt-include-dir` module, and I can't figure out why. (Possibly related to something like #808, although I tried renaming folders to change their alphabetical ordering, and couldn't get the behavior to change.)

An anonymized version of my directory layout and dependency graph (which might not be very helpful):

```
A/
    1/
    2/
    3/
    4/
    5/
B/
    1/
    2/
    3/
C/
    1/
```

```
digraph {
        "A/1" ;
        "A/2" ;
        "A/2" -> "A/1";
        "A/2" -> "A/3";
        "A/2" -> "A/5";
        "A/3" ;
        "A/3" -> "A/5";
        "A/4" ;
        "A/4" -> "B/1";
        "A/4" -> "A/2";
        "A/5" ;
        "B/1" ;
        "B/1" -> "A/2";
        "B/2" ;
        "B/2" -> "A/2";
        "B/3" ;
        "B/3" -> "A/2";
        "B/3" -> "A/4";
        "C/1" ;
        "C/1" -> "B/2";
        "C/1" -> "B/3";
        "C/1" -> "A/2";
}
```

The command I'm running, from the root (where `A`, `B`, and `C` are), is:

```
terragrunt run-all apply --terragrunt-ignore-external-dependencies --terragrunt-include-dir C/1
```

I expect this command to include *everything* in this graph, since they're all dependencies, but instead, I only get:

```
Group 1
- Module A/2

Group 2
- Module A/4
- Module B/2

Group 3
- Module B/3

Group 4
- Module C/1
```

Notice that all direct dependencies of `C/1` are included. But so is `A/4`, for some reason. Everything else is for some reason excluded.

We're also experiencing this (version 0.36.2), tested with the following structure:
```
/foo
  /main.tf
  /terragrunt.hcl
/bar
  /main.tf
  /terragrunt.hcl
    dependency "foo" {
      config_path = "../foo"
    }
/baz/a
  /main.tf
  /terragrunt.hcl
    dependency "bar" {
      config_path = "../../bar"
    }
```
Running `terragrunt run-all apply --terragrunt-include-dir 'baz/*'`
```
Group 1
- Module /home/ondrej/www/yr/playground/terragrunt/bar

Group 2
- Module /home/ondrej/www/yr/playground/terragrunt/baz/a
```

only projects to apply modules `bar` and `baz/a`, when all 3 should be. The problem persists even when the targeted module is not nested.

One possible workaround for the nested case might be running `terragrunt run-all --terragrunt-include-external-dependencies apply` inside the `/3/a` subdirectory. This does correctly project to apply all 3 modules.

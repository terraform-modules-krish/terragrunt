# Log which AWS call fails during bucket creation

**cah-andrew-fitzgerald** commented *Aug 24, 2020*

I missed the docs on terragrunt and AWS permissions ([link](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/aws-auth/#aws-credentials)) and was working off the terraform docs instead ([link](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/s3.html)) which have a reduced set of permissions.


While trying to execute `terragrunt init`, I received this error:
```
[terragrunt] [<build-dir>] 2020/08/24 05:12:20 Initializing remote state for the s3 backend
[terragrunt] 2020/08/24 05:12:20 AccessDenied: Access Denied
	status code: 403, request id: <request-id>, host id: <host-id>
```
It took me quite a while to figure out that the issue was missing `s3:GetBucketVersioning`.

It would be nice if the error message explicitly mentioned the request that failed or gave some other hint.

Ah, yea, AWS error messages leave much to be desired. We'll need to add some extra decoration when we catch those errors to make it clearer what was happening. A PR to improve this is very welcome!

Is there anywhere in the docs with a list of required IAM permissions?

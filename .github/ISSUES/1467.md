# Unable to download module from private github repo - weird parse error

**theothermike** commented *Dec 16, 2020*

Trying to use the guide to download a module I've created to test adopting Terragrunt with.

here is the terragrunt.hcl (redacted my actual info, but this string results in same error)
```
terraform {
  source = "git::ssh://org-123@github.com:org/terraform-model-aws.git"
}
```
which produces this error
```

It looks like its having problems properly parsing the source url - given its trying to do a git clone with the File:/// path.   I did try adding my actual string (and this string) to the mock in config/config_helpers_test.go, but that still passes, so the problem must be elsewhere.

I will try to dig into it tomorrow, but I'm relatively new to go, and this is first I've seen terragrunt source

Ah, I see the issue.   github.com/org instead of github.com:org (which is the url you get when you paste from Clone in github).  closing

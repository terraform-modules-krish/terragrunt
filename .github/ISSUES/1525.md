# `terragrunt run-all show` parse by directories in stack

**marshall7m** commented *Feb 3, 2021*

### Versions:
`terragrunt==0.28.1`
`terraform==0.14.4`

### Background:

I have a `plan.json` file within each child terragrunt directory `.terragrunt-cache/.../.terraform/ ` that was created by `terragrunt run-all plan -out plan.json`

### Problem:
Running `terragrunt run-all show -json plan.json` on the stack outputs the plan for each child terragrunt directory. Currently, the above command concatenates all of the child terragrunt plans into one long string. I want to partition the output of the command by each child directory although within the plan.json that there's no attribute to identify the terragrunt directory.  

### Example scenario:

Run: `terragrunt run-all show -json plan.json`

Current output:
```
{"format_version":"0.1","terraform_version":"0.14.5","variables":{"names":{"value":["bar"]}}, ......}
{"format_version":"0.1","terraform_version":"0.14.5","variables":{"names":{"value":["bar"]}}, ......}
```

Proposed new output (or something along the lines of):
```
terragrunt-dir='foo/'
{"format_version":"0.1","terraform_version":"0.14.5","variables":{"names":{"value":["bar"]}}, ......}

terragrunt-dir='foo/bar'
{"format_version":"0.1","terraform_version":"0.14.5","variables":{"names":{"value":["bar"]}}, ......}
```

I think I opened an issue earlier for a feature that might also address this issue... https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1194

+1 would love an option like requested in #1194 which would show which folder the stdout is for.

The variables from terragrunt inputs are set as environment variables (`TF_VAR_variable_name`), so they are the lowest precedence as mentioned in [the official tf docs](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html#variable-definition-precedence).

But that is a good point that this isn't documented!

I updated the issue to reflect the lack of documentation and will keep this open until we resolve the missing docs.

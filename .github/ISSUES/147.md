# Fold "extra_arguments" into terragrunt when using "include" to retrieve remote TF configurations

**rkr-kununu** commented *Feb 24, 2017*

So, I've got the following setup:
* /terraform.tfvars
  * /preview/terraform.tfvars

The contents of `/terraform.tfvars` is:
```
terragrunt = {
  lock { ... }
  remote_state { ... }
  terraform {
    extra_arguments "global" {
      arguments = [ "-var", "account_id=12345" ]
    }
  }
}
```

The contents of `/preview/terraform.tfvars` is:
```
terragrunt = {
  include {
    path = "${find_in_parent_folders()}"
  }
  terraform {
    source = "git::git@github.com:foo/bar.git//app?ref=v0.0.1"
  }
}
```

The idea being that in app I would have access to `var.account_id`.  This is of course not possible (currently) because the terraform source-block will override the terraform extra_arguments-block.

The solution described in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/143 could be applied (put my configuration into a separate tfvars), but it would mean I'd need to cut-and-paste the extra_arguments blocks into /preview/terraform.tfvars (and future staging environments).

Ah, yea, that's not ideal. 

I think the way we are merging keys from `include` is fairly coarse grained, where we simply override top-level keys: `lock`, `remote_state`, `terraform`. We could merge the values together, but that will leave other holes, as then there would be no way to unset a value...

I'm open to ideas here.

One thing I've been considering is a new interpolation function: 

```
read_var_from_file(VAR, FILE)
```

The idea is that it returns the value of a variable `VAR`  read from `.tfvars` file `FILE`. It could replace most use cases for `include`, as you could just explicitly pull in the values you want, but also allow much finer grained control:

```hcl
terragrunt = {
  lock = "${read_var_from_file("terragrunt.lock", find_in_parent_folders())}"
  remote_state = "${read_var_from_file("terragrunt.remote_state", find_in_parent_folders())}"
  terraform {
    source = "git::git@github.com:foo/bar.git//app?ref=v0.0.1"
    extra_arguments {
      global = "${read_var_from_file("terragrunt.terraform.extra_arguments", find_in_parent_folders())}"
    }
  }
}
```

This may also solve #132, as it will allow you to reuse values of arbitrary variables (not just Terragrunt ones) from your `.tfvars` files:

```
aws_region = "us-east-1"

terragrunt = {
  remote_state {
    backend = "s3"
    config {
      encrypt = "true"
      bucket = "my-bucket"
      key = "terraform.tfstate"
      region = "${read_var_from_file("aws_region", self())}"
    }    
  }
}
```

This is something I would like to see as well. If we could come to an agreement on a solution, I could put some work into making a PR.
***

**brikis98** commented *Mar 12, 2017*

@andrewrynhard My best guess for a solution is the one in the comment above yours: a `read_var_from_file` helper. On a related note, in order for path lookups to work well, we should also add support for a `path.module` style helper as [described here](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/143#issuecomment-281660992).

I want to work on both of these, but have been utterly buried recently, and just haven't been able to find the time, so I'd be grateful for PRs!

**andrewrynhard** commented *Mar 12, 2017*

Great, I will take a look and see what I can get done this week.
***

**shaharmor** commented *May 11, 2017*

This sounds like a very needed feature for reducing duplication. Any update on this?
***

**brikis98** commented *May 11, 2017*

Nothing on my end. I submitted a flurry of PRs recently to update Terragrunt to support Terraform 0.9 and add a few other critical features, but have not had time for this one. @andrewrynhard, have you had a chance to take a look? 
***

**andrewrynhard** commented *May 11, 2017*

I have not had a chance yet. Hopefully soon.

**askainet** commented *May 12, 2017*

A deep merge of the terraform key would be really nice to solve this!
***

**jocgir** commented *May 25, 2017*

On our [fork](https://github.com/coveo/terragrunt), we made a lot of enhancements including:

- Support of ${var.varname}
- Deep merge of terragrunt/terraform config
- Support for nested configurations (more than one level of include)
- Add a criteria to determine uniqueness of a configuration by using separate temporary folder for each configuration (in our case, it is based on region/env)
- Include of remote configuration to easy share our configuration between our multiple teams
- Importing files from external source in the current temporary folder
- Pre and Post hooks that are executed during the terragrunt process
- Auto-discovery of configuration through some magic with tags and security groups
- More flexible logging (using [go-logging](github.com/op/go-logging))
- Possibility to ignore some folder in -all operations
- Clean output on -all operations

Ultimately, our team only have to include that config file in their `terraform` folder and the rest (discovery of environment, region, providers, S3 backend, keys, extra_args for variables, locking, etc.) is magic:
```hcl
project = "projectname"

terragrunt = {
    include {
        source = "${discover("bootstrap", var.env, "default")}"
    }
}
```

But having a new feature is one thing. Make a good PR from it with complete documentation and tests is another thing. We are trying to find time to package our changes in complete PRs to make them available to the root project.

**brikis98** commented *May 25, 2017*

@jocgir Wow, that's fantastic üëç 

We'd love to hear more about each of these and get many of them into terragrunt itself. Please let me know if there's anything we can do to make that easier! Of course, we should discuss each item to make sure it's a good fit for the general Terragrunt community before you do the work to submit a PR, but I suspect a lot of these will be useful for a lot of people!

I like the `read_var_from_file` interpolation function as a solution for the problem originally posted by @rkr-kununu 

I would use it in the parent tfvars file's `terragrunt.terraform.source` to look up a `source` variable from the child tfvars file.  This would allow me to put everything in the parent tfvars file.

I also see lots of other use cases for a `read_var_from_file` interpolation function.
Any chance this will be implemented soon?

I also like the ideas done/proposed by @jocgir , but I would hate to hold up implementation of a simple function while waiting on that much larger work.
***

**philsttr** commented *Jun 16, 2017*

After investigating adding the `read_var_from_file` option, I found that it was going to be pretty complex since the interpolation syntax and associated regexes were going to need modifying to support functions within functions (in order to support things like `${read_var_from_file("terragrunt.lock", find_in_parent_folders())}`).

I then looked at @jocgir's deep merging approach for `extra_arguments`, and found it to be quite simple and elegant.  (Nice work @jocgir!)  So I have created PR #235 by isolating that change, and providing documentation and unit tests.

BTW, you can "unset" an `extra_arguments` block by creating an empty `extra_arguments` block in the child with the same name as a parent.  Fairly intuitive, I think.
***

**philsttr** commented *Jun 19, 2017*

I believe PR #235 fixes @rkr-kununu's original request.  So this can probably be closed.

Separate individual issues could be opened for the items implemented by @jocgir
***

**brikis98** commented *Jun 19, 2017*

@philsttr Good point. New issues for the other items discussed in this thread are more than welcome.
***

**geekifier** commented *Apr 4, 2018*

@jocgir are there any plans to work towards some PRs from your fork?

I found that your logging system is a major improvement, however, diff-ing your codebase against the current master produces an overwhelming set of changes.

Are there pieces that could be incorporated with relative ease given some community involvement?

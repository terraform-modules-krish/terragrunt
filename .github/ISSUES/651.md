# Question: how to add resources in specific environments

**arthurk** commented *Feb 12, 2019*

I have a question regarding the best-practice when separating resources in environments.

Using the example code in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-modules-example and https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example.

Example: I would like to add an IAM role to the `stage` environment but not in `production`, how would I handle this?

Thank you!

So based on [how-is-the-code-in-this-repo-organized](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example#how-is-the-code-in-this-repo-organized)

How I do it is:
1. Create a generic module for IAM Role on the modules repo.
2. Add the resource in the corresponding path I want to use it:
```
account
 └ _global
 └ region
    └ _global
    └ stage
       └ resource -> IAM Role
    └ production
       └ resource
```
Make sure the IAM role have access to only other staging resources based on the policy you will create.

I hope that makes sense arthurk.

If stage and production should have different IAM Roles, I cannot include the same module. Should I write two modules (iam-staging, iam-prod)?

I think that's the easiest way to go initially yes.

Another way is with an if statement if you have all roles in a single module: 

```
# Stage role
resource "aws_iam_role" "stage" {
  count = "${var.create_stage_role ? 1 : 0}"
.
.
.
}
```

Investigate this [here](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-iam/tree/master/modules/iam-assumable-roles)

Regarding best practice I am not sure, someone else might be able to give advise. I would love to hear @brikis98 suggestion.

Please read https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt#keep-your-terraform-code-dry. 

> The idea is that you define the Terraform code for your infrastructure just once, in a single repo, called, for example, modules [...]

So create your IAM role module and anything in that module that should behave differently in different environments should be exposed as an input variable. You can then have a `stage/iam-roles/terraform.tfvars` that sets the appropriate values for stage and a `prod/iam-roles/terraform.tfvars` that sets the appropriate values for prod.

I think I explained a little unclear. My problem is this: I make a generic IAM module that has the following code in it:

```
resource "google_project_iam_member" "project" {
  project = "${var.projectid}"
  role    = "${var.role}"
  member  = "user:${var.email}"
}
```

but now in stage environment i would like 3 `google_project_iam_member` resources but in production environment I want only 1 `google_project_iam_member` resource. My question is how I can create a module that makes either 1 or 3 resources depending on the environment. I guess I'd have to make changes in the -live repo, but I'm not sure what to change.

Take in the list of member names as an input variable and use `count` to loop over each name and create multiple `google_project_iam_member` resources. https://blog.gruntwork.io/terraform-tips-tricks-loops-if-statements-and-gotchas-f739bbae55f9

@brikis98 thank you very much for the answer. I really appreciate you answering questions in github issues, not everyone does that.

# Terragrunt in GovCloud associates "bad" KMS Key ARN when creating bucket and encryption is enabled

**lorengordon** commented *Aug 25, 2022*

The KMS Key ARN that terragrunt associates to the bucket appears hard-coded to use the `aws` partition. However, in GovCloud, the partition is `aws-us-gov`. To reproduce, take a simple terragrunt config:

```
remote_state {
  backend = "s3"

  config = {
    bucket         = "test-terragrunt-govcloud-tfstate"
    dynamodb_table = "test-terragrunt-govcloud-tfstate-lock"
    encrypt        = true
    key            = "tfstate/${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-gov-west-1"
  }

  generate = {
    path      = "backend.tf"
    if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  }
}
```

Set an env credential for govcloud, and run `terragrunt init`:

```
❯ terragrunt init
Remote state S3 bucket test-terragrunt-govcloud-tfstate does not exist or you don't have permissions to access it. Would you like Terragrunt to create it? (y/n) y

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```

Check the bucket encryption config with aws-cli:

```
❯ aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket test-terragrunt-govcloud-tfstate
{
    "ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration": {
        "Rules": [
            {
                "ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault": {
                    "SSEAlgorithm": "aws:kms",
                    "KMSMasterKeyID": "arn:aws:kms:us-gov-west-1:REDACTED:alias/aws/s3"
                },
                "BucketKeyEnabled": false
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Note the partition in the `KMSMasterKeyID`. It should be `aws-us-gov` instead of `aws`. Here it is again after I fix it:

```
❯ aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket test-terragrunt-govcloud-tfstate
{
    "ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration": {
        "Rules": [
            {
                "ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault": {
                    "SSEAlgorithm": "aws:kms",
                    "KMSMasterKeyID": "arn:aws-us-gov:kms:us-gov-west-1:REDACTED:alias/aws/s3"
                },
                "BucketKeyEnabled": false
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Oh, and doublechecked this is occurring on the latest version of terragrunt...

```
❯ terragrunt -version
terragrunt version v0.38.7
```

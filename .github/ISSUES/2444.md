# Terragrunt run-all destroy makes it hard to destroy one module and things that depend on it

**Zyntogz** commented *Feb 10, 2023*

Hey :)

I wondered if i am misunderstanding something or if the problem is sitting in front of the computer: I have a terragrunt setup with quite some modules that have different dependencies. One simplified example could be

Batch depends on SSM
SSM depends on RDS 
RDS depends on VPC

I have the following challenge: We want to destroy the RDS module. Naively thinking, i tried to make a terragrunt run-all destroy on the RDS module and was expecting (like it would during a run-all apply) to find all modules that depend on it and destroy them too (in the example mentioned above SSM and Batch). However, it wanted to destroy only the RDS module. Using the flag --terragrunt-ignore-dependency-errors didn't solve it either. Instead of doing what i expected it "simply" collected all modules that the rds module had a dependency on (hence VPC) and wanted to destroy it (which is definitely not wanted).

Do i understand something wrong here? 

Thank you :)

Hello,
detection of dependent modules depends on how modules and repository are organized: in the current implementation lookup of dependent modules is done from the repository root, if modules aren't on git or in the repo exists broken HCL files detection may not work.

To be on the same page, I prepared a small example:
https://github.com/denis256/issue-2444

In which attempt to remove `rds` hows dependent module:
```
$ cd rds
$ terragrunt destroy
Detected dependent modules:
/projects/tmp/issue-2444/ssm
WARNING: Are you sure you want to continue? (y/n) 
```

Hey, thank you for your response. So it normally works, ok. But how do you Differentiate different deployment configs using your repo structure?

Our repository is basically organized using an Environment/Stage folder structure. In the stage folder is the parent terragrunt HCL file and the respective modules like RDS or ssm. Environment depends on the aws Account to be used (private development account or productive operations account) and stage can be dev/prod/... Using this we can ensure to have one repository that reflects our infrastructure configuration. 

An example would be 

- repo-root
  - deploy-account
    - dev
      - terragrunt.hcl
      - rds
        - terragrunt.hcl
      - ssm
        - terragrunt.hcl
  - personal-dev-acc
    - ...

Is there a way we could still destroy the "right way"? Or does the repository need a restructuring?

It is not clear where dependent modules identification fails, I would try to run with `--terragrunt-log-level debug` to see where it is failing

In the log output is basically no "fail" or "error" section, only debug messages. It seemingly simply does not find dependent modules.

WARNING: Are you sure you want to run `terragrunt destroy` in each folder of the stack described above? There is no undo! (y/n)
```

my terragrunt version is 0.43.2 and i am running it via

```
cd db/test/rds 
terragrunt run-all destroy --terragrunt-log-level debug
```

which should be fine.

Do you have any ideas how i could further debug this? I see no section where it tries to identify dependent modules except the ones listed above where the rds module itself has a dependency on. Normally, as described, it should at least point out a SSM module that has a dependency on the rds module

# undeclared resource error using a dependency

**dratspiker** commented *Jun 22, 2021*

When running `terragrunt plan` in /spoke07/subnet/, I get the following undeclared resource error after following [these](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#dependency) instructions for setting up a dependency. I believe it is because I do not have the variable from the subnet.tf file mapped back to the corresponding terragrunt.hcl correctly but I have not been able to figure out the fix. I have confirmed that `terragrunt output` at /spoke07/vpc/ outputs the vpc-id.

```

  environment_vars = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("env.hcl"))
  region_vars      = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("region.hcl"))

  env    = local.environment_vars.locals.environment
  region = local.region_vars.locals.aws_region
}

terraform {
  source = "${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/tf-spoke/subnet/"
}

dependency "vpc" {
  config_path = "../vpc"
}

include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

inputs = {

}
```

It looks like you are referencing the `dependency` resource in terraform. `dependency` is a terragrunt construct and only available in `terragrunt.hcl`. The idea is to feed the dependency to the terraform module using variable inputs. So in this case, you want to replace whereever you were referencing `dependency` in your terraform module with a variable, and have terragrunt set that variable in the `inputs` map in the `terragrunt.hcl`.

Thank you for your help. I guess I need to figure out how to set the variable from the outputs of the vpc module. I am learning terraform and terragrunt at the same time so I sometimes get lost in the interplay between the two.

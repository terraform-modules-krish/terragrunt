# More than one terragrunt repository managing infrastructure in one AWS account?

**pcurry-hbk** commented *Dec 11, 2017*

The problem I'm trying to solve is providing a sandbox environment to developers who are new to terraform and terragrunt, while still managing that sandbox environment through terragrunt.

Currently we have one repository for managing the infrastructure for all of the sandbox accounts. I want to keep that repository unmodified, while giving a 'playground' repository to developers who are learning. That way, if they break something, I can go back in and restore it from my repository.

My question is, will terragrunt's S3 state management of these two repositories collide with each other?

Not sure I understand the question. 

Generally, when using Terragrunt, we recommend having one repo, `infrastructure-modules`, where all the Terraform modules are defined, and a separate repo, `infrastructure-live`, that deploys specific version of the modules in `infrastructure-modules` across your various environments. See the [repos mentioned at the end of the quick start guide](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt#quick-start) for examples.

If you set things up this way, the sandbox environment would just be another set of subfolders in `infrastructure-live`. You could point those at a standalone set of AWS accounts and a totally separate S3 bucket for remote state, so it'll have no effect whatsoever on your environments. Under the hood, developers would be using versioned modules from `infrastructure-modules`, so at any time, you could revert to your "official" code.

Currently we are using your recommended structure. In training new users of Terraform and Terragrunt, I would like to give them a sandbox repository in which to develop their skills at building modules and configuring said modules, without prematurely allowing access to either modules that production environments rely upon, or the configurations for our environments that are stored in our `infrastructure-live` repo. I would prefer that the sudden but inevitable errors require less git surgery to correct. I've done enough of that fixing my own Terraform errors.

That said, after having looked to the terraform.tfvars in each of the environment directories, it looks like the s3 state between environments is isolated by bucket name. If two Terragrunt users are modifying the same AWS account using two different state storage bucket names, then as long as they don't try to manage the same resource in two places, they should operate independently, yes?

Yup!

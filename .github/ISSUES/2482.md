# Erroneous success on (skipped) imports

**ferricoxide** commented *Mar 8, 2023*

A customer asked me to update how they deploy VPCs. However, the updated method I use renders their legacy method incompatible with the new method. As a result, they want my new module to exist parallel to their legacy module, and then furnish them with a script to import the resources created with the legacy module into the state-registry of the new module. For the most part, things seem to work fine. However, when I need to import resources that leverage named indexes, the `terragrunt import` operation seems to ignore my request.

~~~
terragrunt import 'aws_route_table_association.tenant_route_table_assoc["<AWS_AZ>-<SUBNET_CIDR>"]' "<ROUTE_TABLE_ASSOCIATION_ID>"
~~~ 

Runs to completion, and ultimately exits `0`, but doesn't actually import things. I tried to provoke it into erroring with:
~~~
terragrunt import 'aws_route_table_association.tenant_route_table_assoc["<AWS_AZ>-<SUBNET_CIDR>"]' "<ROUTE_TABLE_ID>"
~~~ 
and:
~~~
terragrunt import 'aws_route_table_association.tenant_route_table_assoc["<AWS_AZ>-<SUBNET_CIDR>"]' "<SUBNET_ID>"
~~~ 

But none of those fail, either. They all just do:

~~~
# terragrunt import 'aws_route_table_association.tenant_route_table_assoc["<AWS_AZ>-<SUBNET_CIDR>"]' "<ROUTE_TABLE_ID>"08012124563cdec54"

- terraform.io/builtin/terraform is built in to Terraform
- Reusing previous version of hashicorp/aws from the dependency lock file
- Using previously-installed hashicorp/aws v4.52.0

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

Import successful!

The resources that were imported are shown above. These resources are now in
your Terraform state and will henceforth be managed by Terraform.
~~~

Which is to say, it looks to be querying the (s3-hosted) remote-state file and computing valid availability zones, but not actually attempting the import. Interestingly, when it does the `data.aws_availability_zones.available` query, the returned-value is actually a region-string rather than an AZ-string. So, I'm assuming that's underpinning the "why no import". Unfortunately, I'm not exactly sure.

At any rate, Terraform and Terragrunt versions are as follows:
~~~
# terraform --version && terragrunt --version
Terraform v1.3.7
on linux_amd64
+ provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws v4.52.0
terragrunt version v0.43.1
~~~

The above is being done from within an Amazon Linux2 container-image.

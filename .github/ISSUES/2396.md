# Can CheckDependentModules be made optional to prevent Terragrunt iterating over the entire codebase on destroy?

**xynova** commented *Dec 15, 2022*

We are currently having execution hanging issues when running destroy on a stack. Digging in through the logs and code I noticed there is a sanity check when to alert when destroying a stack that is referenced by other stacks. 

Can it be made optional? Our current way around it is to do a Ctrl-C to execute the sanity check loop and jump straight to the destroy part but it is obviously a very obscure workaround.

```
	if command == "destroy" {
		terragruntOptions.CheckDependentModules = true
	}
```

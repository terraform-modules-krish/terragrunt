# The object does not have an attribute named {{ value }} with mock_outputs defined.

**Describe the bug**
Given the following Terragrunt structure:
```
.
├── module_1
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
└── module_2
    └── terragrunt.hcl
```

Where `module_2` has an explicit dependency on `module_1`.
```module_2/terragrunt.hcl
dependency "module_1" {
  config_path = find_in_parent_folders("module_1")
  mock_outputs = {
    some_derived_value = a_mock_value
  }
}

inputs = { 
    a_variable = dependency.module_1.outputs.some_derived_value
)
```

If `module_1` fails its deploy, but has a resource in it like an `azurecaf` naming resource. That `azurecaf` naming resource is created, and  the state file of `module_1` is populated with the following:
```module_1.tfstate
{
  "resources": [
    {
      "mode": "managed",
      "type": "azurecaf_name",
      "name": "subnet",
      "provider": "provider[\"registry.terraform.io/aztfmod/azurecaf\"]",
      "instances": [
        {
          "schema_version": 3,
          "attributes": {
            "clean_input": true,
            "id": "an_id",
            "name": "name-of-resource-init",
            "passthrough": false,
            "prefixes": null,
            "random_length": 0,
            "random_seed": null,
            "resource_type": "module_1_s_resource_type",
            "resource_types": null,
            "result": "the-name-of-the-resource",
            "results": {},
            "separator": "-",
            "suffixes": [
              "suffix-1",
              "suffix-2"
            ],
            "use_slug": true
          },
          "sensitive_attributes": [],
          "private": "REDACTED"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "check_results": null
}
```
The state file exists with elements in the resource list but the actual Terraform resource that `module_1` contains is not deployed due to some error and is not present in the resource list.

Now for every subsequent run of the project, during the `init` phase we can observe the following:
```terragrunt run-all init
Unsupported attribute; This object does not have an attribute named "some_derived_value"., and 1 other diagnostic(s)
```

It appears that during the init phase that due to the existence of the state file and the resources list is populated, Terragrunt attempts to resolve `some_derived_value` from the state file rather than using the mock defined in the `mock_outputs` block.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior, code snippets and examples which can be used to reproduce the issue.
1. Assuming the module structure above.
2. Make a configuration error that results in `module_1` failing to deploy the Terraform resource.
3. Run `terragrunt run-all init`.
4. Observe that `module_1` failed to deploy, but its `azurecaf` naming resource was created.
5. Fix configuration error for `module_1`.
6. Run `terragrunt run-all init`.

You should see the error now.

**Expected behavior**
Terragrunt checks the resources list and verifies if the Terraform resource is deployed by checking the type of the element. 

**Versions**
- Terragrunt version: 1.5.3
- Terraform version: 0.46.1
- Environment details (Ubuntu 20.04, Windows 10, etc.):
  - Ubuntu 23.04

A workaround for this issue is to delete the state file of `module_1` and re-run `terragrunt run-all init`

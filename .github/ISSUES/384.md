# Relative paths within modules excluding "source" parameter

**ChineduUzoka** commented *Nov 30, 2017*

I have a lambda module that requires the code for the lambda module to be stored of the root of the project code.  

```
locals {
{tf project root}}/lambda_code/source......
}
```

However when using terragrunt on OSX it replaces the project root with the tmp directory root

Is there a way in referencing the projects root directory
<br />

Search the [Terragrunt docs](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt) for "double-slash", as that will probably do what you need.

If not, make the project root a variable, and use [extra_arguments](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt#keep-your-cli-flags-dry) to set that variable to something like [get_parent_tfvars_dir](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt#get_parent_tfvars_dir).

Hope the above helped. Closing due to lack of activity.

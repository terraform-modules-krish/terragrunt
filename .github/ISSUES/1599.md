# Terragrunt Not Finding SSO Credentials 

**ghost** commented *Mar 19, 2021*

I can't reopen issues, this is a carry forward from #1129.

# Environment

My `~/.aws/config`:

```
[default]
region = us-east-1

[profile AdministratorAccess-ACCT]
sso_start_url = https://mysso.awsapps.com/start
sso_region = us-east-1
sso_account_id = ACCT
sso_role_name = AdministratorAccess
region = us-east-1
output = json
```

My shell: 
```
$ echo $AWS_PROFILE
AdministratorAccess-ACCT

$ aws sts get-caller-identity
{
    "UserId": "A....m",
    "Account": "ACCT",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:sts::ACCT:assumed-role/AWSReservedSSO_AdministratorAccess_0....."
}
```

Versions:
```
$ terraform -version
Terraform v0.14.8
+ provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws v3.29.0
...
$ terragrunt -version
terragrunt version v0.28.11
```

# Experience

```
$ terragrunt init
ERRO[0006] /home..../terragrunt.hcl:4,46-65: Error in function call; Call to function "get_aws_account_id" failed: NoCredentialProviders: no valid providers in chain. Deprecated.
	For verbose messaging see aws.Config.CredentialsChainVerboseErrors. 
ERRO[0006] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1 
```
The `terragrunt.hcl` in question has:

```
remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    bucket         = "terraform-state-${get_aws_account_id()}"
    key            = "my_project/${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    encrypt        = true
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-state"
  }
}
```

Thanks for reporting. We are too buried to dig into this right now, so if anyone has some cycles and can figure out what the issue is, a PR is very welcome!

Have you tried adding `profile` to your remove_state configuration?

```
remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    bucket         = "terraform-state-${get_aws_account_id()}"
    key            = "my_project/${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    encrypt        = true
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-state"
    profile          = "AdministratorAccess-ACCT"
  }
}
```

This works for me.

It could be because your are using get_aws_account_id() ... maybe try removing that function and place the account number there as a test to see if it works without it.

Originally my issue was caused by out of date Terragrunt/Terraform - this was my bad. 

I am still seeing slightly weird errors. Terragrunt picks up the SSO credentials, however I get the following error:

```
Initializing the backend...
â•·
â”‚ Error: error configuring S3 Backend: error validating provider credentials: error calling sts:GetCallerIdentity: ExpiredToken: The security token included in the request is expired
â”‚       status code: 403, request id: 2a5a9af7-4258-4674-a874-37b21605fa4b
â”‚ 
â”‚ 
â•µ
```

Running `aws sts get-caller-identity` returns my UserID/Account as expected ðŸ¤” 

This is Terraform 0.15.0 and Terragrunt 0.28.24

---

**EDIT: caused by outdated Tf/Tg!**

I am seeing this as well. My `terragrunt.hcl` is as follows: 

```
remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  generate = {
    path      = "backend.tf"
    if_exists = "overwrite"
  }
  config = {
    profile = "project"
    bucket  = "project-dev-terraform-state"
    key     = "dev/${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
    region  = "eu-west-1"
    encrypt = true
  }
}
```

And the debug output is:

As you can see, I'm running Terragrunt 0.14.8 and Terraform 0.26.2. I've removed some paths with internal names in them. 

I did also set `AWS_PROFILE` but it seems Terragrunt is expecting 'actual' credentials to check/create the state bucket.

If you are using an AWS SSO profile you will need to upgrade to Terragrunt 0.28.9 or later.  [SSO wasn't supported until 0.28.9](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.28.9) and is why you are seeing this error.  Related to #1129, #1537 

Though I will say... there appears to still be an issue with setting the remote_state bucket policy/parameters when using an AWS SSO profile.  I will be opening an issue for that.

Agreed. This is what I observed after updating my versions.

Closing as we now have the follow up ticket for the specific issue reported above: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1650

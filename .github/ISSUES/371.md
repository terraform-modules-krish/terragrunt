# locks don't timeout as advertised

**ghost** commented *Nov 14, 2017*

I have a template with a lock that seems to be perma-locked.  For several days, it has just blocked on "Acquiring state lock. This may take a few moments..."

However, I have NEVER run anything without -lock-timeout=20m in the command.  However, a command did get interrupted by network loss on the day when the lock got locked.  I'm guessing acquiring the lock and setting the timeout are somehow not part of the same atomic operation?  I'm using the following in my top-level terraform.tfvars file:

```
  remote_state {
    backend = "s3"

    config {
      bucket = "<redacted>"
      key    = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
      region = "us-west-2"
      encrypt = true
      dynamodb_table = "terraform-lock-table"
    }

  terraform {
    extra_arguments "common_vars" {
      commands = ["${get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars()}"]

      optional_var_files = [
        "${get_tfvars_dir()}/${find_in_parent_folders("account.tfvars", "skip-account-if-does-not-exist")}",
        "${get_tfvars_dir()}/${find_in_parent_folders("region.tfvars", "skip-region-if-does-not-exist")}",
        "${get_tfvars_dir()}/${find_in_parent_folders("env.tfvars", "skip-env-if-does-not-exist")}",
        "${get_tfvars_dir()}/terraform.tfvars"
      ]
    }

    extra_arguments "retry_lock" {
      commands = ["${get_terraform_commands_that_need_locking()}"]
      arguments = ["-lock-timeout=20m"]
    }
  }
}
```

What is particularly obnoxious is that I can't even exit the process normally.  It captures the ctl-C and just swallows it while it blocks on the lock:

If I reduce the timeout, I get the following when it finally times-out

```

Terraform acquires a state lock to protect the state from being written
by multiple users at the same time. Please resolve the issue above and try
again. For most commands, you can disable locking with the "-lock=false"
flag, but this is not recommended.

So how do I actually remove the lock? I ran commands with -lock=false, which works, but it doesn't remove the perma-locked lock.  I can't just have that entire module blow up without ignoring the lock forevermore.

Terragrunt does not do locking. Locking is done by Terraform itself. My best guess is that if you lost connectivity during some previous `apply`, that something with the lock got messed up, and stale data is sitting around in your DynamoDB table. You can try cleaning it out by hand. If you can't get it resolved, please file a bug with Terraform itself, as Terragrunt just forwards your lock settings to it directly!

Sorry, I actually thought I was on the terraform github.  I must have grabbed the wrong tab.

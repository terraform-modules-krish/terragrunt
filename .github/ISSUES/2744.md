# feat: Add support for all the assume-role attributes in the S3 remote state block

**asvinours** commented *Oct 4, 2023*

**Describe the solution you'd like**

Add support for extra assume-role attributes for S3 remote_state backend.

Right now it looks like terragrunt supports `role_arn`, `external_id`  and `session_name` but not the session duration, the session policy nor the session tags attributes.

terraform s3 backend documentation: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/s3#assume-role-configuration

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

One alternative is to not use the terragrunt `remote_state` block and use a `generate` block and generate a terraform file for the backend configuration. Although doing this takes away the automatic deployment of the S3 bucket and dynamoDB table.

# Deprecate, remove, and replace `dependencies` block

**yorinasub17** commented *Oct 13, 2021*

With the introduction of `dependency` blocks, the functionality of `dependencies` is less useful as it is an implicit list of configurations. To avoid confusion, we should deprecate and remove the `dependencies` block.

Before removing however, there is one use case for `dependencies` block where it allows a concise representation of multiple dependencies. We should consider replacing the `dependencies` block by adding support for `for_each` to `dependency` blocks. E.g.:

```
dependency "all_deps" {
  for_each    = ["../vpc", "../mysql", "../redis"]
  config_path = each.value
}
```

## Motivation

Currently, we use the old `dependencies` block for the `configstack` graph representation. This was done to speed up development of the `dependency` blocks, but has led to a few headaches, the latest one being https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1852. We should take this opportunity to remove the `dependencies` block and consolidate the dependency handling logic around the internal representation of `dependency` blocks.

I just ran across this ticket while investigating long startup times for terragrunt.  If I understand correctly, the two would provide the same functional and performance impact:
```
dependencies {
  paths = ["../vpc", "../mysql", "../redis"]
}

dependency {
  for_each     = ["../vpc", "../mysql", "../redis"]
  config_path  = each.value
  skip_outputs = true
}

Out of curiosity, does it work if the value contains double quotes?

```
export VARS_FILE='"${get_tfvars_dir()}/../../common.tfvars"'
```

That produces this error:

```sh

lol, that's not a very helpful error message. Not sure what the issue is, but clearly Terragrunt's somewhat hacky way of handling interpolations is failing here. 

What is your use case, BTW? Why pass in something via env var that then needs to be dynamically interpolated?

The reason was to try making #305 work

This should have been fixed as part of the upgrade in [v0.19.0](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.19.0) to support Terraform 0.12 and HCL2.

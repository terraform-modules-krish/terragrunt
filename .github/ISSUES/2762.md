# inputs should be exported as environment variables

According to this:

https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/inputs/

_Whenever you run a Terragrunt command, Terragrunt will set any inputs you pass in as environment variables._

Anything supplied as inputs should be available as environment variable:

Parent `terragrunt.hcl`:

```hcl
terraform {
  extra_arguments "cleanup cloudwatch_log_group" {
    commands = ["destroy"]
    env_vars = {
      TG_ACCOUNT_NAME = "${get_env("TF_VAR_account", "")}"
      TG_AWS_REGION   = "${get_env("TF_VAR_awsregion", "")}"
    }
  }
}
```

Child `terragrunt.hcl`:
```hcl
include "root" {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}
inputs = {
  account      = "capdev"
  awsregion    = "us-east-1"
  cluster_name = "testdev-use1"
}
```

but not happening:

```
$ terragrunt destroy; env | grep TG_

No changes. No objects need to be destroyed.

Either you have not created any objects yet or the existing objects were
already deleted outside of Terraform.

Destroy complete! Resources: 0 destroyed.
$
$ env | grep TG_
```

Hello,
environment variables are passed to invoked Terraform and aren't persisted to current shell

Simplified example in: https://github.com/denis256/terragrunt-tests/tree/master/issue-2762

```terraform
#main.tf
resource "null_resource" "script" {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "/bin/bash 46521694.sh"
  }
}
```

```bash
# 46521694.sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
env
```

Approach is to invoke `env` from script during `terraform` execution

`terragrunt apply` output:
```
...
null_resource.script (local-exec): TG_ACCOUNT_NAME=test_account_name
null_resource.script (local-exec): TG_AWS_REGION=test_aws_region
null_resource.script (local-exec): TF_VAR_account=capdev
null_resource.script (local-exec): TF_VAR_awsregion=us-east-1
null_resource.script (local-exec): TF_VAR_cluster_name=testdev-use1

...
```

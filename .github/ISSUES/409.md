# Terragrunt doesn't work correctly with asdf installer

**brikis98** commented *Jan 27, 2018*

After installing Terragrunt with `asdf`, the `plan` command fails:

```
> terragrunt plan

[...]

[terragrunt] 2018/01/26 17:40:01 Downloading Terraform configurations from git::ssh://git@github.com/[redacted]/[redacted].git?ref=v0.0.1 into [redacted] using terraform init

[...]

2018/01/26 17:40:01 Running command: terraform init [redacted]
No version set for terraform
[terragrunt] 2018/01/26 17:40:02 exit status 255
```

@tomdavidson Any idea what could cause this? Some sort of sandboxing by asdf?

I've removed the Linux package manager installers from the README for now, since they both seem to have bugs: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/commit/beb3c8e70eb2c7430ea1b0db32cc14ba5f2c55cf

Shoot. Sorry It was not a good experience for you.  I am using it in my CI/CD pipeline and on my workstations, but they are in the Debian family. The asdf terraform plugin has had much broader usage.

> No version set for terraform

Did you set the version either global or local? ie `asdf (global|local) transform 0.11.2` does terraform and terragrunt version return the expect versions?

>  Some sort of sandboxing by asdf?

It installs the binaries outside of your shell's path and then sets aliases based on the $HOME/.tool-versions or $PWD/.tool-versions. I have a Tectonic project that can not use Terraform 0.11.x so that project has a .tools-versions file with 0.10.8 but other projects I am working on are using current. My CI runners use asdf too, so the expected version is always used - not just an installer.

No worries! Bugs happen :)

@jeffutter Could you provide more details on the issue you saw?

The [plugin pr](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-plugins/pull/19) has been accepted so it can now be installed without listing the git repo  ie
```shell
$ asdf  plugin-add terragrunt
```

@jeffutter @brikis98  I never heard any details concerning the "bug" - is it a bug if there is no confirmation or details?

@jeffutter If you have a min, it would be great if you could try again with `asdf`. Thx!

Yeah, sorry for not replying sooner. I think the issue was mostly on my end.

I forgot that I don't usually start asdf with my shell. I just `source /usr/local/opt/asdf/asdf.sh` when I need a specific version of something.

I think what happens then is `asdf` puts it's shims on my `PATH` and sets some other context to know what version of terraform the shims reference.

When `terragrunt` then launches it starts a subshell which preserves the altered PATH but loses whatever the asdf stubs use to tell it what version to use thus `No version set for terraform`. I imagine it would work just fine if I load `asdf` when my shell starts.

**;tldr** An issue with my own setup/workflow. Feel free to close.

Ah, thanks for the explanation @jeffutter! I'll close this issue.

@tomdavidson Would you mind putting the `asdf` instructions back in the docs?

# plan-all hides errors

**shaharmor** commented *Jul 5, 2017*

Hey,

When using `plan-all`, if one of the internal modules has a parsing/validation error it will be hidden and not shown by `plan-all`.

Example:
For this module:
```hcl
resource "aws_route53_zone" "main" {
  name   = "${var.domain_name}"
  vpc_id = "${aws_vpc.main.id}"
}

resource "aws_route53_zone" "main" {
  name   = "${var.domain_name}"
  vpc_id = "${aws_vpc.main.id}"
}
```

There is an error because the two resources have the same name, but running `plan-all` won't show it. (Running `plan` will).

<br />

What does the command do in that case? Does it show any messages? Could you paste some example log output?

The `plan` command shows this:

```
1 error(s) occurred:

* module root: 1 error(s) occurred:

* aws_route53_zone.main: resource repeated multiple times
```

`plan-all` shows this:

```

And the error doesn't appear anywhere in the log output above?

**shaharmor** commented *Jul 7, 2017*

Nope.
There is only 1 line after the plan command and I pasted it

Hmph, sorry about that, must be a bug. Not sure why the output is getting lost, but if anyone wants to dig in, PRs are very welcome.

I believe this was fixed by #277.

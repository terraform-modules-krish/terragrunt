# Feature request: support latest version when using `tfr` protocol in `terraform.source`

**Describe the solution you'd like**

> Use case: when using the `tfr` protocol in `terraform.source`, do not pin the module version in every single `terragrunt.hcl` configuration; only pin module versions in production configurations.
>
> Imagine you have 50 `terragrunt.hcl` configurations and a the `terraform.source` attribute needs to be bumped across all of them following a module release.
>
> Even using Renovate, Dependabot, or custom workflows triggered by module releases via a webhook (for example via [Spacelift's notification policy](https://docs.spacelift.io/concepts/policy/notification-policy)) seems like unnecessary automation for non-production environments.

Right now, the `version` URI query parameter must be specified when supplying a URI with the `tfr://` protocol.

```hcl
terraform {
  source = "tfr:///terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws?version=3.5.0"
}
```

Otherwise, an error is raised:

https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/df9f8792c33920dece415c26edbd9e1415aca585/internal/tfr/getter.go#L105-L110

This differs from vanilla Terraform in that the `version` attribute is optional. 

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
}
```

Granted, in vanilla Terraform, since `version` is its own HCL attribute, it neither has to exist nor be a pure semantic version. It can be a version constraint such as `~> 3.0`. Given `version` being optional and and also the possibility to supply version constraints, I can only assume that it has an additional phase where it makes use of the [version query endpoint](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/registry/api-docs#list-available-versions-for-a-specific-module), then uses that constraint (or lack thereof) to determine the latest permissible version and then download it via [this endpoint](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/registry/api-docs#download-source-code-for-a-specific-module-version). Interestingly, I couldn't get the [get the latest version of a module](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/registry/api-docs#download-the-latest-version-of-a-module) endpoint to work with all private registries, namely the [Spacelift module registry](https://docs.spacelift.io/vendors/terraform/module-registry).

I tried finding the actual implementation of this in https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform but I think it'll take me less time to make a PR to this repo than to find it... 

In any case, I propose lifting the hard requirement of a `version` parameter in the `tfr/getter` implementation in Terragrunt. If `version` is missing, `tfr/getter` can make use of the [version query endpoint](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/registry/api-docs#list-available-versions-for-a-specific-module) to determine the latest version of the module.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

There are a few options here:

1. *what I am proposing* — lift the hard `version` requirement in the `tfr://` URI and make use of the [version query endpoint](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/registry/api-docs#list-available-versions-for-a-specific-module) if it is not supplied.
1. Do nothing — the `tfr://` URI should exactly conform to [the download module source endpoint](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/registry/api-docs#download-source-code-for-a-specific-module-version).
1. Have the `tfr://` URI should conform to the [get the latest version of a module endpoint](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/registry/api-docs#download-the-latest-version-of-a-module) (but see my earlier notes of this endpoint not working for Spacelift, for example).
1. Make the `version` like the HCL attribute in vanilla Teraform — I wouldn't recommend this because the URI will probably not be able to support version constraints such as `~> 3.0`, and also we would have to implement our own version constraint resolution mechanism inside of Terragrunt. Lastly, this would be misleading as a `tfr://` URI because the Terraform registry API won't support version constraints inside the URI. All of this sounds awful.

I'm also hitting this - I expected version=~> 1.2.3 to work (or escaping the > and space) but… it seems to get

        * error downloading 'tfr://...?version=~+0.0.20': Error downloading module from .../~%!.(MISSING)20/download: error receiving HTTP data

need _some_ mechanism to specify version constraints

# terragrunt.hcl full arg documentation

**jeffdyke** commented *Jan 20, 2020*

I'm really hoping i'm going to be pointed at an RTFM link, but i'm not finding this item.  What are all of the argument options that are allowed in `terragrunt.hcl`, what is allowed in the `terraform` block, only the `config_path` or can there be more.  I'm using terragrunt and am a big fan, but am looking for what more i can take advantage of.  I'll take a look at the code that parses terragrunt.hcl but i don't know go if at all.  I'd be happy to contribute this change to a readme.

Thanks for the great software!

I did got to SO first, as documented, and answered a question, but that is a pretty dry resource at this point. FWIW

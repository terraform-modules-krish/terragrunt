# Tests require clean AWS credentials

**kevinburke** commented *Oct 31, 2017*

The tests require AWS credentials that don't have access to other services (in order to be safe). This can be painful and/or expensive to set up.

It would be great if the AWS-specific tests used the `testing.Short()` helper to exit early if you run in short mode.

# Support Terraform 1.3.x functions startswith and endwith

**oscarmorasu** commented *Oct 13, 2022*

I am using terragrunt version v0.39.1

The [documentation](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/built-in-functions/#terraform-built-in-functions) says: 

> All [Terraform built-in functions](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/functions.html) are supported in Terragrunt config files

I am using Terraform 1.3, which introduced introduced the [startwith](https://www.terraform.io/language/functions/startswith) and [endwith](https://www.terraform.io/language/functions/endswith) functions, but they are not supported in Terragrunt yet.

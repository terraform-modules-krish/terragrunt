# Terragrunt state files custom location

**marcuswl345** commented *Dec 27, 2017*

Hi,

I'm very new to terraform and terragrunt.

When you deploy via terragrunt(with backend as local) state files are stored in a random under the .terragrunt folder. Can we change it so that terragrunt stores the state files where the terraform.tfstate files are located at?

I want to mirror how terraform stores the state files locally

Thank you
<br />

I'm not sure this workflow makes sense with Terraform. If you delete the code, then you can't run `terraform destroy`, as without that code, Terraform won't know what to destroy!

Terraform does not download state files to disk (at least as over version 0.10.x or so); it only keeps them in memory. So again, it's not clear how this workflow is going to work.

Hi @brikis98 

I have changed my question to reflect what I'm trying to do

Can you use the [path](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/local.html#path) parameter with [get_tfvars_dir()](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt#get_tfvars_dir)?

That works. 

Thanks @brikis98

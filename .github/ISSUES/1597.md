# Dependencies vs dependency

**phatcher** commented *Mar 19, 2021*

If I have `dependency` blocks, do I also have to restate their paths in a `dependencies` block to get correct behaviour from `run-all`.

Reason I ask is that the docs aren't particularly clear on this and it would clean up by hcl files if I could remove the dependencies block

No, you only need one or the other.

ty - that will tidy up my config a fair bit and avoid duplication

Should I propose a doc change?

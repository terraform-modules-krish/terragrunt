# AWS Auth Doc - IAM - remove s3 object level actions for bucket resource

**Kiran01bm** commented *Apr 17, 2023*

The [AWS Auth Documentation page here](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/aws-auth/#aws-iam-policies) contains s3 object level actions (SID:`AllowCreateAndListS3ActionsOnSpecifiedTerragruntBucket`) such as `GetObject` and `PutObject` on the s3 bucket resource which is not required.

Hi @Kiran01bm, 

Thanks for opening this issue. To ensure I'm on the same page as you, could you tell me why you think `GetObject` and `PutObject` are not required permissions?

I tested it on my environment, and removing `GetObject/PutObject` for `"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME"` don't cause any issues

This is because `GetObject` and `PutObject` are object-level actions. But the resource in the statement is the bucket. Bucket actions and object actions use different resource arns. The second statement `AllowGetAndPutS3ActionsOnSpecifiedTerragruntBucketPath` includes `GetObject` and `PutObject` for object-level resources...

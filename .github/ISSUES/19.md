# Add the ability to set persistent locks on a configuration

Would like the ability to lock/unlock a configuration from further changes.

Ah, neat idea. It should be fairly easy to add a `terragrunt lock` command. 

Out of curiosity, what is your use case?

We are (currently) splitting up the configurations for the network and compute components and would probably consider locking the underlying infrastructure that compute configurations are built on top of.

Is anyone interested in submitting a PR for this? All the code for the locking mechanism is already in place, so all you'd need to do is expose a new command in the CLI.

# Include parent config by feeding variables from child config

**gopipara** commented *Jan 14, 2022*

Hi Terragrunt team. 

Terragrunt helps us a lot in our infrastructure provisioning. I couldn't get an implementation working using `include` block (which includes parent terragrunt.hcl config) in child terragrunt.hcl and feeding variables to parent config from child, so the parent config is not duplicated and still customizable. I couldn't find any helpful information in the documentation regarding this. Can anyone please shed some light into this. Thank you. 

I have a dir structure below
```
├── modules
│   ├── main.tf
│   ├── outputs.tf
│   └── variables.tf
├── projects
│   ├── project1
│   │   ├── bastion.tfvars
│   │   └── terragrunt.hcl
│   └── project2
│       ├── buckets.tfvars
│       ├── gke.tfvars
│       └── terragrunt.hcl
└── terragrunt.hcl
```

- Parent `terragrunt.hcl` has below config
```
terraform_version_constraint = "= 0.15.5"
terragrunt_version_constraint = "= 0.35.19"

remote_state {
  backend = "gcs"

  config = {
    credentials = local.authentication_json_file
    bucket = local.bucket
    location = local.location
    prefix = path_relative_to_include()
  }
}

terraform {
  source = "${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/modules"
  extra_arguments "var_files" {
    commands = get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars()
    required_var_files = fileset(get_terragrunt_dir(), "*.tfvars")
  }
}
```
- Child `terragrunt.hcl`'s has below config
```
include  "root" {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
  merge_strategy = "deep"
}

locals {
  authentication_json_file = "~/Downloads/test.json"
  bucket = "test"
  location = "us-west1"
}

inputs = {
  authentication_json_file = local.authentication_json_file
  region = "us-west1"
  project_id = "test"
}
```

With the above config, being in `project1`  dir and running `terragrunt init --terragrunt-log-level debug` errored out as below
```

`include` only goes one way - that is, the child config can access the parent, but the parent can not access the child data like a two-way `include`.

There is one exception to this, which is `dependency` access in a `deep` merge config for the `include`, where the parent can reference `dependency` blocks of children.

The typical way you deal with child configurations merging upward is by explicitly importing it into the parent context with `file` or `read_terragrunt_config`. Note that there is cycle detection, so you can't straight up import the child into the parent (e.g., `read_terragrunt_config("${get_terragrunt_dir()}/terragrunt.hcl")` will **not work**). Instead, you rely on data files in your directory structure that control what happens in the parent config based on where you are running the config.

See https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example for an example of this in action, specifically how the root config materializes the account, region, and environment information based on which folder the child config lives in: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example/blob/master/terragrunt.hcl#L8-L15

@yorinasub17 , thanks for your prompt response. Live examples you provided are very helpful. I was able to get my use-case working by following those.

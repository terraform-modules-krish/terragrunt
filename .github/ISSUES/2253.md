# Support credentials configured in .terraformrc for tfr sources

**JanKoppe** commented *Aug 24, 2022*

Hi,

when trying to invoke modules directly from a custom terraform registry that requires authentication, Terragrunt does not respect the credentials configured in `~/.terraformrc`. For example:

```
# ~/.terraformrc

credentials "gitlab.example.tld" {
  token = "***"
}
```

```
# terragrunt.hcl

terraform {
  source = "tfr://gitlab.example.tld/library/my-module/aws?version=1.0.0"
}
```

```
$ terragrunt --version                                           
terragrunt version v0.38.7
$ terragrunt plan --terragrunt-log-level debug --terragrunt-debug
...
WARN[0001] No double-slash (//) found in source URL /library/my-module/aws. Relative paths in downloaded Terraform code may not work.

```

When intercepting the traffic using mitmproxy I can see that the authorization bearer token is missing.

It seems that the code currently only handles loading the token directly from an environment variable: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/internal/tfr/getter.go#L269

It would be much nicer if Terragrunt would also respect the configured credentials from the `~/.terraformrc`.

I think I just duplicated https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1771 by accident. Will close in favor of that one.

# [Feature Request] Terragrunt show-all CLI command

**marshall7m** commented *Feb 2, 2021*

Feature:
Incorporate the ability to run `terragrunt show-all` from the CLI.  

Using `terragrunt show-all -json plan.json` will search for a `plan.json` file for each subfolder within the stack.

Use Case:
I'm currently working on a Terragrunt testing python helper that parses the terragrunt CLI output. After running `terragrunt plan-all -out plan.json` it would be great if I can use `terragrunt show-all -json plan.json`  to capture each of the subfolder's plan.json and parse it into a python nested dict for testing.

aha running `terragrunt run-all show` with  terragrunt v0.28.1 does the trick!

# mock outputs being used during apply instead of the actual values

Hi,

I set up an example app to reproduce the issue. In this app, the mock outputs are being used instead of the actual values during apply. But based on the documentation https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/execute-terraform-commands-on-multiple-modules-at-once/, these mock outputs should only be relevant during a validate or plan. When i run apply, it should use the actual outputs of running terraform apply on the dependency. 

Here's the dependency module:

https://github.com/Infinite-Limit-Data-Science-LLC/aws-bootstrap

Here is the module being provisioned in terragrunt:

https://github.com/Infinite-Limit-Data-Science-LLC/aws-s3-terrabug

And here is the Terragrunt project:

https://github.com/Infinite-Limit-Data-Science-LLC/terrabug-s3

Notice in examples/basic-usage in aws-s3-terragrunt, if you run terraform apply, everything works and bucket is created with proper properties. However, in terragrunt project, terrabug-s3, when I run terragrunt apply, it produces an error, because it appears to be using the mock outputs, which are supposed to be temporary values only:

> │ Error: Error putting S3 replication configuration: InvalidArgument: Invalid ReplicaKmsKeyID ARN. │ status code: 400, request id: 7WPMAEAH5Y0574QT, host id: aNZfserXWz0dPHvZCDMYFDXOyRHVux9+WAxUxSDFiw109X0uOY7vXchm7cWL4lwX0+VqzPNqexE= │ │ with module.bucket.aws_s3_bucket.mybucket, │ on s3/main.tf line 1, in resource "aws_s3_bucket" "mybucket": │ 1: resource "aws_s3_bucket" "mybucket" {


These projects are very small just to reproduce the issue. I hope the minimal working example is enough to galvanize interest in helping resolve the issue.

Actually, I was able to resolve the issue myself. It was loading in the wrong variables from the parent module.

# Add support for `--terragrunt-source-map` as a more consistent, predictable way to override source URLs

**yorinasub17** commented *Apr 15, 2020*

Terragrunt's `--terragrunt-source` parameter, which is designed to make it easy to override `source` URLs in `terragrunt.hcl`, has a couple issues:

1. If you run `terragrunt apply --terragrunt-source /foo/bar` in folder `yyy`, as of now, the *only* thing it does is override the `source` URL in `yyy/terragrunt.hcl` to the exact value `/foo/bar`. However, if you run `terragrunt apply-all --terragrunt-source /foo/bar` in folder `yyy`, it overrides the `source` value of each child module within `yyy/sub/path` to something like `/foo/bar/sub/path`. This inconsistency can be confusing and only gets worse when working with `read_terragrunt_config`, where we have to parse another `terragrunt.hcl` and decide whether to override its `source` URL or not.
1. `--terragrunt-source` assumes all your modules are coming from the *same* root repo. You won't be able to do an `apply-all` if you're pulling from multiple repos (e.g., your own infra modules, Terraform Registry, Gruntwork repos, etc). 

Perhaps a better solution to this is to support some sort of mapping:

```
terragrunt apply --terragrunt-source-map source:dest
```

The `--terragrunt-source-map` param would replace any `source` URL that starts with `source` to instead start with `dest`. 

For example:

```
terragrunt apply --terragrunt-source-map github.com/org/modules.git:/local/path/to/modules
```

The above would replace `source = "github.com/org/modules.git//xxx"` with `/local/path/to/modules//xxx` regardless of whether you were running `apply`, or `apply-all`, or using a `dependency`. This would give us a consistent behavior across all commands _and_ support mapping multiple repos by specifying the param multiple times:

```
terragrunt apply \
  --terragrunt-source-map github.com/org/modules.git:/local/path/to/modules \
  --terragrunt-source-map github.com/org/another-repo.git:/local/path/to/another-repo
```

We could also consider allowing users to specify this mapping in a file:

```
terragrunt apply --terragrunt-source-map mapping.hcl
```

Where `mapping.hcl` contains:

```hcl
mappings = {
  "github.com/org/modules.git"      = "/local/path/to/modules"
  "github.com/org/another-repo.git" = "/local/path/to/another-repo"  
}
```

Core feature was implemented in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.29.3, but still missing the following:

- [x] Environment variable configuration (starting `v0.29.5`)
- [ ] file based configuration

I am wondering, can this handle the immutable ref suffix if used?
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1627#issuecomment-847082445

in the example linked, there may be modules with these types of links:
```
source = "github.com/firehawkvfx/firehawk-main.git//modules/vault?ref=v0.0.20"
source = "github.com/firehawkvfx/firehawk-main.git//modules/vault-kv-init?ref=v0.0.20"
source = "github.com/firehawkvfx/firehawk-main.git//modules/vault-policies?ref=v0.0.20"
```
We would want to override all these to point at another path to test before the next release.

Yes this should work with `--terragrunt-source-map github.com/firehawkvfx/firehawk-main.git=/path/to/local/modules`. The source map feature ignores and drops query parameters when doing the mapping.

Thank you for clarifying.

First of all this is a great feature! I've got a lot of nested modules and it is a pain to test them.

Sadly I got no luck configuring that in Windows. I tried to run like `--terragrunt-source-map git::https://azuredevopsurl/_git/=C:\IaC` and it fails with "Did not find any Terraform files (*.tf)".

I compared debug logs with/without the --terragrunt-source-map argument and it seems that the "WorkingDir" variable gets a non hashed value when using --terragrunt-source-map with C:\ in the path.

Have anyone being able to use this with Windows?

Are there any plans to allow this behaviour to be configurable? e.g. `--preserve-query-parameters` or equivalent?

My use case is that I define the paths to my modules using something like 
```
git::ssh://git@gitlab.com/company/project.git?ref=1.0
```
This means a developer can check the project out and run a plan without any faffing with credentials or personal access tokens.

However, my CI runner doesn't have an SSH key, so would ideally use a path like

```
git::https://gitlab-ci-token:${CI_JOB_TOKEN}@gitlab.com/company/project.git?ref=1.0
```
I tried using TERRAFORM_SOURCE_MAP for this but unfortunately, because the query parameters are ignored, it will always point to the master branch rather than the ref specified.

Cheers!

Can you try to add to your CI `.gitconfig` the following contents like Atlantis does 
https://github.com/runatlantis/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/atlantis/values.yaml#L53 ?
I think this will solve your issue.

@angeloskaltsikis amazing! Thanks so much for the quick response, this did just the trick. I added the following as a pre-script:

```
git config --global url."https://gitlab-ci-token:${CI_JOB_TOKEN}@gitlab.com".insteadOf ssh://git@gitlab.com
```
And now no need to use TERRAFORM_SOURCE_MAP at all in the CI. Thanks a lot!

That's great to hear. I would be glad if you can add me in LinkedIn to discuss further about your CI and how do you use it :-)

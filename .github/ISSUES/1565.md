# When running in codebuild, cannot find s3 backend

**vchan2002** commented *Feb 26, 2021*

I am wrapping terragrunt around a custom shell script, but it seems that the shell script executes fine within a "regular" linux enviornment (ec2 instance, my windows WSL running debian, Mac), but not on a codebuild container.

It seems to be failing, but only on codebuild, when it's running a terragrunt plan to produce a plan

With debugging turned on, here's where I think it is failing.

Working config....

That error seems to indicate that it can't find the S3 backend, but the box has enough IAM rights.  I even put in an simple "aws s3 ls" command and it produces valid output for the account.

Okay, I figured out the root cause of the issue.  The problem is that I am also using codecommit as my code repo.  By default, it checks out both the repos with the FQDN of the codecommit URL, so the directories the code sits in is something like.  /codebuild/output/src932/src/git-codecommit.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/

It seems that when that directory path has what looks like an URL, it assumes it's an URL?  Maybe it's a terraform issue?  Not sure about this one.

as a workaround you can create a directory /code, hardlink the default directory where codebuild puts the cloned source code, then run terragrunt from the /code directory and you won't get an S3 error

```yaml
version: 0.2

phases:
  pre_build:
    commands:
      - mkdir /codebuild/output/code
      - cp -la ${CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR}/. /codebuild/output/code

  build:
    commands:
      - cd /codebuild/output/code
      - YOUR COMMAND
```
Here is a snippet how we workaround this issue. We need to create our  `code` clone on same mount point to be able to create hardlinks (the -l in cp command).

Any chance that this one is related to https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter/issues/148 ?
Just set up a custom go playground to check the url. And the "parser" given in the issue will output the error for the url. If you drop the "/codebuild/output/src932/src/" part it will work.

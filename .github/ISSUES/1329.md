# [MacOS] terragrunt console - Setctty set but Ctty not valid in child

**niranjan94** commented *Sep 7, 2020*

While trying to invoke the `terraform console` command via `terragrunt console`, 

I get the following error:

```
[terragrunt] 2020/09/07 14:30:52 Running command: terraform console
[terragrunt] 2020/09/07 14:30:52 Error closing pty: invalid argument
[terragrunt] 2020/09/07 14:30:52 Hit multiple errors:
fork/exec /usr/local/bin/terraform: Setctty set but Ctty not valid in child
[terragrunt] 2020/09/07 14:30:52 Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1
```

But this seems to work fine on Ubuntu.

**Versions:**

```
terragrunt version v0.23.40
Terraform v0.13.2
MacOS Catalina 10.15.6
```

On checking this further, this seems to be a regression. Terraform console works perfectly with terragrunt `v0.23.33`

Thanks for reporting! If anyone has some time to [browse what changed between the two versions](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/compare/v0.23.33...v0.23.40) and help us spot the bug, that would be much appreciated!

I've hit this same error recently on terragrunt `v0.24.1`. Is there something else I should be looking at here?

This issue got resolved in `v0.26.1` for me

After upgrading to version 0.26.7, I still see the same issue.  

```
$ terragrunt --version
terragrunt version v0.26.7

... 

[terragrunt] 2020/12/01 15:57:08 Error closing pty: invalid argument
[terragrunt] 2020/12/01 15:57:08 Hit multiple errors:
fork/exec /usr/local/bin/terraform: Setctty set but Ctty not valid in child
```

I downgraded to 0.23.33 to solve the bug on the current version.

Upgrading to creack/pty to 1.1.10 should do the trick. Tested on my local build and it fixed the problem.

Any progress on getting this in to the next release?

Still seeing this in terragrunt 0.28.8 on MacOS 10.15.7

Please give https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.28.13 a shot (binaries should show up shortly).

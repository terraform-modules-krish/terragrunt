# Build error, v0.21.1

**rramge** commented *Oct 30, 2019*

Hello,

I continuously run into the following error when trying to build terragrunt from the current master branch:

[rramge@ol8 terragrunt]$ go build main.go
# github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/config
../../go/src/github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/config/config_helpers.go:112:16: cannot use v (type "github.com/hashicorp/terraform/vendor/github.com/zclconf/go-cty/cty/function".Function) as type "github.com/zclconf/go-cty/cty/function".Function in assignment
[rramge@ol8 terragrunt]$ 

I tried with go1.11.13 and go1.13.3, both fresh installations and followed by 'go get -v'. I did not investigate yet if there has been a recent change in the terraform source coude, since I am a go newbie anyway. 

Cheers,

Ralf

Did you run `dep ensure` first?

No, because I wasn't aware that 'dep' exists and this step is necessary. And indeed, after installing and using it, building terragrunt works fine.

Thank you very much!

Sorry for the confusion. We haven't updated to go modules yet, and are still using `dep` for dependency management. You can tell if something is go modules compatible by looking for a `go.mod` file (and `dep` if it has `Gopkg.toml`).

This caught me too. Should the step to run `dep ensure` get added to the `CONTRIBUTING.md`? Maybe this is obvious to most - I'm admittedly new to golang - but maybe there are other contributors in my same shoes?

# Support for Terragrunt to be executed programatically

**saad-uddin** commented *Oct 15, 2022*

Hi Folks, Do we have any CDK/SDK for terragrunt, so that it can be executed programatically instead of CLI ? 
Just like terraform has this -> https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-exec/tfexec . 

Use Case : To create API's out of this, and manage infrastructure more efficiently.

Hi,
can be tried to use `RunTerragrunt` function:
https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt@v0.39.1/cli#RunTerragrunt

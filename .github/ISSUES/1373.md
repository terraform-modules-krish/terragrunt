# Attempting to background a process in after hook

**BrysonMcI** commented *Sep 25, 2020*

Hey All,

I'm attempting to do something slightly unorthodox which I'm hoping is possible using terragrunt. I'm deploying a service on Kubernetes which is completely private and the configuring it in a later module. I'm attempting to use `kubectl port-forward` to expose access to the service locally (since I can't access it it directly) in an after hook and then using that locally forwarded port in the modules that depend on this one. It doesn't seem that the hook will return while the backgrounded process is running though. 

terragrunt.hcl
```
terraform {
  after_hook "portforward_vault" {
    commands     = ["apply"]
    execute      = ["/bin/bash", "./portforward.sh", "${dependency.eks.outputs.kubeconfig_path}"]
  }
```

portforward.sh
```
#!/bin/bash
kubectl port-forward -n config-store --kubeconfig $1 service/config-store-consul-consul-server 8501:8501 &
```

Example output: (note the manual ^C interrupt to get terragrunt to continue)
```
Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

```

Is this even possible with hooks? If not I would appreciate any advice for an alternative idea.

It looks like @barryib also tried a similar approach for their issue in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/856, but also found that the hook will wait for the process to finish.

Going off that all fds needed to be closed for cmd.Wait() to return, I updated portforward.sh to this and it seems to be working well enough. Still welcome to other ideas though.

```
#!/bin/bash
exec 1<&-
exec 2<&-
kubectl port-forward -n config-store --kubeconfig $1 service/config-store-consul-consul-server 8501:8501 || true &
```

Turns out kubectl port-forward doesn't work when you close stdin, back to looking for a solution, but I don't think this is appropriate as an issue anymore having seen #856

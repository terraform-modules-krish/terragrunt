# Support new terraform plugin cache dir

**robinbowes** commented *Oct 11, 2017*

Not sure if this will work with terragrunt without changes:

https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/34956cd12449cb77db3f55e3286cd369e8332eeb/website/docs/configuration/providers.html.md#provider-plugin-cache

It would sure help me with fairly regular `Error installing provider "terraform": Get https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform-provider-terraform/: read tcp read: connection reset by peer.` errors.

I suspect it will work, since Terragrunt uses `terraform init` to download code. Have you tried it?

I tried it with the env var and it didn't seem to work. Does terragrunt sanitise the env under which it runs terraform?

I'll try with the config file setting.

Nope, as far as I know, all env vars get passed through as-is. Env vars are how we handle AWS creds and those work just fine.

Are you on a new enough version of Terraform? This plugin cache dir was added very recently.

**robinbowes** commented *Oct 12, 2017*

Yes, latest version. 0.10.7.

I can confirm it works OK with the config file option.

Does the env var work if you use Terraform directly, without Terragrunt?

hi, 

I tested and terragrunt does not interfere with the `TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR` terraform env var.
Just make sure you actually clean the existing terragrunt cache folder to see the benefit of the provider cache immediately.

Terraform claims in the doc that `When possible, Terraform will use hardlinks or symlinks to avoid storing a separate copy of a cached plugin in multiple directories` but i could only observe hard copies when using with terragrunt.

@brikis98 : would you have in mind any specific behavior of terragrunt that would prevent using links ?

**brikis98** commented *Feb 19, 2018*

I'm not aware of anything in Terragrunt that would affect that, but I'm not sure what logic Terraform uses for provider caching. 

Do symlinks work for you when using purely Terraform?

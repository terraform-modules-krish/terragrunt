# order of 'all' cmds?

Hello, does the all cmds such as apply-all process found plans in the alpha numerical order?

No, Terragrunt looks for a `dependencies` property in your `terraform.tfvars` file that explicitly declares a given Terraform Configuration's dependencies. See more info in the [docs](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt#dependencies-between-modules).

Thank you for the quick response. Im aware of the dependency feature (very nice) but this question is about peers and not dependencies.

What is the order of processing if I have 10 plans that do not depend on each other?

Ah, thanks for the clarification. In that case, any "peers" or modules that don't depend on each other will execute in parallel!

# render-json command should create separate json files in sub folders when run with run-all command

**leiarenee** commented *Jan 11, 2022*

When render-json command is ran with run-all it overwrites the same file. Separate files for each terragrunt sub folders should be created in same way terragrunt-debug.tfvars.json is done.
Or Each sub folder should be added under different node name having the folder name relative to include path.

I ran into this today as well. I wanted to render json so I could build an aggregate report based on metadata. Whatever runs last clobbers the file.

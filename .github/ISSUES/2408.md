# Unable to delete the S3 backend

**tomerleib** commented *Jan 8, 2023*

Hi, 
Are any specific permissions set for both DynamoDB and S3 for the backend?
After I ran the `terragrunt plan,` I could see the confirmation to create the bucket and the bucket's name in TG stdout.
When I listed the buckets in my account, I could not see the bucket, not the DynamoDB table.

Attempting to list the bucket from the CLI returned the error `AccessDenied` - so the bucket does exist, but I can't find nor delete it.
When I attempt to list a bucket that does not exist, I get the error `NoSuchBucket`, so this is quite strange.
I have full admin permissions on my account.

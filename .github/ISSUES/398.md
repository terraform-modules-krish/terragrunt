# How do I build terragrunt locally?

**robinbowes** commented *Dec 18, 2017*

I'd like to do some debugging/hacking on terragrunt but can't see how I might build it locally.

Is this possible?

R.

I get this error, which is clearly missing dependencies, but I don't know how to resolve:

```

Did you run `glide install`?
***

**robinbowes** commented *Dec 18, 2017*

Nope, it wasn't clear I needed to do that, but even having done  so I get the same error output.
***

**robinbowes** commented *Dec 18, 2017*

(I'm new to go development, in case it wasn't obvious...)
***

**brikis98** commented *Dec 18, 2017*

No worries, I appreciate the effort :)

Have you used Go before? Are you familiar with `GOPATH`?
***

**robinbowes** commented *Dec 18, 2017*

I am aware that GOPATH must be set, and mine is set to: `/Users/robin/Workspace/golang`

I have terragrunt checked out to `/Users/robin/Workspace/terragrunt`

It seems that `glide install` is not installing the gruntwork libraries into `vendor/`:

```
  glide list

OK, I think I'm good - I needed to checkout this repo into `$GOPATH/src/github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt`. I can now build terragrunt.
***

**robinbowes** commented *Dec 18, 2017*

I spoke too soon...

I can run `go build` or `go install` to create a new terragrunt binary, but it doesn't seem to contain the changes I've made to `configstack/stack.go`.

Do I need to do something special to get my changes to be included?
***

**brikis98** commented *Dec 18, 2017*

Can you do `go run main.go` now?
***

**brikis98** commented *Dec 18, 2017*

Also, check where you're running terragrunt from after `go build`. You might be picking it up from your default `PATH`, rather than where `go build` puts it, in which case you're just running an officially published version.

It's now working - might have been a stale hashed location.

# Handling cross account dependencies

**AkshayBz** commented *Jan 2, 2022*

### Example scenario

I have created a VPC in `account-2` which is shared with `account-1`. Need to figure out a way to add dependency on the `account-2/ap-southeast-1/devops/prod/vpc` module in  `account-1/ap-southeast-1/devops/prod/bastion` since we want to access subnet IDs & what not. Unfortunately [the docs](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/work-with-multiple-aws-accounts/) don't cover this scenario

```
├── live
│   ├── account-1
│   │   └── ap-southeast-1
│   │       └── devops
│   │           └── prod
│   │               ├── bastion
│   │               └── security_group
│   └── account-2
│       └── ap-southeast-1
│           └── devops
│               └── prod
│                   └── vpc
```

### What I tried?

Using `profile` option in AWS provider. Added the following snippet to the [root `terragrunt.hcl`](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example/blob/6942725006e5f02fb1aedc3d3ea22aafb040d7d9/terragrunt.hcl#L29):
```diff
  generate "provider" {
    path      = "provider.tf"
    if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
    contents  = <<EOF
  provider "aws" {
    region = "${local.aws_region}"
+   profile = "${local.account_vars.locals.aws_profile}"
    # Only these AWS Account IDs may be operated on by this template
    allowed_account_ids = ["${local.account_id}"]
  }
  EOF
  }
```

And added the dependency like so:

```terraform
# account-1/ap-southeast-1/devops/prod/bastion/terragrunt.hcl

dependency "vpc" {
  config_path = "${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/account-2/ap-southeast-1/devops/prod/vpc"
}
```

But I was quickly met with the following error:
```
│ Error: Failed to load state: AccessDenied: Access Denied
```

I am pretty sure the credentials are set properly. I suspect that because of the way dependencies work, only a single provider is configured & not dependency specific providers like I assumed. Therefore, looking at pointers on how to work around this situation. 

I stumbled upon an example PR [using assumed roles](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example/pull/58) but I suspect it'll have the same outcome.

Possibly related: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1377

_PS: Seems like the `aws_profile` input in [account.hcl](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example/blob/6942725006e5f02fb1aedc3d3ea22aafb040d7d9/prod/account.hcl#L6) isn't used anywhere right now._

You need to configure the profile on the `remote_state` block, as that is what is used to authenticate to the backend, and the `dependency` machinery is purely reading the data out of the remote state.

# Terragrunt is always downloading the last version of the modules

**sterfield** commented *Mar 19, 2018*

# version:
- terragrunt: 0.14.2
- terraform: 0.10.8
- OS: Mac Sierra 10.12.6

# Description of the problem:
I have a module and the TF code that uses it in the same repo, in two different folders:
```
|-- environment
|   |-- common.tfvars
|   `-- development
|       |-- environment.tfvars
|       `-- region
|           |-- lambda
|               `-- terraform.tfvars
|-- modules
|   `-- services
|       `-- lambda
|           |-- main.tf
|           `-- files
|               |-- my_lambda
|                   `-- my_lambda.py
```
So in `environment`, I have the terragrunt definition with the source.
File looks like this:
```
terragrunt = {
  terraform {
    source = "../../../../modules//services/lambda"
  }
  include = {
    path = "${find_in_parent_folders()}"
  }
}
```
In `modules/services/lambda/`, I have the code TF, including the code of the lambda, in `./files/my_lambda/my_lambda.py`.
Current goal is to create a .zip file of the content of the folder, and create a lambda function with it.
The problem is, Terragrunt seems to always clean / redownload the modules. So when the python script is copied, it's a brand new file.
And it seems that even if the content is identical, the mtime / ctime being changed, the content of the .zip is a little bit different, leading to a constant change by Terraform (as the base64 + sha256 of the content of the file is different).

# Steps to reproduce:
- `terragrunt plan` is initializing the modules and the current project:
```
[terragrunt] [/environment/development/REGION/lambda] 2018/03/19 15:44:59 Running command: terraform --version
[terragrunt] 2018/03/19 15:44:59 Reading Terragrunt config file at /environment/development/REGION/lambda/terraform.tfvars
[terragrunt] 2018/03/19 15:44:59 Cleaning up existing *.tf files in ~/.terragrunt/ws7ddbWjKr5wKYL1f-brErIlnQc/KNymbeqrKscQxaFH24ABiBibWhc
[terragrunt] 2018/03/19 15:44:59 Downloading Terraform configurations from file:///REDACTED into ~/.terragrunt/ws7ddbWjKr5wKYL1f-brErIlnQc/KNymbeqrKscQxaFH24ABiBibWhc using terraform init
```
- second run of `terragrunt plan` initialize again the modules:
```
[terragrunt] [/environment/development/REGION/lambda] 2018/03/19 15:46:28 Running command: terraform --version
[terragrunt] 2018/03/19 15:46:28 Reading Terragrunt config file at /environment/development/REGION/lambda/terraform.tfvars
[terragrunt] 2018/03/19 15:46:28 Cleaning up existing *.tf files in ~/.terragrunt/ws7ddbWjKr5wKYL1f-brErIlnQc/KNymbeqrKscQxaFH24ABiBibWhc
[terragrunt] 2018/03/19 15:46:28 Downloading Terraform configurations from file:///REDACTED into ~/.terragrunt/ws7ddbWjKr5wKYL1f-brErIlnQc/KNymbeqrKscQxaFH24ABiBibWhc using terraform init
```

# Current result
As the files are brand new, the zip is re-generated, leading to a different sha256, leading to a change in Terraform

# Expected result
Modules are not re-downloaded if not necessary. This will kept the same files until they are changed or forced to be downloaded again.

Thanks for your help !

Hm, that's a bummer. If you `diff` the original and copy, can you identify a difference?

Terragrunt copies local files/folders every time so that if you change them, the next time you re-run `plan` or `apply`, you are running with the latest changes. I wonder if symlinks would work better here? You could perhaps try an experiment where you create a symlink back to your original source folder and run `terraform` (not `terragrunt`) directly in that folder to see if it works?

It occurs to me symlinks wouldn't work for remote (e.g., git) `source` URLs... But still worth experimenting.

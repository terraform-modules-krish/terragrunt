# CVEs of dependencies

**bryceml** commented *Sep 14, 2023*

**Describe the bug**
Artifactory X-Ray scans are complaining about some dependencies of terragrunt:

CVE-2023-29409 fixed in github.com/golang/go versions 1.19.12, 1.20.7, 1.21.0-rc.4 or later
CVE-2023-29406 fixed in github.com/golang/go versions 1.19.11, 1.20.6 or later

It reports the current version as 1.20.5

It looks like some of those fix versions also have other CVEs, so you likely have to go to  1.20.8, 1.21.1 to be in a good state.

XRAY-209897

This would be fixed by updating github.com/hashicorp/vault/sdk to at least 0.5.0, it reports the current version as 0.4.1

**To Reproduce**
Scan terragrunt v0.50.17 with artifactory x-ray

**Expected behavior**
terragrunt has no vulnerabilites in its dependencies in x-ray scans

**Versions**
- Terragrunt version: v0.50.17

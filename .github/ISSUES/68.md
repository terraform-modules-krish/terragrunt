# unexpected signal during runtime execution

terragrunt version: v0.5.1

This is a possible duplicate of https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/41, but I get errors that look like this on a fairly regular basis.  Any chance someone can confirm this as a duplicate, or even better provider a fix?

Sorry for the issue. I'm not sure if this is a dupe of #41, but it's no less mysterious. It looks like the `Printf` function is throwing a `panic` on [this line](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/v0.5.1/shell/run_shell_cmd.go#L14):

```go
util.Logger.Printf("Running command: %s %s", command, strings.Join(args, " "))
```

`command` is a `string`. `args` is a `...string` (array). Neither is `nil`. This may be a bug in Go.

I posted a question on the go-nuts mailing list asking for help: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-nuts/4OJz3jprF84/c8BdI0bkCwAJ

We believe we've found the culprit: https://golang.org/doc/go1.7#ports:

> Go 1.7 adds support for macOS 10.12 Sierra. Binaries built with versions of Go before 1.7 will not work correctly on Sierra.

If you're subscribed to this thread and NOT on MacOS 10.12 Sierra, please let us know. We'll update the CircleCI builds to use a more recent version of Golang soon.

OK, it looks like the most likely explanation for this issue is that our CI job was building binaries with Go 1.6.x, and apparently, those binaries will [not work with the latest version of OS X](https://golang.org/doc/go1.7#ports). I'm not on the latest OS X yet, which explains why I haven't seen these crashes!

We just updated the CI job to use Go 1.7.3. I've cut a new release and the binaries for it should be there in a few minutes: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.7.0. Please try it out and let me know if it works better for you!

Ran a terragrunt operation 100 times in a loop with no crash, looks good.  Thanks!

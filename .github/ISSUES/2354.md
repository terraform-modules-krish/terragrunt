Terragrunt have some functionality to create "global" blocks? (extra_arguments, hooks)

It means to create the same blocks on each stack,

Hi,
code that is repeating can be extracted to a common HCL file and later included  

More details in:
https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#include  (`merge_strategy`)

Hi, good point, but you have to explicitly declare the include, right? 

i guess the global hook is more useful when you want to "enforce" some blocks.

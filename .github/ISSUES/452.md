# pwd() interpolation helper

**ebarault** commented *Mar 28, 2018*

hi,

Following the additions of hooks in terragrunt, I'm looking for a way to use the absolute location where the hooks are executed to manage substitutions of vars inside a *.tfvars file located right inside terragrunt's tmp dir.

Something like a `pwd()` helper.
Also, it might not be as easy to implement as given my understanding of terragrunt sequences, interpolations are resolved before copying files in the tmp dir?

How would you solve this?

Agreed that a `get_working_dir()` helper would be useful.

Yes, though we probably know what the tmp dir will be already.

# init errors in dependencies fail to indicate source of the issue

**erpel** commented *Dec 12, 2022*

We have a setup that has multiple root modules in a folder structure and sometimes depend from one to another.

`terragrunt init` sometimes can fail in a dependency for mundane reasons. Real world examplee would be having a `.terraform.lock.hcl` with checksums for the wrong cpu archtecture lying around in it or a dynamic backend config changing due to environment differences.

When this happens, running terragrunt init in the depending folder terragrunt outputs the terraform init error without any indication 
a) that this happened during init _in a dependency_ 
b) what dependency this is coming from.

This is unfortunate as it can send you on a wild goose chase trying to figure out what is wrong with the module currently working on. Even if one remembers that it could likely be from a dependency, `terragrunt init` needs to be run again with `-terragrunt-log-level debug` to find which dependency is the problem.

Output:
```
$ terragrunt init
╷
│ Error: Backend initialization required, please run "terraform init"
│ 
│ Reason: Initial configuration of the requested backend "s3"
│ 
│ The "backend" is the interface that Terraform uses to store state,
│ perform operations, etc. If this message is showing up, it means that the
│ Terraform configuration you're using is using a custom configuration for
│ the Terraform backend.
│ 
│ Changes to backend configurations require reinitialization. This allows
│ Terraform to set up the new configuration, copy existing state, etc. Please
│ run
│ "terraform init" with either the "-reconfigure" or "-migrate-state" flags
│ to
│ use the current configuration.
│ 
│ If the change reason above is incorrect, please verify your configuration
│ hasn't changed and try again. At this point, no changes to your existing
│ configuration or state have been made.

```
Only after rerunning with debug logging enabled it's possible to find the culprit from amongst the debug log messages:
```
DEBU[0000] Running command: terraform output -json       prefix=[/folder/to/the/dependency/that/is/a/little/broken] 
╷
│ Error: Backend initialization required, please run "terraform init"

```

I'm not sure if this could be viewed as a bug, it's definitely an easy opportunity to improve user experience with probably just a single line of output.

Hello,
since https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.45.14 was implemented update in error message to include the module path

Now the error looks like this:
```
ERRO[0002] 1 error occurred:
        * [/projects/gruntwork/terragrunt-tests/dependency-output-error/module2] exit status 1
```

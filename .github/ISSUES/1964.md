# Dependency cycles 

**Iaclover** commented *Dec 29, 2021*

Hello !
I have a dependency cycle issue that is driving me crazy. 
this is the structure of my code 
```
|── deployment
│        |── module1
│        │   └── terragrunt.hcl
│        |── module2
│        │  └── terragrunt.hcl
└── ressources
│        |── module1
│        │   └── azuredeploy.tf
│        |── module2
│        │  └── azuredeploy.tf

```
The problem is the following : 

I need to access, from module 1, output values exposed by module 2 and vice versa. 
As such,   used dependency blocks in module 1 and module 2 : 

terragrunt.hcl (from module 1) looks like this 


```

terraform {
  # Deploy develop branch
  source = "the path of my 1st terraform module"

}

dependency "module2" {
  config_path = "../module2"
  mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands = ["validate", "plan"]

  mock_outputs = {
    value1 = "random_number"

  }
}
inputs={
    value1 = "random_number"
}
```

the problem is that by adding a dependency block in the 2nd terragrunt module, I have a cycle dependency. 
What should I do to break the cycle ?
thanks for your help 


<br />

Hi, 
not sure if Terragrunt has now an option to resolve dependencies cycles, most probably should be introduced another module that will output required values for `module1`/`module2`

I am facing the same thing, driving me nuts, I don't want to rewrite modules just to make it work. I am trying to switch from terraform module structure which I have no problems with, I want terragrunt to give the ci/cd flexibility for some resources that need to be applied first before other resources can (like transit gateway before private eks).
In the current loop, I am building eks node role arn in eks module, which needs to be passed to policy which then needs to be passed to km key creation with a policy which then needs to be passed back to eks module for ebs block with kms key. eventually, I included the policy data resource and kms resource in eks module using generate in terragrunt.hcl, but now I am faced with an issue that I need the arns from kms to be passed using "inputs", I am going crazy with this. I still have hopes...

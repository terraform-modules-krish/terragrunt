When I run `terragrunt plan` locally, I never encountered any issue, where the travis has problem to do the `terragrunt plan`. 

```

Post it here in case someone has the same problem.

It is only for S3 bucket object, not for anything else, like SQS, EKS stuff.

ok, it is because of lacking `s3:GetBucketObjectLockConfiguration` permission, closing the issue now.

Some relevant S3 doc, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lock-managing.html

Unfortunately, it does not show up in my IAM S3 permission config wizard, waiting for AWS customer support to get back on this.

# Option to disabling TLS verification?

**asmontas-i** commented *May 14, 2019*

Hi,

I'm trying to run terragrunt behind a proxy. It looks like before terragrunt performs any terraform action, it does some API calls to the provider and fails afterwards:

```
[terragrunt] [<...>] 2019/05/13 16:54:45 Module <...> has finished with an error: RequestError: send request failed
caused by: Post https://sts.amazonaws.com/: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority
[terragrunt] 2019/05/13 16:54:45 configstack.MultiError Encountered the following errors:

```

Is there a way to disable TLS verification in terragrunt (in plain terraform that can be done in provider block)?

Terragrunt uses the AWS Go SDK under the hood. For that matter, so does Terraform. I'm not sure what proxy settings are exposed.

@asmontas-i To get aws working, you would need to set:

```
export AWS_CA_BUNDLE=/path/to/ca-cert.pem
```

Closing as stale, and a workaround has been proposed. If this is still an issue, please open a new ticket. Thanks!

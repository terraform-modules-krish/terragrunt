# Run `terragrunt` behind proxy

**ozbillwang** commented *May 7, 2019*

Have issue to run terragrunt behind proxy. 
```
$ terragrunt plan
[terragrunt] [/var/tmp/ttt] 2019/05/07 12:38:24 Running command: terraform --version
[terragrunt] 2019/05/07 12:38:24 Reading Terragrunt config file at /var/tmp/ttt/terraform.tfvars
[terragrunt] [/var/tmp/ttt] 2019/05/07 12:38:25 Initializing remote state for the s3 backend
[terragrunt] [/var/tmp/ttt] 2019/05/07 12:38:26 [terragrunt] [/var/tmp/ttt]  Remote state S3 bucket xxx-terraform-state does not exist or you don't have permissions to access it. Would you like Terragrunt to create it? (y/n) 
^C

$ aws s3 ls s3://xxx-terraform-state
                           PRE dev/
```

Run with `terraform` by command `init, plan, apply`, no issue.

```
OS: "Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS"
```

Terragrunt uses the AWS Go SDK under the hood. Not sure why a proxy would interfere with that?

@ozbillwang
Is the ubuntu system level proxy turned on?

Feel free to redact the actual information here, but what output do you get with:
`echo "$http_proxy\n $HTTP_PROXY\n $https_proxy\n $HTTPS_PROXY\n $ftp_proxy\n $FTP_PROXY\n $no_proxy\n $NO_PROXY\n"`

If these aren't returning anything, how exactly is your proxy configured in the OS?

In the GCloud SDK, they have specific commands to configure proxies, so that any API request called will be directed first to the proxy: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/properties#proxy

If the GCloud SDK just assumed that the underlying OS would take care of it, why would they feel the need to expose those settings to the developer?

I could be completely wrong, but have been dealing a lot with GCP IAP and Proxy settings, so wanted to chime in (all built with Terragrunt of course :))

# Terragrunt should check dependencies on every command

**brikis98** commented *Aug 26, 2017*

Terragrunt supports `apply-all` and `destroy-all` commands for working with multiple modules. Since one module can depend on another module, you can specify a list of `dependencies` in your Terragrunt configuration to ensure they are applied in the correct order. 

Currently, these `dependencies` are only checked when you call a `xxx-all` command, and ignored for all other commands. This makes it easy for those lists of `dependencies` to go out of date.

Terragrunt should probably verify `dependencies` for every command. For backwards compatibility, we may want to have it off by default initially, and allow you to enable it in your Terragrunt config (e.g., `check_dependencies = true`) and via CLI param (e.g., `--terragrunt-check-dependencies`). In a few releases, we may turn it on by default.

#1927 appears related as well.

Output of `terragrunt run-all destroy` and ` terragrunt destroy` should be consistent, that includes the dependency calculation. The two are too closely related to be giving different outputs.

Here is an example from our environment:

```
02-vips  $ terragrunt run-all destroy
INFO[0000] The stack at /xyz/02-vips will be processed in the following order for command destroy:
Group 1
- Module /xyz/02-vips

WARNING: Are you sure you want to run `terragrunt destroy` in each folder of the stack described above?
There is no undo! (y/n)
```

```
02-vips  $ terragrunt destroy
Detected dependent modules:
/xyz/03-infra
WARNING: Are you sure you want to continue? (y/n)
```


The next logical step here would be to make sure that 
`terragrunt run-all destroy` tears down, sequentially from last to first, the modules that depend on it. So, if we have the following dependency tree:

m03 -> m02 -> m01
Meaning, that m03 depends on m02 and m01, and m02 depends on m01.

Then (**run-all apply**)
`m03 $ terragrunt run-all apply`
Should warn, prompt, then **stand up** m01, then m02, then m03.

AND  (**run-all destroy**)
```
$ cd ../m01
m01 $ terragrunt run-all destroy`
```
Should warn, prompt, then **destroy** m03, then m02, then m01.


I just tested this with v0.37.1

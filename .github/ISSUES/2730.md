# Terragrunt apply fails (could not find aws credentails )

**skkc2** commented *Sep 22, 2023*

Hi All,

We use Terraform and Terragrunt to manage AWS infrastructure. when I run the terragrunt locally it seems fine and no issues in deploying infrastructure but it errors out while deploying through Jenkins as no AWS creds were found and it only happens to some of the folders rest all other services in other folders deploy successfully. it was working fine till a week ago but all of a sudden there is an issue. Not sure what went wrong any suggestions pls?

Previously we used to save .terraform.lock.hcl in SCM along with terragrunt.hcl but weâ€™ve removed in some folders and there is  inconsistenyc so we've reinitailised and saved .terraform.lock.hcl in folders. is it causing issues?

Hello,
I wanted to confirm if was updated Terragrunt version? or it is the same as before?
I suspect that AWS credentials were removed from the env variables used in Jenkins job

Hi denis256,

Terragrunt and terraform remained same version in local machines and jenkins

I don't think AWS credentails removed if it was it shouldn't execute eny modules but some modules are being executed.

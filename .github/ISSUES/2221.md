# Here is where I'm trying to refresh some providers:
❯ terragrunt init -upgrade
ERRO[0001] The currently installed version of Terraform (1.2.6) is not compatible with the version Terragrunt requires (1.2.5). 
ERRO[0001] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1 
```

This is somewhat frustrating because Terraform in Brew never has prior versions.

My current work around on this is fiddling with `tfenv` to install 1.2.5 and `tgenv` to install the latest terragrunt. 📓

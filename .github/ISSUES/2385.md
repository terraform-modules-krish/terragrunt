# Public Module Support?

**anthony-delarosa-ts** commented *Dec 9, 2022*

Hello,

I am trying to provision a few resources e.x. s3 bucket and a security group in AWS and rather than re-invent the wheel I would like to use Terraform's public modules. 

I read through https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/execute-terraform-commands-on-multiple-modules-at-once/ and that works if your resources are added manually in a main.tf file but what if my main.tf file looks like this:

```
module "s3_bucket" {
  source = "git@github.com:terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-s3-bucket.git?ref=v3.6.0"

  bucket = var.s3_bucket_name
  acl    = "private"

  versioning = {
    enabled = true
  }

}

module "web_server_sg" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/security-group/aws//modules/http-80"

  name        = "ssh-web-server"
  description = "Security group for web-server with HTTP ports open within VPC"
  vpc_id      = var.vpc_id

  ingress_cidr_blocks = ["192.168.0.0/32"]
}
```

Then be able to have my terragrunt.hcl file call my private repo where I hold the _main.tf_ file above

```
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

terraform {
  source = "git@github.com:company-name/my-terraform-.git"
}

inputs = {
  aws_profile = local.aws_profile
  s3_bucket_name = "anthony-delarosa-poc-dev-test"
  vpc_id = "vpc-0123456789"
}
```

How can I use terragrunt while still take advantage of the public modules so that I don't have to manage them?
Not sure if this makes sense or not but basically I don't wanna manage my own modules because Terraform already has public modules and I would much rather just use those modules and just pass in the inputs through terragrunt.

I hope this makes sense. Thanks
<br />

hi,
can be attempted to reference module path in `terragrunt.hcl`:
```
terraform {
  source = "git@github.com:terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-s3-bucket.git?ref=v3.6.0"
}

inputs = {
  bucket = "test-bucket-1"
  acl    = "private"
  versioning = {
    enabled = true
  }
}
```
Will work in one `terraform.hcl` one terraform module

negative, that does not work actually ðŸ‘Ž because I need to use two modules

anyway, i ended up solving this issue on my own 'cause nobody else reached back and the solution is to use the following in the _terragrunt.hcl_ file: 

`terraform {
  source = "${get_terragrunt_dir()}///"
}`

and my _main.tf_ file has the following:

```
module "s3_bucket" {
  source = "git@github.com:terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-s3-bucket.git?ref=v3.6.0"

  bucket = var.s3_bucket_name
  acl    = "private"

  versioning = {
    enabled = true
  }

}

module "web_server_sg" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/security-group/aws//modules/http-80"

  name        = "ssh-web-server"
  description = "Security group for web-server with HTTP ports open within VPC"
  vpc_id      = var.vpc_id

  ingress_cidr_blocks = ["192.168.0.0/32"]
}
```

I was wondering about this kind of issue too, and it does not seem well-documented by Terragrunt yet. Let's say we want to use a public module, plus a few other supporting resources. The way I understand, the "Terragrunt" way is 1 child terragrunt.hcl == 1 terraform module. ATM I see 4 possible options, each with their own tradeoffs:

1. Call the public terraform module directly. Encapsulate the extra resources in your private module repository. The extra resources are re-usable, but a bit awkwardly coupled if they depend on the public module.

2. Call the public terraform module directly. Add a `.tf` file beside the `terragrunt.hcl` file that defines the extra resources. OK for small one-off resource creations.

3. Create a private module that encapsulates the public module and the extra resources. You will have to duplicate the public module's variables and outputs. This is the most work, but the most reusable and scalable.

4. The option @anthony-delarosa-ts mentioned above. Have Terragrunt reference a local `.tf` file that calls a public module and extra resources (or in his case, two modules).

I think the cons of adding `.tf` files in a Terragrunt project is losing the power Terragrunt functions provide. It risks introducing pockets of hardcoded duplicated configs, or brittle dependencies. Does anyone else have thoughts about these scenarios? Or about sprinkling in vanilla Terraform in a Terragrunt project?

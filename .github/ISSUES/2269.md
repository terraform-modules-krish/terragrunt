# How to design directory layout to create folders resource  by terragrunt

**wengchaoxi** commented *Sep 7, 2022*

Hi, I'm using terragrunt to create resources with dependencies: folders.

I want to know if the following design makes sense: each `terragrunt.hcl` corresponds to the folder in which it is located and the properties of that folder.
```hcl
root
 ├── folder1
 |   └── terragrunt.hcl    // used to create folder1
 └── folder2
     ├── terragrunt.hcl    // used to create folder2
     └── folder3
         └── terragrunt.hcl    // used to create folder3
```
I worry that this design will make the directory hierarchy more complex as the number of folders increases. If that's not reasonable, is there a better solution?

Thanks.

Hi,
indeed deep hierarchical structure will make core complicated to understand the project and it is quite project-specific

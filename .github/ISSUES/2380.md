# Help needed with terragrunt GO SDK 

**md-saad-uddin-ansari** commented *Dec 4, 2022*

Hi Team,

I am trying to interact with terragrunt programatically using golang sdk. (https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/cli#RunTerragrunt ) but am finding it difficult to understand how can i take this approach.

use case : 

for eg, consider this command which we run using terragrunt cli : `terragrunt run-all plan` .

now i wanna to do exactly  the same thing (and all other cmds) but via the terragrunts go pkg. I just need some help to get started, perhaps if someone can help me with a small example of how to achieve this, then i can take it from there .

This is really critical to my project, and any help is highly appreciated. thanks ! 
<br />

Hi,
examples from `integration_test.go` aren't helpful?
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/test/integration_test.go#L162

Also as an alternative, can be used `terratest` functions to launch `terragrunt`

Hi @denis256  , actually I am unable to figure out how to make it work, Hence i was looking for an working example. Is it possible for you to please help me with an working example , even a simple "terragrunt plan" example via gosdk would be enough for me to get started. 

Would really appreciate any help here, thanks a ton in advance.

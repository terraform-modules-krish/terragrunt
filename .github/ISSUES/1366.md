I called "terragrunt apply-all" under the environment folder.
Initially, it worked well and created an EC2 instance. However, the second execution results in the error as follows.

~~~
Error processing module at 'C:/Users/abc/PycharmProjects/terragrunt-study/enviroment/ec2/.terragrunt-cache/atTOD5LBQHAAgxKMQddh6R4j

What's interesting is that Linux or Mac doesn't have a problem, but it only happens with Windows 10.
My terragrunt version is v0.24.3 and terraform version is v0.13.2

How weird. Must be some sort of path issue on Windows. We don't have CI set up for Windows yet ðŸ˜• 

If someone has time to dig into this bug, a PR with a fix is very welcome!

I am facing the same problem when `plan` was executed on independently (instance leve) then next time `plan-all` executed from higher level (region)
***

**tomcart90** commented *Oct 27, 2020*

I also hit this issue today on Windows. An initial `plan-all` worked, but then once the terragrunt cache had been populated further `plan-all` actions failed with the same error that @nedaair reports.

**xmclark** commented *Oct 31, 2020*

Same issue, on windows 10. First `plan-all` or `apply-all` succeeds, but subsequent ones fail with @nedaair 's message. It seems to be resolving my generated terraform.hcl in the cache directories, and getting mad about it.

**xmclark** commented *Oct 31, 2020*

@brikis98 I've started digging, and it seems that the config module tests don't succeed without signfiicant update. Having CircleCI run windows builds would ensure these tests pass. Your CI tool supports Windows builds...is that an option?
***

**brikis98** commented *Nov 2, 2020*

Yes, CircleCi does now support Windows images, so I suspect it's possible. However, I'm not sure when our team will have time to get to it and work out all the kinks with making the CI build pass. If anyone is interested, PRs are very welcome! https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/hello-world-windows/

Also facing the same issue on Win10
***

**brandon-langley-mf** commented *Nov 21, 2020*

I was able to test and confirm that this issue at least appears to be caused because the .terragrunt-cache folders are being included and processed by *-all on subsequent runs.   I've been able to work around it by adding this to my command line:

` --terragrunt-download-dir c:\terragrunt-cache`

It would be highly valuable to get this fixed, because it's far too easy to trip over on Windows and there's no intuitive way to figure out *WHY* it's giving you a hard time.   Worse when your colleague is running on Linux having no issues with the same project :)

**brandon-langley-mf** commented *Nov 24, 2020*

This seems to be solved by https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.26.4.
***

**xmclark** commented *Nov 24, 2020*

I tried 0.26.4 windows_amd64 build and it's still broken.
***

**syz51** commented *Dec 22, 2021*

hey guys. do we have any progress on this issue? It is still happening on windows 10 at version 0.35
***

**dcvlehr** commented *Feb 3, 2022*

happening to me on v0.36.1 as well (windows 11)

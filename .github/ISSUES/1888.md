# `run_cmd` is executed twice

**adovy** commented *Oct 25, 2021*

it seems that `run_cmd` is executed twice.

terragrunt.hcl:
```terraform
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders("terragrunt.hcl")
}

locals {
  common_vars = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("terragrunt.hcl"))
}
```

Parent terragrunt.hcl:
```terraform
locals {
  test = run_cmd("python", "get_bucket.py", "production")
}
```

Output:
```
$ terragrunt init
my-production-backend-bucket
my-production-backend-bucket
ERRO[0000] Did not find any Terraform files (*.tf) in /Documents/terragrunt/test 
ERRO[0000] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1 
```

Expected behavior:
```
$ terragrunt init
my-production-backend-bucket
ERRO[0000] Did not find any Terraform files (*.tf) in /Documents/terragrunt/test 
ERRO[0000] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1 
```

I think it is executed twice because `run_cmd` is invoked in different directories, and result is cached for "command + directory"

terragrunt.hcl:
```
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders("terragrunt.hcl")
}

locals {
  common_vars = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("terragrunt.hcl"))
  common_vars2 = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("terragrunt.hcl"))
}
```

Parent terragrunt.hcl:
```
locals {
  test = run_cmd("pwd")
}
```

Execution:
```
$ terragrunt init
/tmp/run_cmd
/tmp/run_cmd/app
...
```

was printed only once "/tmp/run_cmd/app" even in locals was included `terragrunt.hcl` twice

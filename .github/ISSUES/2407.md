# Publish a gruntwork hosted Docker image of Terragrunt

**bschaatsbergen** commented *Jan 8, 2023*

It would be very nice if we can have a Docker image hosted by gruntwork. This also makes it easier for users to pipe Terragrunt in their existing pipelines, instead of having to maintain and hand-roll your own Dockerfiles/images.

I would be happy to open a PR if there's a couple of :+1: on this issue.

Hello,
it may be challenging since different users may use different combinations of Terragrunt and Terraform

I was thinking about the same but I think that we can come up with something.

Perhaps something like:
- terragrunt:latest
- terragrunt:terraform-1.3.6-terragrunt-0.42.8

Though we shouldn't publish every possible combination, optionally we could try to ship the latest terraform version together with our releases.

- terragrunt:latest
- terragrunt:v0.24.8 (which contains the latest compatible Terraform version that we are aware of)

What are your thoughts on possible tagging strategies?

In the meantime I use the alpine/terragrunt image.

In my projects, I use a single docker image with `tfenv` and `tgenv`, and depending on project configurations is selected right version.

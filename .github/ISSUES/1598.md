# S3 remote state backend does not work with Linode's S3-compatible Object Storage

**nateberkopec** commented *Mar 19, 2021*

The following remote_state config works just fine in Terraform:

```
backend = "s3"

  # https://adriano.fyi/post/2020-05-29-how-to-use-linode-object-storage-as-a-terraform-backend/
  config = {
    bucket = "foo"
    region = "us-east-1"
    endpoint = "us-east-1.linodeobjects.com"
    skip_credentials_validation = true
    access_key = "bar"
    secret_key = "baz"
  }
```

In Terragrunt, first I get this complaint:

```
Remote state S3 bucket foo does not exist or you don't have permissions to access it. Would you like Terragrunt to create it? (y/n) n
ERRO[0001] RequestError: send request failed
caused by: Get "//foo./us-east-1.linodeobjects.com?versioning=": unsupported protocol scheme "" 
```

Note the weird slash in the endpoint there.

Adding `https://` to the beginning of the `endpoint` (`https://us-east-1.linodeobjects.com`) gets me a little further:

```
Remote state S3 bucket foo does not exist or you don't have permissions to access it. Would you like Terragrunt to create it? (y/n) n
ERRO[0003] InvalidAccessKeyId: 
	status code: 403, request id: tx000000000000010584a42-006054ec61-1e5ecbf-default, host id:  
```

Is Terragrunt's s3 backend hard-coded to work only with AWS S3, and not with S3-compatible object stores?

We currently only support AWS S3.

For someone that might want to contribute:

1. What are the files in the Terragrunt source that deal with S3 backends?
2. What, in the estimation of current contributors, are the current places where Terragrunt assumes "this is actually S3" rather than "this is an S3-compatible backend"?

I believe it's mainly: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/remote/remote_state_s3.go. The code gets there via https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/874d2db4618afc7dc8e153ab0219282147865d4a/remote/remote_state.go.

I believe it's the two files above.

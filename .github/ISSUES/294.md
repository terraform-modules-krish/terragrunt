# output-all fails when one of the modules on the root dir doesn't have outputs

**dmlemos** commented *Sep 17, 2017*

When `terragrunt output-all` runs on a root dir, and one of the sourced modules has no outputs it fails the whole thing.

I propose a config parameter: `--terragrunt-ignore-output-errors` (similar to `--terragrunt-ignore-dependency-errors`)

For now the only workaround was to create a dummy output on the modules that don't have any:
```hcl
output "dummy" {
  value = ""
}
```

Ah, seems like a good addition. PRs welcome!

# if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt" unexpected behavior

**DanielViglione** commented *Apr 4, 2022*

terragrunt version v0.36.0
Terraform v1.1.2
on linux_amd64

I don't see the use case at all for overwrite_terragrunt. Based on the documentation, if the file exists in the sourced terraform repo, then this terragrunt file will overwrite that one. However, given i have a versions.tf in the sourced terraform repo and I include the following in terragrunt.hcl:

```
generate "versions" {
  path      = "versions.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  contents  = <<EOF
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      version = "= 3.74.1"
      source = "hashicorp/aws"
    }
  }
}
EOF
}
```
I get the following error:

`The file path /home/dviglione/projects/cloud-services/scrapetorium-networking/infrastructure/aws-vpc-basic/.terragrunt-cache/1ubCznBzKZfPH82R74f130S9TVs/EQrsx-uVn3BnHHXpIQpiI-_5gmg/aws-vpc-basic/infrastructure/versions.tf already exists and was not generated by terragrunt. 
`
If I try to rename it differently, like to override_versions.tf, then I get another error:

```
 Error: Duplicate required providers configuration
│ 
│   on versions.tf line 2, in terraform:
│    2:   required_providers {
│ 
│ A module may have only one required providers configuration. The required
│ providers were previously configured at override_versions.tf:3,3-21.
```

So no matter what path I give it, it fails with error. So what's the point of this then? This is only useful if the file does not exist in sourced terraform code? Then why have an "overwrite_terragrunt" option if that is the case?

  if_exists = "overwrite"

appears to work

# Terragrunt should check your Terraform code defines a backend

**brikis98** commented *Apr 24, 2017*

A common problem that has been hitting a few Terragrunt users is that they define a `remote_state` block in their Terragrunt configuration, but forget to specify a `backend` in their Terraform configurations (`.tf`). As a result, Terragrunt makes it look like it's configuring your `backend`, but Terraform ignores those configurations completely.

If a `remote_state` block is defined, Terragrunt should do a simple `grep` through the `.tf` source files to look for `backend "XXX"` and make sure that the `XXX` matches the backend `type` specified in `remote_state`. If either check fails, Terragrunt should exit with an error.

On the logs when running Terragrunt you can check if the S3 backend configuration worked properly just to be sure it worked useful while these feature it's implemented.

```
Initializing the backend...


Successfully configured the backend "s3"! Terraform will automatically
use this backend unless the backend configuration changes.

Whoops, looks like I filed the same bug twice. This is a dupe of #212.

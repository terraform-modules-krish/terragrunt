# Make hclfmt format generated code

**alikhil** commented *Apr 14, 2022*

Sometimes we want to generate terraform code and we write configurations like:

```hcl

generate "data" {
  path      = "data_gen.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite"
  contents  = <<EOF
data "yandex_dns_zone" "infra" {
  name = "${local.common.infra_dns_name}"
  folder_id = "${local.common.common_folder_id}"
}
}
```

And if we run `terragrunt hclfmt` and `terraform fmt -recursive` this config will not be formatted. 

However, if we run `terragrunt fmt -check=true` it will produce errors like:

```
data_gen.tf
ERRO[0003] 1 error occurred:
        * exit status 3
```

I propose to add autoformatting of generated objects by setting some special flag (`terragrunt hclfmt --format-generated`)

This is a good point. I think the better approach is for `terragrunt` to format the generated code when it is terraform, e.g. an option on `generate` block:

```
generate "data" {
  # ... other args omitted for brevity ...
  tf_fmt = true
}
```

That way, the code is already formatted when terragrunt emits it out.

# Terragrunt should lock on the remote push command

**brikis98** commented *Sep 16, 2016*

Terraform has a command that syncs the remote state storage with the state stored locally:

```
terraform remote push
```

This obviously updates the remote state, so Terragrunt should obtain a lock before doing it.

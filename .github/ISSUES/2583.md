# terragrunt-tfpath option not working on linux

**bufnitza** commented *May 30, 2023*

I am trying to use terragrunt with terraform (both on latest versions, 0.45.16 and 1.4.6, respectively) within a CI/CD worker context, very standard pattern, no special setup whatsoever.

To do so, I am downloading both binaries to a chrooted environment and chmod-ing them to be executable. Since I cannot put terraform within a PATHed location due to permissions, I am using the terragrunt-tfpath option, as below:

```shell
./terragrunt terragrunt-tfpath=$(pwd)/terraform run-all validate
```

This, however, fails:

```
ERRO[0000] exec: "terraform": executable file not found in $PATH
ERRO[0000] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1
```

But, if I set the `TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH` environment variable, it works:

```shell
export TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH=$(pwd)/terraform
./terragrunt run-all validate
INFO[0000] The stack at /a/8/s will be processed in the following order for command validate:
Group 1
- Module /a/8/s/nonprod


Initializing the backend...
Initializing modules...
...
```

Has the CLI option been deprecated, or is this a subtle bug? I respect that not many people might be using it, so it might be obscured.

One more thing, for what it's worth, the official documentation states that CLI parameters should be prefixed by a double-dash.
https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli-options/#terragrunt-tfpath

However, terragrunt seems to reject this concept:

```shell
./terragrunt --terragrunt-tfpath=$(pwd)/terraform run-all validate
Incorrect Usage. flag provided but not defined: -terragrunt-tfpath

DESCRIPTION:

Nevermind, nothing to see here, just another case of [PEBKAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_error), the options go **after** the command, not before.

Have a good day!

# path_relative_to_include and symlinks

**jbergknoff-rival** commented *Aug 14, 2018*

We have the following kind of setup:

```
dev-account/us-west-2/env-dev/terraform.tfvars
env/dev -> dev-account/us-west-2/env-dev
```

The `env/dev` symlink is just a convenience for manually navigating the directory structure. The terragrunt config specifies a remote state path using `path_relative_to_include()`. This evaluates differently depending on whether you've navigated to the directory directly or via the symlink. Is this desirable behavior, or should the symlink be expanded?

Ah, I don't think we tested those functions with symlinks. My guess is we'd want to expand those paths fully so they are "canonical" paths and always the same. PR for that is welcome.

Note that full symlink support will also depend on https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1611.

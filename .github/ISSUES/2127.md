# terragrunt run-all fmt does not write changes

**crablab** commented *May 30, 2022*

Command: `terragrunt run-all fmt` 

Expected behaviour: Terragrunt runs `terraform fmt` in modules, outputting files that have formatting errors and modifying them to meet the format. In other words, the default behaviour of `fmt`. 

Actual behaviour: `fmt` runs and outputs a list of files that don't meet the standard, but doesn't make changes to these files. Setting `-write=true` makes no difference. 

Is this expected? It's odd to me that the `fmt` behaviour is as expected, except for persisting the formatting corrections to disk.

Hi,
afaik formatting of files is executed on files, maybe occurs an error during processing of files? adding `--terragrunt-log-level debug` to terragrunt may help to show what happens inside

A simplified example for terragrunt that modify files when is invoked `terragrunt run-all fmt`:
https://github.com/denis256/terragrunt-tests/tree/master/issue-2127

```
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean

$ terragrunt run-all fmt
Group 1
- Module /home/denis/projects/gruntwork/terragrunt-tests/issue-2127/module1
- Module /home/denis/projects/gruntwork/terragrunt-tests/issue-2127/module2

Group 2
- Module /home/denis/projects/gruntwork/terragrunt-tests/issue-2127/app
 
main.tf
main.tf
main.tf

$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   app/main.tf
        modified:   module1/main.tf
        modified:   module2/main.tf

```

Apart from the logline
```
DEBU[0004] Running command: terraform fmt 
```
afraid I don't see anything of relevance in the log outputs. 

I can say that it is not modifying any files for certain.

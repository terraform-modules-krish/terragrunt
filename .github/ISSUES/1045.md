# Built-in function to retrieve terragrunt cache directory path?

**sleungcy** commented *Feb 13, 2020*

I am working on a project that can potentially have 100+ terragrunt modules.

I am looking into a way to modify or add to the terraform cached files before terraform plan, such that I can dry up the boilerplate that is in every module.

```
  before_hook "plan" {
    commands = ["plan"]
    execute  = ["/bin/bash", "${local.tg_hcls_root}/scripts/copy_common_tf.sh", local.tg_hcls_root, "."]
  }
```

Above is my first attempt, but I would prefer to have a more specfic "get-terragrunt-cache-dir" built-in function instead of using ".", what do you think?

This is one of the solutions to address https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/749, and has been generally considered as a usable function.

However, note that the implementation is non-trivial (I had attempted to implement it once) as you don't know the terragrunt cache directory unless you know the terraform module path, which means you need to:

- Do a partial parsing of the config to extract the terraform source.
- Compute the terragrunt cache dir, refactoring the code to ensure the same routine is used both within the helper and in terragrunt runtime; something that is annoying due to all the private functions and package organization for this routine.

FYI as mentioned in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/749#issuecomment-586051840, https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1050 might be an alternative.

Looking for this also. In terragrunt <= 0.18, when the hooks ran in the cache directory, we could specify commands to run against files _in the remote source_ using a local/relative path. I.e. terragrunt would retrieve the remote source, change into the cache directory, and run hooks. So we could specify something like, `pip install requirements.txt && python render.py`, where both requirements.txt and render.py were maintained in the remote module. That no longer works, because as mentioned in #749 the hooks no longer operate out of the cache directory.

# Get the generated path for terraform block in terragrunt.hcl

**cedsana** commented *Mar 28, 2022*

I would like to be able to version my special Terragrunt files. More precisely, the one generating the `provider.tf`.

After careful thinking, I decided it would make the most sense for all my source Terraform folders to be bundled with their `make_provider.hcl` file when I `git tag` them.  
By doing this, I can bump the aws provider version for my project `project-v05` and reverting to `project-v04` would still work as it did before. Moreover, I don't have to bump the provider version everywhere at once.

To achieve this, I thought of two possible solutions:
- Including a `terragrunt.hcl` from a github repository instead of including it from my local project.
- Being able to "find" the directory in which Terragrunt cloned my `terraform` block in order to execute a `find_in_parent_folders("make_provider.hcl")` starting from this directory.

From what I could find on the internet, there is no way to achieve what I want to do for now.  
The second option seems to be the easiest one. I could do something like `terraform.my_project.output_dir`, for example.

Hi,
not sure if this is supported now, however, I think can be used `include` block and git submodules to reference `make_provider*` files from other repositories.

Hi and thanks for answering!

Something like the following should work?  

```
include "provider" {
  path           = "git::git@github.com:orga/repo.git//path/to/make_provider.hcl?ref=provider-v03"
}
```

I didn't see any example so I didn't thing it was legal.

Hi,
I was thinking about a setup like:

```
include "provider" {
  path = "../configs/make_provider.hcl"
}
```

Where `../configs` is a git submodule referencing a specific tag/branch

Simplified example:

Ok thanks, I see what you mean but using git submodules is not really something I can do.

I hoped for a solution from the Terragrunt side of things.

Is there any best practice about a way to better tie generator Terragrunt files and Terraform sources together? Updating a generator Terragrunt file retroactively breaks all my Terraform sources, it's a bit dangerous.

By the way, I think this would be a requirement for proper immutability when using Terragrunt with `generate` blocks.  
For now, there is no way to guarantee immutability if Terraform files are generated since we can't freeze an included Terragrunt file.

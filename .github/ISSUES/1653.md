# Lock file handling strategy is not best practice?

**james-skinner-deltatre** commented *Apr 23, 2021*

I am looking at adopting `terragrunt` into our workflow. Everything looks good to me so far except [the advice and behaviour around handling `.terraform.lock.hcl`](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/lock-file-handling/) files does not seem right.

I have read over the related issue #1498 and I think [this comment](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1498#issuecomment-768211313) hits the nail on the head.

The lock file exists so that I can pull down dependencies for a specific version of my codebase in a repeatable way. So that means when I have my_module@v1.0.0 and run `terraform init` I get the same provider versions, whether I am running tests, deploying to dev or stage or prod etc.

This means **the lock file belongs with the module code** - i.e. versioned alongside the provider constraints and the rest of the code.

The [terragrunt docs](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/lock-file-handling/) on the other hand, imply the lock file should live with the environment configuration. If you do this then:
* yes, each time you apply the same release version to the same environment, you run with the same provider versions as last time. I can see a benefit there.
* However, when you update or add a new provider into the module, as you role that new module version out, each environment you deploy to could get a different version of that provider. This is exactly what the lock file is there to help avoid.

From what I can see, in the scenario where the lock file lives in the module code, `terragrunt` **does** respect the `.terraform.lock.hcl` file rather than overwriting it, which is great. However I think the following changes would be positive:

1. The docs should advise to keep the lock file with the module code as best practice and only use the functionality to copy the lock file between cache and working directory when that is not an option.
2. If a referenced module already contains a `.terraform.lock.hcl` file alongside the code, the copying functionality should be disabled

...or maybe I am missing something here?

Thanks for raising this discussion!

I suspect that different users will want to handle lock files differently:

1. Some will want it to be handled with the module, so that everywhere the module is used, you get the exact same provider versions. This has the advantage of using the same provider versions you tested the module with everywhere you deploy the module.
2. Others will want it to be handled with the live environments, so that each environment is pinned to specific versions. This has the advantage of allowing different environments/teams/use cases to use different provider versions. 

I suspect (1) is the best practice for _most_, so I'd be in favor of this update:

> 1. The docs should advise to keep the lock file with the module code as best practice and only use the functionality to copy the lock file between cache and working directory when that is not an option.

On the other hand, this change might interfere with (2):

> 2. If a referenced module already contains a `.terraform.lock.hcl` file alongside the code, the copying functionality should be disabled

Perhaps this is one place where we add a flag that skips the lock file copying functionality. Or, vice versa, enables the copying functionality, with the default being off.

That sounds like the right solution. My concern would be what the default is - at the moment I suspect somebody who isn't giving much thought to this will read the docs (or not) and end up with scenario 2 when they almost certainly would be better off with scenario 1.

To be honest I don't see much of a use case for scenario 2 but maybe I can't see past my own experience here. Where I have used lock files in the past, it is analogous with scenario 1. For example:
* A node.js **application**, which you write and deploy to various environments, **will have a lock file checked into version control**
* A **module** (as in `npm` module) for that application will specifically **not** have a lock file bundled with it.

Drawing parallels with this in the context of terraform:
* a `terraform` codebase referenced by `terragrunt` config (lets say it provisions a microservice, a database, some other related resources) is akin to the node.js _application_. I would call this a "component".
* a `terraform` module used by this component and potentially others (e.g. provisioning just the database) is akin to the `npm` module. 

...but maybe not every use case is as simplistic as this. Or for some others the `terragrunt` config functions as the "component"

I think the key use case you're missing is that people often use Terragrunt to _generate_ code. This includes generating `provider` blocks, `backend` blocks, and sometimes resources, data sources, and `module` blocks. In these scenario, a checked-in lock file doesn't help, as it doesn't have all the info. So there, you'd have to keep the lock file with the `terragrunt.hcl`.

It's worth mentioning that in most programming environments, including Node.js, there are actually _multiple_ lock files. E.g., The open source project express.js has its own lock file; and my project, which depends on `express.js` has its own lock file too. I don't know if Terraform properly handles this multi-layer lock file approach...

yep, you're right. I guess a rule of thumb is the lock file lives with the provider version constraints definition - i.e. the `required_providers` block

Not sure its worth debating here but not sure you are right about the multi-layer lock files, at least in the `npm` case. In fact [it is not possible to publish the standard lock file in an `npm` module](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json#files). There is [a different lock file](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/npm-shrinkwrap-json) which you _can_ publish but this is only for special cases.

Both modules and applications will have `package.json` files but this only covering version contraints, so equivalent to the `required_providers` block

I agree with @james-skinner-deltatre here, it really seems appropriate to version terraform lockfiles within the underlying modules instead of within the live repository that contains the `terragrunt.hcl` file.  It seems odd that both the module and the "live" environments need to be concerned with terraform provider versions:

- modules need to specify `terraform.required_providers`
- live environment needs to specify a `.terraform.lock.hcl` alongside the `terragrunt.hcl` configuration.

It would be much easier if the live environment only had to be concerned with the version of the terraform module that's being ran, that's it.  Then, the module could handle all of the required terraform providers and their exact versions.

I like @brikis98's suggestion of adding a flag to skip the lockfile copying functionality, or perhaps adding it as a configuration attribute within the `terragrunt.hcl`, similar to the `iam_role` attribute.

I'd be happy to open a PR with this functionality if it would be welcomed.

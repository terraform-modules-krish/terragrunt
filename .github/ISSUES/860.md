# Setting to apply external dependencies in Non-interactive mode

**gcrespi** commented *Sep 10, 2019*

Today's behaviour defaults to not applying external dependencies in non-interactive mode as we can see in [these lines of code](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/8fa2f715589fcba6c6e0131e4d954b9b4264463d/configstack/module.go#L436).
I would like to have some configuration (for example a cli option) to apply the external dependencies even though the non-interactive mode has been set on.

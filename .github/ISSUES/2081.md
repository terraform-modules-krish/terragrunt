# Destroy terragrunt configuration without the dependencies

**alexgr-tr** commented *Apr 24, 2022*

Hi,
We are trying to have the destroy ability inside our CI/CD pipelines.
We create a plan file using terragrunt run-all plan -destroy -out ...
After the plan is reviewed and acknowledged, we run terragrunt apply with the plan file from the plan step.
The problem that we are facing is in a situation when we have dependencies, and we don't want to destroy them.

We can't use the  --terragrunt-ignore-external-dependencies flag because we need the output data from the dependencies output. We can not use the include flag because the plan of the destroy shows us that it will destroy the dependencies.

We also worked with the mock options on init and validate flags.

Maybe some have an idea how we can overcome this issue?

Hi,
was considered to pass `--terragrunt-exclude-dir <path to module to igonre>` to not generate/execute plan for not required modules? 

Like:
``` 
terragrunt run-all plan -destroy -out plan.out -terragrunt-exclude-dir $(pwd)/module-to-not-destroy
terragrunt  run-all  apply plan.out --terragrunt-exclude-dir $(pwd)/module-to-not-destroy
```

# apply-all does not set auto-approve parameter

**dewang** commented *Dec 1, 2017*

As of Terraform v0.11, the default behaviour for `terraform apply` is to show the plan and wait for approval. When using `apply-all` this results in the script waiting for input for every module that you want to deploy.

Well, `apply-all` just runs `apply` in every directory, so it inherits whatever behavior Terraform has for `apply`. If you want it to be fully non-interactive, can't you just run `terragrunt apply-all -auto-approve`?

Interesting, I didn't think the parameter would be passed through. The stack sets `-input=false` https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/bc8bae6f1c771f5a5a38953a4bc041521c984940/configstack/stack.go#L73 so I assumed the `-auto-approve` would have to be passed the same way.
I can't imagine that anyone using `apply-all` would _not_ want it to be fully non-interactive.

Having said all that, I have to say a massive thanks for terragrunt and also your blog posts. They've really helped me get set up with terraform.

I believe the `setTerraformCommand` method [appends your CLI args to the passed-in command](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/bc8bae6f1c771f5a5a38953a4bc041521c984940/configstack/stack.go#L114-L118), so it *should* work. Try it out and let me know!

Thanks :)

Just faced the same problem and tested vanilla terraform option `-auto-approve` : it does work 👍 

That being said it really make the `--terragrunt-non-interactive` flag confusing since terraform v0.11.

Shouldn't the `-auto-approve` as well as `-force` options be added as well when using `--terragrung-non-interactive` ?

I could go either way on this one, but *probably* setting `-auto-approve` to `true` would be following "principle of least surprise."

What is `-force`?

**ebarault** commented *Dec 5, 2017*

`-force`: [cli option for **destroy**](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/destroy.html)

"If -force is set, then the destroy confirmation will not be shown"

Ah, I see. Give how destructive `destroy` is, I'd rather NOT include `-force`. It may be a mild annoyance for users, but easily solved by adding that parameter in; the opposite situation, where you didn't realize `-force` would be included automatically would be much worse!

Another vote for adding `-auto-approve` when using `apply-all`. Without it, you end up with the terraform prompts getting lost when terragrunt runs multiple instances in parallel. It really makes no sense not to have `-auto-approve` with `apply-all` even when not using `--terragrunt-non-interactive`

Ah, yea, that's a good point. 

I'd welcome a PR to add this.

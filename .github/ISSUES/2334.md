# Remote GSC support to GOOGLE_BACKEND_CREDENTIALS

**alexbacchin-asx** commented *Oct 24, 2022*

I want to propose we align with[ terraform on credentials to access GCS buckets](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/gcs#configuration-variables). 

At the moment, terragrunt does not support GOOGLE_BACKEND_CREDENTIALS therefore we have to maintain provide GSC permissions to 2 different principals. I understand this is a not a common case, but it will be great to have this alignment. I am happy to work on this

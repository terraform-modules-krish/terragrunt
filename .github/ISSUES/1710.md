Was the required ver not bumped in the build? Or did this ticket get closed even though TF 1.0 support is still only in "test" mode currently?

```
$ terragrunt --version
terragrunt version v0.31.0

$ terraform --version
Terraform v1.0.0
on darwin_amd64

$ terragrunt plan
ERRO[0002] The currently installed version of Terraform (1.0.0) is not compatible with the version Terragrunt requires (~> 0.14). 
```

@jmooo Check your config to see if you have any custom [terraform_version_constraints](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#terraform_version_constraint) defined.

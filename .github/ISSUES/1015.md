# hclfmt should exit 1 when reformatting a file

To be consistent with `terraform fmt` and easier to use in a script, the `hclfmt` command should exit 1 when it fixes the format of a file.

OK so it needs the `--terragrunt-check` option to be passed but this option is not documented [here](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/getting-started/cli-options/#cli-options)

Will add this in the reference update I am working on now: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1009

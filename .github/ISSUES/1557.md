# backend s3 config: error within if condition - 'encrypt' expected type 'bool', got unconvertible type 'string'

**cfir-atbay** commented *Feb 21, 2021*

I'm trying to define a config block for two environments - local and cloud and I'm using the if/else condition but I got an error message for the encrypt attribute of the s3 bucket: 'encrypt' expected type 'bool', got unconvertible type 'string'. If I remove the if/else condition block then it worked but I need to choose between the two environments, so I've to use if/else condition. The config block code:

`
config = local.is_local_environment ? {
    # Local configuration
    path = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
  } : {
    # Cloud configuration
    bucket = "my-bucket"
    key = "terraform/${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
    region = local.region
    encrypt = true
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-lock"
  }
}
`

Could you update your post to use a [fenced code block](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks) and proper indentation so it's easier to read?

Also, could you share the full log output, including the command you ran?

local backends don't expect any kind of config. Just use `null`

```hcl
config = local.is_local_environment ? null : { 
  # Cloud configuration 
  bucket = "my-bucket" 
  key = "terraform/${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate" 
  region = local.region 
  encrypt = true 
  dynamodb_table = "terraform-lock" 
} 
}
```

@brikis98 I think you can close this issue, @john-delivuk has provided a solution / workaround.

@brikis98 I think the issue still persists. Reproducer:

`terragrunt.hcl`:
```
remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  config = true ? {
    bucket = "terraform-state-test"
    key = "test"
    region = "us-east-1"
    encrypt = true
  } : {}
}
```

`main.tf`:
```
terraform {
  backend "s3" {}
}
```

Does not look like a Terragrunt issue per se though.

It works fine as long as the config map contains the same type of objects.

Even though terraform ignores path in local configs, it is still a [documented parameter](
https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/local#configuration-variables)

In my case, I'm using it to check that the state key won't collide when doing local plans.
```
  config = local.is_atlantis ? {
    region         = "us-east-1"
    bucket         = "xxxx"
    dynamodb_table = "xxxx"
    key            = "${local.service_state_key}/terraform.tfstate"
    encrypt        = true
    } : {
    path = "${local.service_state_key}/terraform.tfstate"
  }
```

It would be nice to add support for this.

workaround

```
locals {
  ....
  remote_backend = local.use_local ? "local" : "s3"
  remote_state_config = {
    s3 = {
      region         = "us-east-1"
      bucket         = "xxxxx"
      dynamodb_table = "xxxx"
      key            = "${local.service_state_key}/terraform.tfstate"
      encrypt        = true
    }
    local = {
      path = "${local.service_state_key}/terraform.tfstate"
    }
  } 
}

remote_state {
  backend = local.remote_backend
  config  = local.remote_state_config[local.remote_backend]
  generate = {
    path      = "~backend.tf"
    if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  }
}
```

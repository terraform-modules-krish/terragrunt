# Terragrunt fails with "fatal: unsafe repository" (security issue CVE-2022-24765)

**Halytskyi** commented *Apr 13, 2022*

Yesterday was announced [Git security vulnerability announced](https://github.blog/2022-04-12-git-security-vulnerability-announced/) and as result this fix was released to git versions: v2.30.3, v2.31.2, v2.32.1, v2.33.2, v2.34.2 and v2.35.2 which is in all Alpine repos now.

I use Alpine docker image for testing terragrunt/terraform code before merging it to repo. Also, during running terragrant downloading all necessary modules which located in different git repo. This docker container running on Jenkins host and mounting workspace directory (with git code) inside container for running terragrunt commands to test code inside container. As this workspace directory has different owner ID with user inside container I faced with issue:

```bash
bash-5.1$ terragrunt validate-inputs
[INFO] Getting version from tgenv-version-name
[INFO] TGENV_VERSION is 0.36.6
ERRO[0008] 1 error occurred:
	* error downloading 'ssh://git@mydomain.com/myorg/infrastructure-terraform-modules.git?ref=0.0.9': /usr/bin/git exited with 128: fatal: unsafe repository ('/opt/repo/dev/tools/vault/.terragrunt-cache/dxgrCjJ0askDUIWmsSDke-WFKo/VwXS3fdhvcR-YxgOUFDj3Sujd3GgE' is owned by someone else)
To add an exception for this directory, call:

	git config --global --add safe.directory /opt/repo/dev/tools/vault/.terragrunt-cache/dxgrCjJ0askDUIWmsSDke-WFKo/VwXS3fdhvcR-YxgOUFDj3Sujd3GgE


ERRO[0008] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1
```

And sure, I can't apply this git command before running terragrunt as I don't know which dir name will be under ".terragrunt-cache" dir.

One of the ways to solve this issue - is use the same UID inside container as it used for owner of workspace directory on host node.
The 2nd way is clone terragrunt git repo inside container.
But, as for me, both these solutions not so good and not correct for some specific cases.

Is any other solutions can be used here to solve this issue? For example, some specific configuration for running terragrunt with some params for git command which can ignore this ownership issue?

One possible workaround: could you work around this by pointing [TERRAGRUNT_DOWNLOAD](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli-options/#terragrunt-download-dir) to a directory that the UID owns?

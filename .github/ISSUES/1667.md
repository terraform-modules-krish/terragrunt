# ERRO[0009] Did not find any Terraform files (*.tf)

**s1mark** commented *May 5, 2021*

### Scenario
* Creating the `.tf` files in the `.terragrunt-cache`  with the `generate` block
* The source is pointing to the `directory` where the `terragrunt.hcl` file exists:
```terraform
terraform {
  source = "..//directory"
}
```
### Result
`ERRO[0009] Did not find any Terraform files (*.tf)`

### Workaround
Create an empty file that ends with `.tf` in the current `directory`

### Request
Would it be possible to overcome `ERRO[0009] Did not find any Terraform files (*.tf)` somehow without the need to create a `dummy.tf` file? terragrunt really just copies the `dummy.tf` to the cache and successfully executes the generated `.tf` files.
Is it possible to ignore `ERRO[0009]` ?

I'm a bit confused by this... `source` should be pointing to a folder with _Terraform_ code (`*.tf`), not _Terragrunt_ code (e.g., `terragrunt.hcl`). Could you describe your use cases / context a bit more?

@brikis98 thanks for reaching out!
The idea was that the `terragrun.hcl` would generate the `terraform` code and specify that as the source 
Can we point somehow the source to the cache where we generate the `terraform` code?

I'm still not entirely clear on what you're trying to do. Could you provide a bit more context?

I THINK I follow what you are trying to do, and I believe this would work if you:

- remove the `terraform` block so that it uses the current dir (where the `terragrunt.hcl` file lives) as the tf source.
- add an empty `main.tf` file with a single comment (`# Intentionally empty`).

Closing this as I believe that will achieve what you want. Happy to reopen if there are any follow ups, or if somehow that doesn't work.

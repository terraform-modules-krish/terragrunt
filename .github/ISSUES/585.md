# terraform question output is hidden until after question is answered

**grimm26** commented *Oct 11, 2018*

starting with terragrunt 0.17.0 I hit this bug where when terraform asks a question, like confirming an apply, you can't see the question until after you have answered it.  It looks like it has stalled, but it is really just waiting for you to answer a question.

I've also been seeing this...

Hm, this may be related to the recent stdout/stderr changes from #583... I'm not going to be able to look at this for a few days, but if anyone has a few minutes, this method would probably be my starting point: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/shell/run_shell_cmd.go#L184

I'll take a look.

The problem is indeed in the `readStdoutAndStderr`. The `bufio.Scanner` default split function (`ScanLines`) scans line by line and we get a newline only after the user answers the `Enter a value:` prompt. We have a couple of options: 

1. Change the split function to `ScanBytes`
2. Use `io.MultiWriter` and `io.Copy` like here: https://github.com/kjk/go-cookbook/blob/master/advanced-exec/03-live-progress-and-capture-v3.go

Based on a quick test both seem to work. I'm leaning towards option 1 as it involves making only minor modifications. 

Don't know if it's a valid concern, but with the byte (instead of lines) scanning and concurrent stdout/err writes, could the captured output be corrupt?

@autero1 A big thank you for looking into this!

Oh, man, nice find. This definitely looks like the right approach to use for what we're doing. How big of a change would it be?

Yea, I worry it would be. If you read some random number of bytes, you might parse half a word or even half a letter, which would lead to very messy output.

Not a very big change. Already tested with a quick-and-dirty copy-paste that it works. However, not really sure it would solve the byte reading problem.

In the end I wasn't able to find a reason why using the io.Copy was necessary. Ended up removing a lot of code in favor of the MultiWriter.

Should be fixed in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.17.1. Thank you @autero1!

# Allow running hclfmt on a single file

**yorinasub17** commented *Mar 13, 2020*

Right now, if you are trying to format a single hcl file, you will end up formatting the entire tree including subdirectories. There should be a CLI option `--terragrunt-hclfmt-file` which when provided, will only run hclfmt on that file.

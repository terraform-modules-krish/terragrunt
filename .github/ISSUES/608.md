# Tags not being applied to state bucket or dynamodb

**flmmartins** commented *Nov 20, 2018*

So... I've been using terragrunt successfully so far but the tagging during the creation of the S3 bucket or Dynamo DB does not work. I am passing them with s3_bucket_tags and dynamodb_table_tags but nothing is happening:

```
terragrunt = {
  remote_state {
      backend = "s3"
      config {
        bucket = "xxxx"
        key = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
        region = "xxx"
        encrypt = true
        dynamodb_table = "xxxx"

        s3_bucket_tags {
          name = "Terraform State File"
          environment = "demo"
        }

        dynamodb_table_tags {
          name  = "Terraform Lock Table"
          environment = "demo"
        }
      }
  }

```

Best,

Are you using those with a bucket / table that already exist? It might only tag them when creating totally new ones... Also, which version of Terragrunt are you using?
***

**flmmartins** commented *Nov 21, 2018*

I created from scratch.

Version v0.17.2

**brikis98** commented *Nov 21, 2018*

Could you share the full log output from running Terragrunt when creating the bucket/table? It may give a hint as to what's happening.

@flmmartins, @brikis98  Well same thing :( version `v0.17.1`

@brikis98 Sorry for the confusion :)
@flmmartins Works, as it occurs to check the encryption we have to check the properties of the actual `*.tfstate` file. And yes it's in the place.

Hi Denny,

I still have the problem where despite putting on code my buckets are neither encrypted or tagged.
Can you elaborate on how you solve your problem? Did you do it manually and then terragrunt pick it up or what?

@brikis98 I still haven't had the opportunity to reproduce this and fetch the logs.... but I know it's still happening because I create from scratch again since them but I had to do it in a hurry

**dennybaa** commented *Jan 17, 2019*

Hey @flmmartins ,
yes it works. `terragrunt apply` then find your tfstate file and check the properties: ![](http://pix.toile-libre.org/upload/original/1547745582.png)

terragrunt: v0.17.1
terraform: v0.11.10
***

**flmmartins** commented *Jan 18, 2019*

@dennybaa I thought you've done something to achieve this....

I notice we have different versions though. I'm using:

Terragrunt version v0.17.2
Terraform v0.11.10
***

**flmmartins** commented *Feb 6, 2019*

I double check again and the terraform.tfvars is encrypted!! I was looking in AWS bucket properties (ENTER BUCKET > PROPERTIES > check the AWS encryption tile) and it says it's no encrypted but if you go to terraform.tfvars object properties as you posted @dennybaa is encrypted. AWS will make me crazy :P 

Unfortunately the **tagging** is still not being applied @brikis98 

I had to update my versions. So now I'm running in 

terragrunt version v0.17.4
Terraform v0.11.11

I just created a new bucket and dynamodb with tagging. The logs is bellow:

@flmmartins I ran into the same problem earlier today. My tags wouldn't be applied to the DynamoDB and S3, even when created from scratch.

What solved the issue for me was to delete the `.terragrunt-cache` subdirectories which had existed before I added the tagging configurations to the terragrunt block. It seems that these configuration changes are ignored when the cache already exists.

Possibly a bug?

Humm I don't remember if I had cached terragrunt folder at the time...
When I have the opportunity to create another state I will post info here

**flmmartins** commented *May 21, 2019*

Okey.. I tested this and I had no caching I and the tagging worked but I upgraded my version to v0.18.3 last week... I wonder if the version had anything to do it with...
***

**flmmartins** commented *Jun 25, 2019*

Well.. I created yet another state and everythings is fine with version 18.3. If anyone has further issues can reopen this. =)

I just ran into this problem, clearing all the `.terragrunt-cache` folders worked for me 👍 Thanks @ssklee

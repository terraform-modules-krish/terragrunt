# Disable -var and -var-file flags when running terragrunt destroy with a plan file

**FineWolf** commented *Apr 21, 2020*

This is a mirror of issue #493 that was never corrected for `destroy`.

When running `terragrunt destroy` with a plan file, terragrunt mistakenly includes `-var` and `-var-file` when delegating back to terraform. The execution plan then fails with the following error:

```
You can't set variables with the '-var' or '-var-file' flag
when you're applying a plan file. The variables used when
the plan was created will be used. If you wish to use different
variable values, create a new plan file.
```

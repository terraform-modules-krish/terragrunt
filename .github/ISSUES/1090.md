# Docs on website use low contrast navigation

**rdonkin** commented *Mar 13, 2020*

The docs website is very nice and I'm sure a lot of effort went into this.

One thing that should be improved is the low contrast navigation on the left - this is quite illegible making the site much harder to use.

In this screenshot, note how the main doc text on right is easily readable while the text in navigation is not:

Some reasons why low-contrast text is a problem for usability as well as accessibility:   https://www.nngroup.com/articles/low-contrast/

Good point! Would you be up for a PR to fix this?

I'm not a web developer so won't be doing a PR, but a simple adjustment of this light grey to darker grey may be enough.

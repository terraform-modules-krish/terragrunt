# Migrate to terraform 0.12.4 user_data hash issue

**natarov** commented *Jul 16, 2019*

**Issue:**
After migration to terraform 0.12.4, terragrunt 0.19.8 and aws provider 2.19.0 I've got an issue with user_data hash, it's going to recreate instances as user_data hash has been changed, if I put user_data to lifecycle ignore_changes issue has gone. The issue doesn't relate with aws provider as on terraform 0.11.14, terragrunt 0.18.3 and aws provider 2.19.0 (the same which I use with 12 terraform) I don't have this issue

Hi @natarov,

This sounds like it might be a Terraform core or AWS Provider issue rather than a Terragrunt issue. Are you able to do an isolated test with Terraform directly to figure out if the same thing happens with Terragrunt out of the equation?

Yes, using terraform directly I've received the same result

Hi @natarov, please open this against [the AWS provider repo](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/issues), providing a minimal example using terraform. The provider has 2 completely different code paths between Tf12 and Tf11 even if you are using the same version, so it could still be a bug in the provider.

I am going to close this since this is not an issue with terragrunt.

# terragrunt logs get buffered until after plan completes, but only during `run-all plan`

**tjstansell** commented *Feb 1, 2023*

I'm running into an issue where running a `terragrunt run-all plan` in one of our repos does not produce the right kind of log output.  This does NOT happen with `run-all init` or even `run-all apply` -- those seem to log properly. 

```
root@eccd78ffe8a2:/app/deployments/saws2-dev/us-west-2# terragrunt run-all plan
INFO[0003] The stack at /app/deployments/saws2-dev/us-west-2 will be processed in the following order for command plan:

```

Notice how all of the `level=warning` and `level=info` messages from terragrunt are bundled together as a single `INFO[0011]` line _after_ the plan is completed.  This only appears to happen during `run-all plan`.  If I use `plan` directly, it shows the correct output of these logs as they are generated ...

To show this point even more, if I increase the terragrunt logging to debug level, even those get buffered.

```
Again, notice how it ends with a single `INFO[0007]` line that's a concatenation of all other logs that had been generated up to then.  I don't believe we are doing anything special here that could be affecting this. 

I'm running terragrunt `v0.43.1`.

I have determined this only happens when using a `terraform { source = ... }` definition within terragrunt.  I played around and ended up with the simplest test case I can find:
```
$ tree
.
├── foo.tf
├── stack
│   └── main.tf
└── terragrunt.hcl
$ cat foo.tf
resource "random_pet" "that" {}
$ cat stack/main.tf
resource "random_pet" "this" {}
$ cat terragrunt.hcl
terraform {
  source = "./stack"

  # so our terragrunt logging shows more progress
  before_hook "starting" {
    commands = ["init", "plan", "apply"]
    execute  = ["true"]
  }

  after_hook "complete" {
    commands     = ["init", "plan", "apply"]
    execute      = ["true"]
    run_on_error = true
  }
}
```
If you run `terragrunt run-all init`, then `plan`, then `apply`, you'll see that plan's logs are messed up.  If you start over again with `source` line commented out, the output also looks correct.

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

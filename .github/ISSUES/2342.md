# HCL to json

**kamilpi** commented *Oct 31, 2022*

Hi,

I would like to have a JSON format of my terragrunt.hcl file for third-party application. Actually I need to read specific sections like '''inputs'' and some analysis and other stuff that are out of the terragrunt functionality.

Do you have some idea about this?
If I have a JSON structure I will be able to do this and also open gate will be ready for some new tools.

Hi,
was considered to `terragrunt render-json`?

```
$ terragrunt render-json 
$ cat terragrunt_rendered.json | jq .inputs
{
  "in_list": [
    "abc",
    "123",
    "000"
  ]
}

```

Yes, this is a good point but I would like to find dependency variables inside submodules so that when I execute render-json it will be rendered and I will not be able to track variables assigned inside.
```
inputs = {
  globals            = dependency.labels.outputs.globals
...
}
```

Actually, I found a solution to this issue.
I used @denis256 solution with `terragrunt render-json` but also a simple HCL parser in python to receive rendered and non-rendered content. Thanks to this I will be able to generate dependency of variables.

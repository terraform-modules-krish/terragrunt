# Refreshing State

**EdisonHarada** commented *Dec 8, 2018*

Hi,
I have an issue here, but I'm not sure if is really a bug or not.
I was running the "terragrunt apply", and by mistake I closed the terminal file, so it created half of the command.
After I removed the lock from the state file, and when I tried to run "terragrunt destroy" it said that I didn't have anything to delete. So I ran "terragrunt refresh" and I receive this warning from terraform:

```
Edisons-MacBook-Pro:test-02 edisonharada$ terragrunt refresh

_Empty or non-existent state file.

Refresh will do nothing. Refresh does not error or return an erroneous
exit status because many automation scripts use refresh, plan, then apply
and may not have a state file yet for the first run._

```

After the refresh the state file didn't change, so if I try to apply or destroy I'll get an error.

My project structure is:
```
InfraCode
terraform.tfvars - configuring the state lock
    - artifacts
        terraform.tfvars
    - app
    application.tfvars - added in the root terraform.tfvars as "optional_var_files", and just have a few variables
        - test-02
        terraform.tfvars - call modules from git, passing parameters and everything

```
Should I configure something specific to run terragrunt refresh?
The error from terraform makes sense, since I don't have the file locally, but it's pointing to the application.tfvars I don't know if it should point to the terraform.tfvars in the root folder.



Now basically I'm going to delete everything manually to after try to apply the changes again


Here's the code.

InfraCode/terraform.tfvars
```
terragrunt = {
  remote_state {
    backend = "s3"

    config {
      bucket         = "bucket-name"
      key            = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
      region         = "eu-central-1"
      encrypt        = true
      dynamodb_table = "terraform-lock-state"

      s3_bucket_tags {
        owner = "terragrunt integration test"
        name  = "Terraform state storage"
      }

      dynamodb_table_tags {
        owner = "terragrunt integration test"
        name  = "Terraform lock table"
      }
    }
  }

  terraform {
    extra_arguments "bucket" {
      commands = [
        "${get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars()}"
      ]
      optional_var_files = [
          "${get_tfvars_dir()}/${find_in_parent_folders("application.tfvars", "ignore")}",
          "${get_tfvars_dir()}/${find_in_parent_folders("environment.tfvars", "ignore")}"
      ]
    }

    extra_arguments "retry_lock" {
      commands = [
        "plan",
        "apply",
        "destroy",
        "refresh"
      ]

      arguments = [
        "-lock-timeout=20m"
      ]
    }
  }
}

is_windows = 0
```

InfraCode/app/application.tfvars
```
terragrunt = {
  dependencies {
    paths = ["../artifacts"]
  }
}

service_name = "app"
```

InfraCode/app/test-02/terraform.tfvars
```
terragrunt = {
  terraform {
    source = "gitlink"
  }

  include = {
    path = "${find_in_parent_folders()}"
  }
}

more variables...
```

I'm not sure this has anything to do with Terragrunt. If you shut down the Terraform process part-way through a run, it won't be able to record what it did in `terraform.tfstate`, so your state file will be incomplete or empty. There's nothing Terragrunt can do about that; you'll most likely have to find the resources manually and either delete them by hand or use the `import` command to pull them into your state file.

Closing as stale and since it looks like the original question has been answered. Please open a new issue if there is any follow up. Thanks!

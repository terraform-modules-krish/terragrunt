# Invalid escape sequence; The symbol "S" is not a valid escape sequence selector.

This is my code snippet from an ECS Container definition:

```
      logConfiguration = {
        logDriver = "awslogs",
        options = {
          awslogs-group         = "/${local.account_name}/ecs/${local.service_name}"
          awslogs-region        = local.aws_region
          awslogs-stream-prefix = "ecs"
          awslogs-create-group  = "true"
          awslogs-multiline-pattern = "^\S"
        }
      }
```
`awslogs-multiline-pattern` is expecting a regex, and my regex is `^\S`.

My plan is failing with error: `Invalid escape sequence; The symbol "S" is not a valid escape sequence selector.`

Is there a way to escape that `\S` correctly?

Try `"^\\S"`, it seems to be treating that \ as the beginning of an escape sequence. See this issue for a better description of why from Terraform: [Terraform Issue 23007](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23007)

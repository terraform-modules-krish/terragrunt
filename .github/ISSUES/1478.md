# Terragrunt runtime exception

Terraform version: 0.14.3
Terragrunt version: 0.26.7
OS: Windows 10 Pro 64bit

Hello,

I am experiencing a weird Terragrunt runtime error. I've tested this on two different machines. My desktop PC is working fine but I am getting an exception when I run terragrunt on my laptop. I've pasted a snippet of the exception below. Just wondering if anyone has encountered this before?

Both my desktop and laptop are on Windows 10 Pro 64 bit.

```
C:\terragrunt>terragrunt.exe
Exception 0xc0000005 0x0 0x7ffe0e650fff 0x285c0000

This looks like the binary is for the wrong architecture/OS. Can you try downloading from the following link and try again? https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/download/v0.26.7/terragrunt_windows_amd64.exe

If it still fails, then the build process must have failed and I will investigate further.

I've just downloaded it again from that link and it works on my laptop now.

Thanks!

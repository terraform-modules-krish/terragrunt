# Unable to read / parse file with variables

**pkaramol** commented *Oct 6, 2019*

Here is my modules and live directories' structure:

[![enter image description here][1]][1]

In my `terragrunt/aws-vpc/variables.tf`, there is the following declaration:

```
variable "remote_state_bucket" {
  description = "The bucket containing the terraform remote state"
}
```

However, when trying to perform a `terragrunt apply` in the live directory, i get the following:


```
var.remote_state_bucket
  The bucket containing the terraform remote state

  Enter a value:
```

Here is my `terraform-live/environments/staging/terragrunt.hcl`

```
  remote_state {
    backend = "s3"
    config = {
      bucket  = "my-bucket-staging"
      key  = "terraform/state/var.env_name/${path_relative_to_include()}"
      region = "eu-west-1"
    }
  }
  # Configure root level variables that all resources can inherit
  terraform {
    extra_arguments "extra_args" {
      commands = "${get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars()}"
      optional_var_files = [
          "${get_terragrunt_dir()}/${find_in_parent_folders("config.tfvars", "ignore")}",
          "${get_terragrunt_dir()}/${find_in_parent_folders("secrets.auto.tfvars", "ignore")}",
      ]
    }
  }
``` 

What is more, the variable seems to be declared in one of the files that `terragrunt` is instructed to read variables from:


```
➢  cat terraform-live/environments/staging/config.tfvars
remote_state_bucket = "pkaramol-staging"
```

Why is `terragrunt` (or `terraform` ?) unable to read the specific variable?

```
➢  terragrunt --version
terragrunt version v0.19.29

➢  terraform --version
Terraform v0.12.4
```

Can you share the entire log output of your `terragrunt apply` run? That will help in understanding what might be going on here.

It looks like your paths are wrong.
```
terraform plan -var-file=/Users/pkaramol/Personal/terraform-live/environments/staging/pkaramolstg1/aws-vpc/../config.tfvars -var-file=./module_vars.auto.tfvars
```

Note how you have two `config.tfvars`, and the `remote_state_bucket` is set in the `config.tfvars` in the `staging` directory, but terragrunt is pulling in the one in `pkaramolstg1`. This makes sense, because `find_in_parent_folders` finds the first one up the tree.

If you rename the file `pkaramolstg1/config.tfvars` or adding in the `remote_state_bucket` in that file, it should remove the prompt.

**pkaramol** commented *Oct 8, 2019*

Aren't supposed  **all** `config.tvars` up the directory tree to be added as var files and superimposed?
***

**yorinasub17** commented *Oct 8, 2019*

That isn't quite how it works. The output type of `find_in_parent_folders` is a single string representing the path to a single file, not a list of strings corresponding to multiple paths. So it can only get one, and the one it gets is the first one in the tree.

See https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt#find_in_parent_folders for more info.

Thanks for this it was really helpful. I fixed as you suggested.

The only thing now is that the following leaf file configuration:

```
terraform {
  # Example of source in bitbucket (the double // is intentional. Always add it)
  # source = "bitbucket.org/jfotopoulos/terragrunt-test2-modules//ds/metricsdb"
  source = "git::git@github.com:pkaramol/terragrunt.git//aws-vpc"

  extra_arguments "microservice_extra_args" {
    commands = get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars()

    optional_var_files = [
        # find_in_parent_folders("config.tfvars", "ignore"),
        find_in_parent_folders("config.tfvars"),
        find_in_parent_folders("secrets.auto.tfvars"),
        "./module_vars.auto.tfvars",
        "./secrets.auto.tfvars"
    ]
  }
}

include  {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}
```

fails with this error:


```

```

However any quest for `secrets.auto.tfvars` is within an `optional_var_files` block.

And according to the documentation:

> The only difference is that required_var_files will add the extra argument -var-file=<your file> for each file specified and if they don't exist, exit with an error. optional_var_files, on the other hand, will skip over files that don't exists.

Why is it failing then?
***

**yorinasub17** commented *Oct 14, 2019*

This is because terragrunt needs to resolve all the functions to interpret the config, and so every function needs to return correctly. Given that, `find_in_parent_folders` with one arg errors out if the file can't be found, and so it can't resolve that function and fails the config.

To resolve this, you need to pass the second arg to `find_in_parent_folders` (`""` is probably good enough) which the function will return when it can't find the file.

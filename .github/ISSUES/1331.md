# Pulling modules from github with ssh and conflicts with versions.tf

**ac-hibbert** commented *Sep 8, 2020*

I have in my root ```terragrunt.hcl``` a way of generating a ```versions.tf```, so that I can ensure across terraform the providers are tied to a specific version

```
# Generate versions for providers
# Note: This will overwrite a versions.tf file in the module
generate "versions" {
  path      = "versions.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite"
  contents  = <<EOF

# Set required_providers as per https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws        = "2.68.0"
    local      = "1.4.0"
    null       = "2.1.2"
    datadog    = "2.11.0"
    template   = "2.1.2"
    archive    = "1.3.0"
  }
}

EOF
}
```

For the most part this works fine. Upstream modules may have a ```versions.tf``` file as well but the local one overwrites this. It seems okay for public github.com and modules stored in the registry e.g. https://registry.terraform.io/modules/cloudposse/elasticache-redis/aws/0.18.0 but when using ssh I get messages like the following:

```
Hit multiple errors:
error downloading 'ssh://git@<ghe>/<module.git>?ref=1234abc': /usr/local/bin/git exited with 1: error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:
	versions.tf
Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
Aborting
```

This happens when I run once, change the github ref and run init again. It is fixed by clearing the .terragrunt-cache directory

Is there a better way of doing this?

Let me make sure I understand correctly:

1. You have a `terragrunt.hcl` file that generates a `versions.tf` file.
1. This `terragrunt.hcl` has a  `source` URL like `ssh://git@...?ref=vX.Y.Z`.
1. When you  run `terragrunt xxx` commands initially, it works fine.
1. However, if you update the `ref` parameter  on the `source` URL, you get the error about committing or stashing your changes?

Is that right?

Yes, you got it right. I am also facing a similar issue.
***

**brikis98** commented *Jan 14, 2021*

Could you share the commands and full log output of what you're running to help investigate this?

Now first I store my tf configuration in git for reusability. 

So the main thing here when I make changes to code e.g adding or removing any resource. then pushed to a git repo with the next version git tag.

After this process when I tried to run it says I need to commit code, I am confused because terragrunt is retrieving code and storing it in the .terragrunt-cache folder automatically.

So here to when I make changes in the git tag version I have to delete the cache folder then perform terragrunt init command again downloads code, and works fine.

```
# stage/terragrunt.hcl
terraform {
  source = "git@github.com:********/tg-versioning001.git//dev_tf?ref=v0.0.3"
}

#Keep your backend configuration DRY
remote_state {
  backend = "azurerm"
  generate = {
    path      = "backend.tf"
    if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  }
  config = {
	resource_group_name  = "*******"
        storage_account_name = "*******"
        container_name       = "*******"
	key = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform2.tfstate"
	}
}

inputs = {
  location = "West US"
  env_name = "prod"
}

```

So here is command initial plan which i have run to content in cache folder should be automatically updated with the code.

```
$ terragrunt plan --terragrunt-debug

And last I have created a separate azure based remote state file for each environment.

Oh, I think I see what's happening. You have some module `foo` in a Git repo that you are referencing via a `source` URL. When you run `terragrunt apply` the first time, [Terragrunt uses the `go-getter` library to `git clone`](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/75846560df6904f004748e62954f02bc6d4f0372/cli/download_source.go#L367) the `foo` repo into the `.terragrunt-cache` folder. This `foo` repo has some `bar.tf` file in it, but you also happen to have a `generate` block in your Terragrunt config that overwrites this `bar.tf`. Now that the code downloading and code generation are done, Terragrunt runs `terraform apply` in that `.terragrunt-cache` folder.

You then update your `source` URL (e.g., specify a different `ref`) and run `terragrunt apply` again. Since [the `source` URL changed](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/75846560df6904f004748e62954f02bc6d4f0372/cli/download_source.go#L84), Terragrunt realizes it doesn't have the latest code, and tries to `git clone` it again by calling `go-getter` again. But since there's a local diff in that `.terragrunt-cache` folderâ€”the `bar.tf` file has been changedâ€”Git won't let you, and gives the error above.

The solution is probably to have Terragrunt clean up the checkout path before calling `go-getter` / `git clone`. PRs are welcome.

I use override functionality to override the versions.tf: https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/files/override.html .But faced the same issue when I tried to override .terraform-version file in the module rep.  So I am also interested in improvement when terragrunt can update the repo with changed files.

I am hitting a similar issue when running `terragrunt plan-all --terragrunt-non-interactive --terragrunt-include-external-dependencies` , even though there are no local changes and it is the first time the command is being run. It is a multi-dependency hierarchy and the modules are being cloned in `.terragrunt-cache`
Clearing the .terragrunt-cache works sometimes but it errors out on the next dependency.

```

Does it work reliably as a workaround if you pass in [--terragrunt-source-update](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli-options/#terragrunt-source-update)?
***

**itsavvy-ankur** commented *Feb 4, 2022*

@yorinasub17  the only way I could get it to work is by adding the `--terragrunt-download-dir` option like `terragrunt plan-all --terragrunt-non-interactive --terragrunt-include-external-dependencies --terragrunt-download-dir ~/tfcode` and also removing the password from my ssh private key ( ðŸ˜ž, could be due to some timeout issue ), without these two hacks kept running into the issue above. So progress for now , although does look a bit odd.

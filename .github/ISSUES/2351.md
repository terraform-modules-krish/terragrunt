# Only run the command on modules that have the specified file.

This allows to manage workspaces and vars files easily

I would create `--terragrunt-layer-has-file` argument to filter terragrunt modules.

exemple:

```bash
TF_WORKSPACE=staging ./terragrunt run-all plan --terragrunt-layer-has-file=/vars/staging.tfvars
```

with the following terragrunt config:

```terraform
terraform {
  extra_arguments "var_file" {
    commands = [
      "apply",
      "plan",
      "import",
    ]
    required_var_files = ["vars/${get_env("TF_WORKSPACE")}.tfvars"]
  }
}
```

Hello,
proposed changes, in the end, look specific for one specific case - I was wondering can't be used `--terragrunt-include-dir / --terragrunt-strict-include` options to pass only dependencies which have required `.tfvars`. file?

Hey @denis256  ðŸ˜„

Thanks for considering my pull request for Terragrunt. While I appreciate the team's suggestion of a pre-calculation option for the list of directories to process, I've tested it out and found that it's not very practical for everyday use.

As an alternative, I suggested a feature that only runs a command on modules with a specified file, which I think is a more practical and efficient solution for managing modules and workspaces in Terragrunt. This feature not only simplifies the process of managing modules, but also addresses a common request from the Terragrunt community for a workspace management tool. Plus, my pull request has been tested and is ready to be merged, so I believe it would be a great addition to the tool.

If you have any further questions or concerns about my proposal, feel free to let me know. Thanks for your consideration.

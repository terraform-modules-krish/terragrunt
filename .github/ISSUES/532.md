# [question] use "TF_VAR_*" with terragrunt 

**ozbillwang** commented *Aug 1, 2018*

I think it is obvious, but not. 

When I use TF_VAR_* variable in terragrunt,  for example,  deploy a new tag within target definition in ECS, it doesn't work with `TF_VAR_tag=0.1.2`

    TF_VAR_tag=0.1.2 terragrunt plan

This tag need by dynamic changed after new build and deployment

How can I do that?

We use `TF_VAR_xxx` all the time with Terragrunt. Can you share your code so we can see why it's not working for you?

@brikis98 

I can confirm the problem now.  Using `gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example` as sample


If I don't put the variable/value in `non-prod/us-east-1/qa/webserver-cluster/terraform.tfvars`, when setting `TF_VAR_xxx` with `terragrunt plan|apply`, it works.

But if I put some variables in the `terraform.tfvars`, in case, it is `tag="0.0.1"`, and want to dynamically  change the value on fly with `TF_VAR_tag=0.1.2 terragrun plan`, it always pick the value in `terraform.tfvars` as `0.0.1`

This is actually the design in Terraform. Per [their docs](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html#variable-precedence):

> Values passed within definition files or with -var will take precedence over TF_VAR_ environment variables, as environment variables are considered defaults.

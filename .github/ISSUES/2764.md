# dependency init check and auto-init check are different

**dctrwatson** commented *Oct 20, 2023*

**Describe the bug**
The way terragrunt determines if it needs to run auto-init and how the dependency code determines if a stack has already been init-ed are different mechanisms. The latter only does a very naive check for `.terraform` existence.

**Expected behavior**
The dependency init check to match the auto-init check.

**Versions**
- Terragrunt version: v0.52.3
- Terraform version: 1.5.7
- Environment details (Ubuntu 20.04, Windows 10, etc.): Ubuntu 22.04

**Additional context**
We cache `.terraform/modules` for CI/CD since downloading modules can be quite unreliable. However, if we try filter what stacks are run, we have the issue where terragrunt tries to use `terraform output -json` for dependent stacks that aren't auto-init'd (even with `FetchDependencyOutputFromState` enabled.)

# Add function for getting Terraform working directory

**GergelyKalmar** commented *Sep 20, 2022*

It would be great to have a `get_terraform_dir()` function which returns the path to the directory in which the Terraform commands are run (it is usually something like `./.terragrunt-cache/xxx/yyy`).

I would need this value in a locals block for constructing relative paths. I tried `run_cmd("pwd")` but that actually seems to be equivalent to `get_terragrunt_dir()`. Is there perhaps another way of obtaining this already?

It seems that the `WorkingDir` entry in `terragrunt-info` does return what I would need, however, I can't really seem to find a way to get this value in a `terragrunt.hcl` file.

What's the specific use case here? I believe path_relative_to_include() is what you need, as that should get you what `WorkingDir` gives you (the counterpart being `path_relative_from_include()`. Although that does not line up with the `.terragrunt-cache/` dir you mentioned, so not sure this is what you want?

I don't think that would work because my setup is roughly as follows:

`~/.terragrunt/commons.hcl`
```hcl
locals {
  ...
  working_dir = ".terragrunt-cache/config_hash/module_hash"
}
...
```

`~/Projects/some-project/terragrunt.hcl`
```hcl
include "commons" {
  path = pathexpand("~/.terragrunt/commons.hcl")
}
```

The `commons.hcl` file essentially contains my common provider and remote state configuration (and a few other things) which I then simply include in all of my projects. What I need is the relative path from `terragrunt_dir()` to the `WorkingDir` or an absolute path to `WorkingDir` (and not the path between `~/.terragrunt/commons.hcl` and `~/Projects/some-project/terragrunt.hcl`).

The specific use case is that I want to modify module sources in Terraform files before running Terraform (I do that via a before_hook) so that instead of pointing to a remote source they point to a local path, for which I need to find out the relative path between the local checkout of a module source and the `WorkingDir`. I know the paths to the local module sources but I can't really get the `WorkingDir` via any of the existing functions in Terragrunt, I think.

As said, if I run `terragrunt terragrunt-info` then I get something similar to this:
```
{
  "ConfigPath": "/home/user/Projects/some-project/terragrunt.hcl",
  "DownloadDir": "/home/user/Projects/some-project/.terragrunt-cache",
  "IamRole": "",
  "TerraformBinary": "terraform",
  "TerraformCommand": "terragrunt-info",
  "WorkingDir": "/home/user/Projects/some-project/.terragrunt-cache/EmQr60XXXCYgt9Qfni-4fHZU/F62jYYYnH_hVGDEN2pTYiMsg"
}
```
where WorkingDir is exactly what I would need, just inside `~/.terragrunt/commons.hcl`.

I just noticed that the working directory is sometimes the same as `get_terragrunt_dir()` (in particular when there are no remote configurations specified, see https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/caching), which makes this feature even more important.

my usecase would be to access an image file to use in the `gitlab_group` resource as avatar with a relative path so that the path stays the same for all developers. the file is located in the project root directory in an assets folder.

file structure reduced to the relevant files/directories:

it would be possible to access the file with an absolute path with the `get_repo_root()` function but this stores the absolute file from a specific developer in the states file. so if the next developer checks out the project in a different folder and runs the terraform command we get a new directory.

the paths i get from all the available functions don't help
```
debug_paths = {
      + get_original_terragrunt_dir = "/project/accounts/production/gitlab"
      + get_parent_terragrunt_dir   = "/project/accounts"
      + get_path_from_repo_root     = "accounts/production/gitlab"
      + get_path_to_repo_root       = "../../../"
      + get_repo_root               = "/project"
      + get_terragrunt_dir          = "/project/accounts/production/gitlab"
      + path_relative_from_include  = "../.."
      + path_relative_to_include    = "production/gitlab"
    }
```
`get_path_to_repo_root()/assets/gitlab/logo.png` and `path_relative_from_include()/assets/gitlab/logo.png` result in a file not found as the real working directory is the cache directory which i moved to `plugin_cache_dir   = "$GIT_REPO_ROOT/.terraform.d/plugin-cache"` for the sake of a single location and not polluting all my source directories.
this results in the path `.terraform.d/.terragrunt-cache/accounts/production/gitlab/SgKLvr5BkpwOBF27O_KMq4ZY5O0/JFRlN212e_19ZPmP_aI4z1wvWck/gitlab`. to access the logo from `main.tf` in the resoucre `gitlab_group` i would need 8 levels of "up" `../../../../../../../../` which is not provided by a function. so the request for a function `relative_from/to_working_dir()` looks valid and quite important to me.

i tried to use the path functions without  and partly with the double slash `//`.

```
locals {
  config_defaults = {
    debug_paths = {
      path_relative_to_include = "${path_relative_to_include()}//"
      path_relative_from_include = "${path_relative_from_include()}//"
      get_repo_root = "${get_repo_root()}//assets/gitlab"
      get_path_from_repo_root = "${get_path_from_repo_root()}//"
      get_path_to_repo_root = "${get_path_to_repo_root()}//assets/gitlab"
      get_terragrunt_dir = "${get_terragrunt_dir()}//"
      get_parent_terragrunt_dir = "${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}//assets/gitlab"
      get_original_terragrunt_dir = "${get_original_terragrunt_dir()}//"
    }
  }
  config_gitlab = yamldecode(file("${get_repo_root()}/config/gitlab.yaml"))
}
```
workarounds:
- use absolut path and ignore that there is a change output all the time for different developers
- hardcode a variable containing the required "directory-ups"

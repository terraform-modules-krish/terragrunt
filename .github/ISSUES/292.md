# New interpolation function for plan files

**dmlemos** commented *Sep 13, 2017*

After adapting the scripts to use plan files, I noticed that I can no longer use this function `get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars()`. The `apply` command doesn't take var parameters when using the plan file.

Instead of listing all the commands in all the tfvars files, I would prefer to continue to use the portability of a function.

I'd like to ask for an additional function that includes commands that need vars, **except apply**.
`get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars_for_planfile()`

Seems reasonable. Another alternative is to have a more general-purpose helper along the lines of `filter` or `exclude`:

```
exclude(get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars(), ["apply"])
```

PRs welcome :)

That would be beneficial too üëç

In my view the ideal scenario would be that the existing function *get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars* would return two different lists of commands, depending on whether a plan file is being applied or not. Therefore, *apply* would be included in the returned list of commands if no plan file is being applied, and excluded otherwise.

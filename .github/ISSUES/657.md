# Terragrunt destroy not destroying aws infrastructure

**bab5470** commented *Feb 15, 2019*

I can do a `terragrunt apply` and it'll create a bunch of resources. But if I immediately follow that with `terragrunt destroy` - it says there's nothing to destroy and I have to go delete things by hand. I'm pretty sure that's not how its supposed to work. :) Why is this happening? I'm running v0.17.4.

Hard to say without more info! What does your Terraform module look like? And your Terragrunt config in `terraform.tfvars`? And the log output from `apply` and `destroy`?

@brikis98 Having this same issue as well with `destroy`. `apply` creates simple RDS module below.

```
provider "aws" {
  region = "${var.aws_region}"
}

resource "aws_rds_cluster" "aurora-mysql" {
  engine                  = "aurora-mysql"
  engine_version          = "5.7.mysql_aurora.2.03.2"
  instance_class          = "${var.instance_class}"
  database_name           = "${var.database_name}"
  master_username         = "${var.master_username}"
  master_password         = "${var.master_password}"
  backup_retention_period = 5
}

```

`terraform.tfvars`:

```
terragrunt = {

  include = {
    path = "${find_in_parent_folders()}"
  }

  terraform {
    source = "git::ssh://git@bitbucket.org/myrepo/my-aws-modules.git//aurora"

    extra_arguments "custom_vars" {
      commands = [
        "plan",
        "apply",
        "import",
        "push",
        "refresh",
        "destroy"
      ]
    }
  }
}

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# MODULE PARAMETERS
# These are the variables we have to pass in to use the module specified in the terragrunt configuration above
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

aws_region = "us-east-2"

database_name  = "my_db_name"
instance_class = "db.t2.micro"

master_username = "admin"
```

Output from `terragrunt destroy`:

Do you really want to destroy all resources?
  Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

  Enter a value: yes


Destroy complete! Resources: 0 destroyed.
```

How are you storing Terraform state?
***

**ahummel25** commented *Jun 6, 2019*

@brikis98 How do you mean exactly?

Looks relatively empty in my `live` project.

```
{
    "version": 3,
    "terraform_version": "0.11.14",
    "serial": 1,
    "lineage": "3c1f3828-3540-3281-4c20-a940cb48559a",
    "modules": [
        {
            "path": [
                "root"
            ],
            "outputs": {},
            "resources": {},
            "depends_on": []
        }
    ]
}

```

How do I update state so it reflects my actual infrastructure?
***

**brikis98** commented *Jun 10, 2019*

There is something wrong with how you've configured your state. Since there's nothing in the state file, when you run `destroy`, Terraform doesn't know what to destroy. Without seeing your Terragrunt config and Terraform config, it's hard to say what the issue is!

Closing as stale. If this is still an issue, please file a new issue sharing the `terragrunt.hcl` configuration containing the `remote_state` or `generate` blocks, as those are critical for debugging this issue. Thanks!

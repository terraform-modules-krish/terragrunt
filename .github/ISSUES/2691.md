# Native Terraform functions doesn't work in included configuration

**enarmontas** commented *Aug 30, 2023*

**Describe the bug**
Native Terraform functions are ignored in included configurations.

**To reproduce**
Define `locals` block that lists all available files in specific directory using Terraform [`fileset` function](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/fileset).

`terragrunt/example/terragrunt.hcl`:
```hcl
include "root" {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

include "module" {
  path = "${get_path_to_repo_root()}/terragrunt/common/modules/ec2-instance.hcl"
}

locals {
  users_path  = "${get_path_to_repo_root()}terragrunt/common/users"
  users_files = fileset(local.users_path, "*.hcl")
  user_names  = [for user in local.users_files : read_terragrunt_config("${local.users_path}/${user}").locals.name]

  debug_path  = run_cmd("echo", "Users path: ${jsonencode(local.users_path)}")
  debug_files = run_cmd("echo", "Users files: ${jsonencode(local.users_files)}")
  debug_names = run_cmd("echo", "User names: ${jsonencode(local.user_names)}")
}

inputs = {
}
```
Here is the execution result:

```bash
$ terragrunt plan                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Users path: "../../terragrunt/common/users"
Users files: ["user1.hcl"]
User names: ["user1"]
...
```

Now if I move that `locals` block to the include named `module`, the result is different.

`terragrunt/common/modules/ec2-instance.hcl`:
```
terraform {
  source = "git::git@github.com:terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-ec2-instance.git//."
}

locals {
  users_path  = "${get_path_to_repo_root()}terragrunt/common/users"
  users_files = fileset(local.users_path, "*.hcl")
  user_names  = [for user in local.users_files : read_terragrunt_config("${local.users_path}/${user}").locals.name]

  debug_path  = run_cmd("echo", "Users path: ${jsonencode(local.users_path)}")
  debug_files = run_cmd("echo", "Users files: ${jsonencode(local.users_files)}")
  debug_names = run_cmd("echo", "User names: ${jsonencode(local.user_names)}")
}
```
`terragrunt/example/terragrunt.hcl`:
```hcl
include "root" {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

include "module" {
  path = "${get_path_to_repo_root()}/terragrunt/common/modules/ec2-instance.hcl"
}

inputs = {
}
```

Execution result:
```bash
$ terragrunt plan                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Users path: "../../terragrunt/common/users"
Users files: []
User names: []
```

It seems that `fileset` function was ignored and didn't produce any result.

**Expected behavior**
Terraform functions should work at any level, not just child configurations. At least from what I understand.

**Versions**
- Terragrunt version: 0.44.5
- Terraform version: 1.3.9
- Environment details: macOS 13.2.1

Not a bug, just misunderstanding how the relative paths work in Terragrunt. I used `get_repo_root` function instead of `get_path_to_repo_root` and it works as expected.

Terragrunt docs:
```
Note: Any file* functions (file, fileexists, filebase64, etc) are relative to the directory containing the terragrunt.hcl file theyâ€™re used in.
```

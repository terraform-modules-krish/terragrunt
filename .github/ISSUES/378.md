# Terragrunt doesn't de-dupe external dependencies for confirmation prompts

**brikis98** commented *Nov 20, 2017*

When you run one of the `xxx-all` commands in a folder `foo`, Terragrunt walks the dependency tree, and one of the first things it does is identify all dependencies outside of the `foo` subtree, and confirm whether you want to run `xxx-all` in those subfolders (e.g., to ensure we don't `apply` or `destroy` in a dependency you don't want to affect).

It seems that this confirmation process is not de-duping the external dependencies, so it asks to confirm the same ones over and over again multiple times.

I'd like to revive this issue if you don't mind @brikis98 

We're getting our kubernetes provider configuration from our EKS module, which itself depends on our VPC module for inputs. This results in really long wait times if you have application states that rely on each other.

I think we'd need some kind of deduplication on dependencies here but haven't taken a look at the code yet.

Hi, are you using `dependency` blocks, or `dependencies`? If you are using the former, can you create a different issue and update the title to `terragrunt doesn't reuse outputs of dependencies`? This issue is referring to a different problem related to `dependencies` blocks.

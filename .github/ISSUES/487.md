# Tagging for DynamoDB table and S3 Bucket

**BernhardBln** commented *Jun 12, 2018*

Wonderful that terragrunt creates the DynamoDB table and the S3 bucket for us, but it would be very cool if we could pass on some tags to add to both, as we have to tag all our resources and it's difficult to tag them later when they already exist.

Ideally it could look like this:

```
terragrunt = {
  remote_state {
    backend = "s3"
    config {
      bucket         = "my-terraform-state"
      key            = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
      region         = "us-east-1"
      encrypt        = true
      dynamodb_table = "my-lock-table"

      s3_bucket_tags = {
            owner = "team a"
            name = "Terraform state storage"
      }

      dynamotable_tags = {
            owner = "team a"
            name = "Terraform lock table"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You could use these two maps internally when creating bucket / table; I guess you need to filter them out though when passing them on to terraform?

Neat idea. I'd be open to a PR that adds this! We may want to keep the tag configurations outside of the `config` block so we don't have to filter them.

Haha, well, my first thought was "that'll be easy to add", the second "oh no it's go..." :P 

But I can give it a try. 

But where would you suggest to place the tags, @brikis98? To me it feels artificial to place them outside of remote_state (or even outside of config), that's why I thought filtering would make more sense?

I'd probably put tags in `remote_state`, but not in `config`.

Alright, so I will try with

```
terragrunt = {

  remote_state {

    backend = "s3"

    config {
      bucket         = "my-terraform-state"
      key            = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
      region         = "us-east-1"
      encrypt        = true
      dynamodb_table = "my-lock-table"
    }

    s3_bucket_tags = {
          owner = "team a"
          name = "Terraform state storage"
    }

    dynamotable_tags = {
          owner = "team a"
          name = "Terraform lock table"
    }

  }
}
```

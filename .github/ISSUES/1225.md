# Can't retrieve outputs from data block

**AzySir** commented *Jun 19, 2020*

Apologies if this is a basic question. 

I've created this module -  

```
data "aws_iam_policy_document" "policy" { 
    version = "2012-10-17"
    policy_id  = var.policy_id


    dynamic "statement" {
        for_each = var.statements
        content {
            effect = statement.value["effect"]
            actions = statement.value["actions"]
            resources = statement.value["resources"]

            dynamic "condition" {
                for_each = statement.value["condition"]
                content {
                    test     = condition.value["test"]
                    variable = condition.value["variable"]
                    values   = condition.value["values"]
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

I want to read the output of this to my S3 module. But I literally can't seem to find how. I have the outputs set and it's displayed when I do a terragrunt apply. However when I reference the output(or data) in the S3 module I receive the below error

```
A data resource "aws_iam_policy_document" "policy" has not been declared in
the root module.
```

I've tried both below combinations with the S3 Module 

```
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "s3_bucket" {
  bucket = "mybucket-${var.environment}-${var.domain}-${var.name}"
  acl    = var.acl
  policy = data.aws_iam_policy_document.policy
}
```


```
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "s3_bucket" {
  bucket = "mybucket-${var.environment}-${var.domain}-${var.name}"
  acl    = var.acl
  policy = output.output_policy
}
```

I wish the documentation was a little easier to understand but basically I got this working with a help of a friend.

Between the "inputs" and the "dependencies" documentation it is amazingly confusing.

Basically this is what I did (with his help)

First he linked me this. I read it but it still missed/wasn't clear enough on what the "inputs" actually does.

https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/?fbclid=IwAR1P1l5So-ElyC_ExvYHKIlEFvqXPnBASd3BMjqHdf40EzSAlKw7IZ-HnSU#dependency

In the example or discussion of inputs it makes it sounds like it stores an environment variable which sounds like a dirty work around.

What it actually does is read the input from the dependency and stores it as a variable {}.

Steps to fix 

1. Declare a variable you will read into. Your output block will be read into this from your dependency. 
```
variable "policy" {
    type = string
    description = "asd"
}
```

2. Set your dependency (terragrunt.hcl)
```
dependency "policy" {
  config_path = "../policy"
}
```

3. Read your output from your dependency (terragrunt.hcl)
```
inputs = {
    policy = dependency.policy.outputs.output_policy
}
```

4. Use your output inside of your module (main.tf) - Refer to policy section 
```
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "s3_bucket" {
  bucket = "cbus-${var.environment}-${var.domain}-${var.name}"
  acl    = var.acl
  policy = var.policy
}
```

Took me a while to find this and there was literally not one clear example of this just a reference to environment variables.

https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/inputs/

"Whenever you run a Terragrunt command, Terragrunt will set any inputs you pass in as **environment variables**."

Sorry you struggled with this. Do you have suggestions on how to make the docs clearer?

**AzySir** commented *Jun 22, 2020*

@brikis98 all you have to do is literally show other usages. I would've loved to create a PR.

I would've thought a more common use case was to read the variables from the dependencies.  Then use those variables inside of some resources.

By all means correct me if I'm wrong. I don't see much value to below personally. 

```
$ terragrunt apply

# Roughly equivalent to:

TF_VAR_instance_type="t2.micro" \
TF_VAR_instance_count=10 \
TF_VAR_tags='{"Name":"example-app"}' \
terraform apply
```

I think this (image below) also highlights that the documentation here may have taken a back seat. Why can't this be -

```
Input > Usage with Environment Variables 
Input > Usage with Resources
```
_(After a resource usage example has been added)_

PRs are welcome!

This shows that Terragrunt is setting those `inputs` as environment variables. Which seems to be what you were confused about? Is this not clear because you aren't familiar with this syntax for setting environment variables?

Not sure I 100% follow, but if you think adding new sections to the `inputs` docs would be helpful, a PR is welcome!

No I'm well aware of what environment variables are but why would you be saving the number of instances as an environment variable? I mean every now and then, yes possibly. But again the more common use case I would've thought was reading a dependency variable!

I'll add a PR on the page but I don't think I can edit the section can I? would have something like this

Do these docs work for you in terms of explaining the usage you are looking for? https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/execute-terraform-commands-on-multiple-modules-at-once/#passing-outputs-between-modules

If so, perhaps we could move it verbatim under inputs for better discoverability.
***

**AzySir** commented *Jun 22, 2020*

@yorinasub17 It does - but I still think that can be written better. I actually got to this page (after my bashing head against this for a while) and overlooked declaring a `variable block` for the `inputs`. 

Embarrassingly I'm happy to admit here I should have correlated this better! However idea of documentation is for it to be easy to follow and in this case it's just as simple as one detailed example and/or better flowing documentation  
***

**yorinasub17** commented *Jun 22, 2020*

I agree our docs can be better. The tricky part about all the docs is that you need to understand how terragrunt works at a high level with inputs, and then how terragrunt handles multiple modules, before you can understand how dependencies work. Otherwise, it won't be clear that the `dependency` block is taking the outputs of another module and passing it as inputs, and that it needs to be applied first (or applied with `apply-all`) before you can get the data (even if the module is just data sources).

Even if we add the docs under `inputs`, I worry if it would still be buried given that it is not a natural place for people to look unless they are reading through the docs top to bottom.

Not quite sure what the best approach is here...

---

With that said, I just realized that our docs never introduce `inputs` in the quickstart. We only mention it in passing at the end in "Promote immutable, versioned Terraform modules across environments", yet it is a very important piece of the config.

Perhaps one improvement is to start by introducing inputs in the introduction of the quick start?
***

**AzySir** commented *Jun 22, 2020*

@yorinasub17 Terragrunt is a fantastic tool!! Even though there is that added level of complexity and pre-knowledge is required, Terragrunt finds a unique challenge because they have to attempt to follow the KISS principles whilst explaining a more complex solution (than say basic Terraform).

My recommendation would be to almost mirror the Terraform documentation in some way. If you think about it - no one is going directly to Terragrunt without coming via the Terraform route right? Is there an opportunity here to align the "basic terragrunt concepts" in a way that mirrors Terraform docs (whilst also providing examples)?

Then there could be more in-depth explanations?

Just a thought I'm happy to put something together for inputs and create a PR 

***

**yorinasub17** commented *Sep 27, 2021*

Since OP, we have an updated quick start that introduces `inputs` much earlier in the docs. I think this is probably the best we can do here for now regarding this confusion, so will close.

If there are other suggestions or follow ups, please open a new ticket with updated context. Thanks!

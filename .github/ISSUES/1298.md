# Terraform block required version

**moosahmed** commented *Aug 14, 2020*

when not using terragrunt we used to use a terraform block with required version defined, so tfswitch could automatically download and use the terraform to meet the requirement.

Something like this would exist in versions.tf in the directory where the module block is defined and where `terraform apply` is run.

versions.tf
```
terraform {
  required_version = "< 0.13"
}
```

tfswitch would then keep terraform updated for the newest 0.12.X that is available. 

How can this be used with terragrunt?

Does it work if you have a `before_hook` that calls `tfswitch`?

I've tried, but it looks like it tries to find the terraform_binary before it executes hooks. Do you have a working example?

What error are you seeing? Can you share the logs? Would also help if you can share the `before_hook` configuration.

We don't use `tfswitch` so I'm kind of working off the docs here. If I understand how `tfswitch` works, there should always be a `terraform` in the PATH that resolves to some version, which may or may not be correct. This should pass the `terraform_binary` check.

The way the above proposal works is that it will call `tfswitch` in the `before_hook` and update that symlink before `terragrunt` calls it for the actual command. So in theory that should work.

I might be able to provide some more pointers if you can share your config and logs.

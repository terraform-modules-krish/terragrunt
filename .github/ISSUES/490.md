# How to upgrade Terraform provider plugins and modules

**rafilkmp3** commented *Jun 19, 2018*

Hi, 

there is any way to make the terragrunt update the plugins and modules like i can do with ?
```
terraform init -upgrade
terraform get -update
```

but I would like to do like a get-all instead remove /home/user/.terragrunt to get the latest aws provider to all my modules
<br />

You can certainly run `terragrunt get -update` or `terragrunt init -upgrade`. There is no `init-all` or `get-all` command currently though.

A workaround could be to place this hook Inside your terragrunt.hcl file to run it each time you run terragrunt plan/plan-all or apply/apply-all

```
terraform {
  // This runs before every apply or plan to download the lastest modules
  before_hook "update_mods" {
    commands = ["apply", "plan"]
    execute  = ["terraform", "get", "-update"]
  }
}
```

In addition to the workarounds mentioned above, we also now have [run-all](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli-options/#run-all) so you can run `terraform run-all init -upgrade`.

Closing as the question has been solved and stale. Please open a new issue if this is still relevant to you!

did you mean `terragrunt run-all init -upgrade`?

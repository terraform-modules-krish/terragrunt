# How to reference resources created within same module

**venkat51286** commented *Aug 21, 2018*

I am trying to create security group and its rules in a file called `rds_security_group.tf` 
```
resource "aws_security_group" "rds_security_group" {
  name = "rds_security_group"
  description = "The security group that should be used for the RDS cluster instances"
  vpc_id = "${data.aws_vpc.selected_vpc.id}"
  tags {
    Name = "${var.env}-${var.app_name}"
  }
}
```
I want to reference this security group ID in another file `rds_instance.tf` where I am creating the actual RDS instance. (If I already have a hard-coded SG ID, I will reference as this `rds_security_group_ids = ["${var.vpc_secgroup_id}"]`). How can I reference the SG ID from rds_security_group.tf to rds_instance.tf 
I know if I want to reference one module resource with other module, I can use outputs but how about within module.
PS: If I create all resources within same .tf file, it works. But I don't want to create a giant .tf file.

Thanks

If the `.tf` files are in the same folder, they can reference each other just as if they were in the same file.

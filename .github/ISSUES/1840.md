# Better way to handle cloud authentication and cloud helpers

**yorinasub17** commented *Sep 30, 2021*

Currently terragrunt offers configuration parameters to specify what IAM role to assume when calling terraform:

- `iam_role`
- `iam_assume_role_duration`
- `--terragrunt-iam-role` (CLI arg)

Note that prior to https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1807, the behavior was different between the `terragrunt.hcl` configurations and the CLI arg: the IAM role configurations in `terragrunt.hcl` were only used prior to calling terraform, whereas the `--terragrunt-iam-role` CLI arg was used for all authentication terragrunt does.

Specifying `iam_role` in `terragrunt.hcl` has the following drawbacks even after #1807 :

- It complicates the parsing logic as now terragrunt needs two passes: one to parse out the IAM parameters, and then that can be used to resolve cloud functions. The two passes introduce a complexity where cloud functions change in value depending on the parsing stage. See the complexity in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1807
- The `iam_role` assumed can't be used in `run_cmd`.
- It prevents usage of various blocks like `dependency` to configure the `iam_role`.

The pain of maintenance and the complexities involved with configuring terragrunt auth in the same configuration as `terragrunt.hcl` is really messy, and for that matter, all the cloud related support like auto-init and cloud helper functions.

We should consider revamping the cloud support in terragrunt. Some ideas:

1. Either remove all auth from Terragrunt and require that it's handled externally. Or, alternatively, have first-class auth functionality, but handled separately than the rest of the config. This would need a design.
1. Either remove all "data fetching" from Terragrunt and require that it's handled externally. Or, alternatively, have first-class data source support: conceptually, I imagine a separate Terraform module with a bunch of `data` sources and output variables, we run `apply` on that first, and then expose it to your config similar to a `dependency` block; you can then use all that fetched data in your config, and we run `apply` on the module you have in `source`.
1. Either remove all "Auto Init" for remote state for Terragrunt and require that it's handled externally. Or, alternatively, have first-class remote state support: conceptually, I imagine a separate Terraform module that creates your remote state resources (e.g., S3 bucket, DynamoDB table) and provides info about them via output variables, we run `apply` on that first, and then expose it to your config similar to a `dependency` block; you can then use that data in your config, and we run `apply` on the module you have in `source`.

Bumping this issue as important to address in perhaps Terragrunt 2.0.

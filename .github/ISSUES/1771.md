# Terraform Registry Support: Add support for token configuration that terraform supports.

**yorinasub17** commented *Aug 17, 2021*

The initial version of Terraform Registry support introduced an environment variable for providing API tokens to terragrunt, but this [is not how terraform authenticates](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/registry/using.html#on-the-command-line). We should update the feature to support parsing the terraform authentication configuration.

Note the following caveat from the original PR:

> Ideally we would be able to reuse code from Terraform. However, terraform has moved to packaging all its libraries under internal so that you can't use them as a library outside of Terraform. To respect the direction and spirit of the Terraform team, I opted for not doing anything funky to workaround the limitation (like copying those files in here).

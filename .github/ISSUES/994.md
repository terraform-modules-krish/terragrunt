# Why is terragrunt.hcl required?

**tjarjoura** commented *Jan 9, 2020*

I am a new user of terragrunt. We have a lot of different terraform directories corresponding to different bits of infrastructure. Since it is just a wrapper around terraform I would expect the default behavior to simply call terraform, but instead it gives me an error "terragrunt.hcl: no such file or directory". 

I noticed that simply adding an empty file "terragrunt.hcl" in the directory gets around this issue. So why require the file to be there at all? It seems to just needlessly complicate things and clutter the filesystem. As of now we either need to add a blank terragrunt.hcl file to each terraform directory that we have (which is quite a few), or switch back and forth between the terraform and terragrunt command depending on if the configuration file exists, but obviously it would be nice if we could just use the same command for all workflows.

Not a contributer, a newish user...it has a ton of impact.  First consider this `terragrunt.hcl`
test/webservers
```
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

terraform {
  source = "/src/infrastructure/modules//live/webservers"
}
```
test/terraform.hcl
```
remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    bucket = "myco-tfstate"
    region = "us-east-1"
    key = "test/${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
    encrypt        = true
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks-test"
  }
}
locals {
  default_yaml_path = find_in_parent_folders("base.yaml")
}

inputs = merge(
  yamldecode(
    file("${get_terragrunt_dir()}/${find_in_parent_folders("region.yaml", local.default_yaml_path)}"),
  ),
  {
    aws_profile = "default",
    environment = "staging",
    aws_creation_key = "foo-bar-key-pair"
  }
)
```

Here not only can you create an `inputs = {}` block in `test/web/terraform.hcl`, but it will be merged with your environment definitions as well.  So you'll end up with variables `region, aws_profile, environment, aws_creation_key` in any submodule like `test` then you can make these available using `variable environment {}` in test and it will be automatically filled.

This is a really simple example...you'll also notice that i'm including a module, which contains a template that can take all of these variables....normally i have a `servers` block which is a `map(map(string))` that defines all of the desired inputs for my `test` state. which allows me to create many servers in a loop  using `for_each var.servers` and so many other options.

There is not a lot of great documentation around this, actually that is not true.  Most/All documentation is showing a simple path, to extend it requires a bit of trial and error.  Which is why i wanted to reply to this, but if you continue to search, you'll find the beauty of terragrunt environment states and modules in order to keep your code as DRY as possible.  I use reddit/r/Terraform as well as the main terraform list, there are a lot of good people out there to help.

HTH...if i said anything wrong, please anyone correct me...i wrote this rather rapidly.

The file is used to configure Terragrunt. Without it, you don't get any of the benefits of using it (e.g., keeping backend configuration, CLI args, and variables DRY)!

Being able to gradually transition to using Terragrunt is an interesting idea, but would it be misleading? E.g., If you have some modules configured with `terragrunt.hcl` (e.g., to use a certain backend, add some extra CLI flags, and set some variables) and some without, then if someone blindly runs `terragrunt apply`, they will get totally different behavior for each one... Seems like that might lead to more surprises / errors than having to explicitly note if a module is ready for use with Terragrunt or only Terraform?

One more point I want to add here is that the `terragrunt.hcl` file is the way terragrunt knows which modules should be included in an `apply-all`. This is most helpful when you have a single repo for both live config and terraform modules, because otherwise running `terragrunt apply-all` at the root of the repository would start deploying the terraform modules and in most cases that is not desired behavior.

# Question: terragrunt plan will delete all running resources?

**jcomeaux** commented *Dec 15, 2018*

I've run 'delete-all' and now have a problem due to my ignorance of the recursiveness of that command.

I now have running resources in a VPC; when I run `terragrunt plan` the plan results in "Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 11 to destroy".  Again, these assets are running, and I want them to continue running.

I've tried setting the DEBUG flag and nothing jumps out at me.  I've also tried deleting all the terragrunt & terraform caches, tried refresh and untaint on all the resources....nothing seems to clear the "delete flag" (if that's a thing).

Any advice is most appreciated.

`terragrunt plan-all` does not delete resources. It just runs `plan` in each subdirectory. If you are seeing "xxx to destroy" in your plan, that's the output of your `plan` command for whatever reason. Perhaps you have messed up the `source` paths and it's running the wrong module in some subdirectory?

The `source` path was indeed the problem; We so rarely touch the vpc code guess we overlooked some shifting around of the paths.

Thanks so much!

# terragrunt 0.42.3 (403 AccessDenied)

**masteredd** commented *Jan 19, 2023*

I'm trying to run terragrunt plan (v0.42.3) and get an issue:

`ERRO[0002] AccessDenied: Access Denied
        status code: 403, request id: NW1NBVWQ18D51DF1, host id: VU0cZ2hP0soOsxxnCRByZ5Vv8fnPkaShk2cvs6LQ5PN6xndPYwbsmdHXYDXNTETdpY0zRNyi844= 
ERRO[0002] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1 `

When i cd into `.terragrunt-cache/../../` i noticed that there is no .terraform directory at all.
I run `terraform init` there - .terraform directory was created and `terragrunt plan` starts working.
I noticed that issue related to `.terraform` directory and terrafrom.tfstate file especially.

Terraform version is 1.3.6
AWS IAM user permissions:
`            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:PutEncryptionConfiguration",
                "s3:PutBucketVersioning",
                "s3:PutBucketTagging",
                "s3:PutBucketPublicAccessBlock",
                "s3:PutBucketPolicy",
                "s3:PutBucketLogging",
                "s3:PutBucketAcl",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:GetBucketVersioning",
                "s3:GetBucketLogging",
                "s3:GetBucketAcl",
                "s3:CreateBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::*tfstate/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::*tfstate"
            ]
`

P.S. terragrunt (v0.36.1) works fine with the same IAM user.
It looks like something was changed in new versions

it failed with this error:
`DEBU[0000] Error checking if SSE is enabled for AWS S3 bucket s3-bucket-tfstate: AccessDenied: Access Denied
        status code: 403,`

2 ways how to fix that:
1. disable_bucket_update = true
2. provide additional permission s3:GetEncryptionConfiguration

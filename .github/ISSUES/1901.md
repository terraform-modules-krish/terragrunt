# Autoinit no longer works

**yorinasub17** commented *Nov 3, 2021*

Gruntwork team is running into issues with autoinit. Specifically, the case where the module source ref being updated to a new ref is no longer being handled by autoinit.

## Repro:

- Create a `terragrunt.hcl` that references a module by ref.
- Run `terragrunt apply`
- Update `ref` to a new tag.
- Run `terragrunt apply`

### Expected:

Terragrunt runs `init` as part of auto init on the second apply

### Actual:

Terragrunt proceeds to call `terraform` without `init`, leading to a module source change error.

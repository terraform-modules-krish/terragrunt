# Links are not copied - results in "no such file or directory"

When terragrunt is copying its workspace to a temp folder for execution, it appears to
not follow or find files which are links.  Is this intended functionality?
I recently pulled in a git submodule which had links and it caused the problem.
I'm also using the --terragrunt-source option.

Terragrunt: v0.14.10
Terraform: v0.11.7

Thanks!

I may have jumped the gun here, looks like this error is coming from terraform during the "terraform init" command being invoked by terragrunt.  Sorry!

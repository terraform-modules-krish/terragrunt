# Publish Terragrunt docker image to ECR Gallery

It would be great to have a Docker image available on: https://gallery.ecr.aws/ to avoid the pull rate limit.

Thoughts?

I'll hand roll my own one as it seems like there's no official one.

100% agree! Having an official one will be very helpful, instead of backing our own one :-/. Specially for CI/CD!

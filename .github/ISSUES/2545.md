# AWS S3 ACL changes blocking creating S3 buckets.

**keyur-patel-imprivata** commented *Apr 24, 2023*

We are utilizing this module to create our access-log buckets and with Recent AWS S3 changes , our IaC failing to create S3 buckets. As its not allowing to enable ACLs on S3.

Hi,
looks like the issue occurs during terraform execution, most probably this should be raised in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-security/ repository

From `terraform-aws-security` examples, I see were defined `bucket_ownership` for `private-s3-bucket`:
```
  bucket_ownership = "ObjectWriter"
```

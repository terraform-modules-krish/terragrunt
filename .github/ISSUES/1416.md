# Dependency fails to create Terraform dot directory and state file

**franz-josef-kaiser** commented *Nov 4, 2020*

### Task:
Version remote state by changing location.
1. Use [GitLab managed Terraform State as the Terraform state storage backend](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/infrastructure/#gitlab-managed-terraform-state).
1. Change remote state location when Git tag is incremented:

    ```https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/<PROJECT_ID>/terraform/state/<ENV>-<GIT_TAG>```

### Attempt:
Use [`external` data source](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/external/latest/docs/data-sources/data_source).
1. Use `external` data source to run `git` command.
1. Present data as `output`.
1. Utilize _Terragrunt_ `dependencies` to set execution order.
1. Utilize _Terraform_ `dependency` to extract the data and load it into `inputs` for usage.

The directory structure is the following:
```shell_script
$ tree
.
├── modules
│   └── version
│       ├── bin
│       │   └── version.sh
│       ├── main.tf
│       └── terragrunt.hcl
├── prod
│   └── main
│       └── terragrunt.hcl
└── terragrunt.hcl
```

The **root `terragrunt.hcl`** has the following contents (`locals` omitted) to build the `backend`s `config` data like the remote state backend `address`:
```hcl

dependency "data" {
  config_path = "${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/modules/version"
}

dependencies {
  paths = [ "${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/modules/version" ]
}

remote_state {
  backend = "http"
  config = {
    address        = "https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/${local.project_id}/terraform/state/${local.env}-${dependency.data.outputs.tag.version}"
    lock_address   = "https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/${local.project_id}/terraform/state/${local.env}-${dependency.data.outputs.tag.version}/lock"
    unlock_address = "https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/${local.project_id}/terraform/state/${local.env}-${dependency.data.outputs.tag.version}/lock"
    username       = local.username
    password       = local.token
    lock_method    = "POST"
    unlock_method  = "DELETE"
    retry_wait_min = 5
  }
  generate = {
    path      = "backend.tf"
    if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  }
}

inputs = {
  version = dependency.data.outputs.tag
}
```

The **version `module`** is simply a call to a shell script and an `output` to make data available to the root `backend:config`.
```
data "external" "this" {
  program = [
    "sh",
    "./bin/version.sh"
  ]
}
output "tag" {
  value = data.external.this.result
}
```

<details><summary>
(open shell script)

The shell script itself is simply a call to `git`, wrapped in a call to `jq` to transform the output to valid JSON.
</summary>
<p>

```python
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -eo pipefail
VERSION=$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0 | sed 's/\.//g')
jq -n \
  --arg version "${VERSION}" \
  '{"version":$version}'
```
</p>
</details>

### Problem
Fetching the Git tag and providing it to Terraform or Terragrunt seems to fail with `output` not being created up front.

<details><summary>(open full log)

Running `terragrunt plan` runs `terraform init` in the `module/version` (dependency) folder and creates the `.terraform-cache/` dir. It then fails because of a missing `output`. The `terraform.tfstate` file has **not been created**.
```python
[terragrunt] 2020/11/04 12:32:50 /path/to/root/modules/version/terragrunt.hcl 
is a dependency of /path/to/root/prod/main/terragrunt.hcl but detected no outputs. 
Either the target module has not been applied yet, or the module has no outputs. 
If this is expected, set the skip_outputs flag to true on the dependency block.
```

The following providers do not have any version constraints in configuration,
so the latest version was installed.

To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking
changes, we recommend adding version constraints in a required_providers block
in your configuration, with the constraint strings suggested below.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

Switching to the `modules/version/` dir manually and calling `terragrunt init` does not change this. Still there is no `terraform.tfstate` file that holds the `output`. And neither is there a `.terraform` dir.

The `.terraform` dir will only get created when calling `terraform init` inside the `modules/version/` dir manually.

So after running `terraform init; terraform refresh` in the `modules/version/` dir manually, creates the output. It can then get used by the root `terragrunt.hcl` to construct the `remote_state` `address`, etc.

I tried using a `before_hook` to trigger the generation, but nothing runs before `init`.

There's also the thing, that this would need a manual refresh after each single Git tag generation.

In the end, I used the Bash script and let it simply run with 
```python
address = "[…]${run_cmd("${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/bin/version.sh", "")}"
```
I just have to make sure to `echo -n` the `$VERSION` instead of outputting JSON. (Note: `-n` to avoid new lines at the end`).

### Questions:

1. Am I doing something wrong with the external data source as dependency? Could this be solved easier _this_ way and without needing the manual initialization and refreshing?
1. Any chance we can use `local exec` here?
1. Any chance to run anything pre `init`?
1. Is there a better way than just stuffing this as `inputs`/ Env vars inside the `terragrunt.hcl` file?

Did you ever run `apply` on the `version` module? If you didn't, then no state file will exist, and calling `terraform output` will fail with the error shown.

**brikis98** commented *Nov 5, 2020*

Also, you can simplify things by using [`run_cmd`](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/built-in-functions/#run_cmd) to run your script, instead of a separate module.

**franz-josef-kaiser** commented *Nov 5, 2020*

@brikis98 I used `run_cmd` in the end, as written above. 

Out of curiosity: Can you imagine a way to make this easier than running the dependency as if it would be a completely separate project with separate state, etc.? For e.g. with a [`local-exec` provisioner](https://www.terraform.io/docs/provisioners/local-exec.html)? I could not get this to work. Thanks in advance!

**brikis98** commented *Nov 6, 2020*

If `run_cmd` works, why do you need dependency?
***

**franz-josef-kaiser** commented *Nov 8, 2020*

I don't. I am just curious and want to learn.

Closing this as the original question has been answered. If there are any follow ups, please open a new ticket with updated context. Thanks!

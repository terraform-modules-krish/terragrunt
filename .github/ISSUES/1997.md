# GCS bucket creation fails when service account impersonation is performed from another service account

**pansarshrek** commented *Jan 25, 2022*

Hi,

I'm trying to use Terragrunt on GCP with a GCS based remote backend for the Terraform state. We use a setup with service account impersonation to do our deploys. We have one service account with an access key that authenticates and then impersonates a second service account that has access to the different required Google APIs. 

The Terragrunt remote config looks like this:
```
remote_state {
  backend = "gcs"

  config = {
    project                     = local.project_id
    bucket                      = "${local.project_name}-tf-state"
    prefix                      = path_relative_to_include()
    location                    = local.gcp_region
    impersonate_service_account = local.service_account
    skip_bucket_creation        = true
    skip_bucket_versioning      = true
  }

  generate = {
    path = "backend.tf"
    if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  }
}

```

When running Terraform we run into the following error, Terragrunt fails to auto initialize the GCS bucket:
```
Create GCS bucket YYYYYYYY returned an error: Post "https://storage.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b?alt=json&prettyPrint=false&project=ZZZZZZZZ": impersonate: status code 403: {
  "error": {
    "code": 403,
    "message": "Request had insufficient authentication scopes.",
    "status": "PERMISSION_DENIED",
    "details": [
      {
        "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.rpc.ErrorInfo",
        "reason": "ACCESS_TOKEN_SCOPE_INSUFFICIENT",
        "domain": "googleapis.com",
        "metadata": {
          "method": "google.iam.credentials.v1.IAMCredentials.GenerateAccessToken",
          "service": "iamcredentials.googleapis.com"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Terragrunt and Terraform versions:
```
➜ terraform -v
Terraform v1.1.4
on linux_amd64
➜ terragrunt -v
terragrunt version v0.29.10
```
I also tested terragrunt version v0.36.0, with same result.

If we reconfigure the remote to skip bucket creation and versioning and instead create the bucket manually everything works and Terraform can access GCP using SA impersonation without any problems.

I did some digging around and it seems like a similar problem was discovered some time ago in the Terraform project (https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28139) but it has now been resolved by replacing one of the libraries (cloud.google.com/go/storage) used for communicating with GCP APIs. It looks like Terragrunt is still using the cloud.google.com/go/storage library (https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/go.mod#L7), so that makes me think that's the root cause of the issue I'm encountering.

Looks like we need to upgrade to `google.golang.org/api/impersonate` package

@pansarshrek faced exactly the same issue when setting up Atlantis. Was hitting the wall for few weeks.
I am very eager to see mechanics of `remote_state {}` fixed. As a workaround I have found u got to use `generate "backend.tf` for this. then it skips all the GCS "impersonated" calls that lib under the bonnet doesnt handle well. But this arises the issue that with generate - dependency optimizations are not done, it takes AGES to plan module, because init is done in each dependency. (i found this [here](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1422#issuecomment-1012549187) and added my comments to the issues this brings)

Great if this is as simple as upgrading the impersonate package!

@denis256 Any input on this please?

Hi,
I will look on this issue this week

@denis256 how is your dela going? ☺️ 
chasing only because you did give a time.
This bit is causing so much pain, happy to assist if a good pointer is given. (have go experience)

Hi,

I created this WIP PR #2052.
I need to do additional tests but similar modifications were made in Packer tool (`googlecompute` plugin) to make it work with the Google Cloud impersonation mechanism: it was OK.

Hello, I'm encountering the same problem. Is there any workaround for this? Using the same set-up with a remote GCS state bucket, and the CI SA impersonating the TF SA to access the state bucket.

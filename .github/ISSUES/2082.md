# terragrunt does not pass -backend=false to terraform

**luispabon** commented *Apr 26, 2022*

Looks like terragrunt swallows the `-backend=false` flag during init ops. We need this to run linting against the codebase on an execution env that has no credentials.

```
~ terragrunt init -backend=false
╷
│ Error: Backend initialization required, please run "terraform init"
│ 
│ Reason: Initial configuration of the requested backend "s3"
[...]
~ terragrunt init -backend=false --terragrunt-no-auto-init
╷
│ Error: Backend initialization required, please run "terraform init"
│ 
│ Reason: Initial configuration of the requested backend "s3"
[...]
```
However, with terraform directly:

```
~  terraform init -backend=false

You can achieve the same result using an environment variable and the `remote_state.disable_init` attribute.

As per the [documentation](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/keep-your-remote-state-configuration-dry/#create-remote-state-and-locking-resources-automatically):

Running into the same and the disable_init option doesn't fix it. I'll have to prolly add the credentials just to be able to validate which sucks as it works out of the box with plain terraform.

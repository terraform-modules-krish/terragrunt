# Destroy command should automatically warn about dependencies

**brikis98** commented *Sep 27, 2017*

Terragrunt allows you to specify modules you depend via [`dependency`](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#dependency) or via . When a user runs `terraform destroy`, we should automatically find modules that depend on the current module, and warn the user that destroying the current one may cause issues for the others. 

I believe this would work as follows:

1. Use `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` to find the root folder in the Git repo. If it fails, either because this isn't a Git repo or `git` isn't installed, see if the current module has an `include` block, and use the path within as the root folder. If there's on `include` block, perhaps log a warning that no checks can be done.

1. Go into the root folder and find all Terragrunt modules within that folder.

1. Scan the `dependency` and `dependencies` block of each of those modules.

1. If any modules list the current module as a dependency, warn the user that deleting the current module may cause problems for those other modules and prompt for a yes/no confirmation to proceed. Skip this confirmation if the user specifies the `--terragrunt-non-interactive` flag.

In non-interactive mode I'd like to see this fail with a non-zero exit code unless you provide another switch that explicitly permits the forced behaviour.

Hm, that would be quite backwards incompatible with current behavior, but it's probably the correct thing to do from a technical perspective... Not sure the best way to go on that one.

@denis256 could you look into this one?

This was implemented in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.33.0

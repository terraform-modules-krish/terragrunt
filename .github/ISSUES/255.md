# Terragrunt User Agent for API request

**qrevel** commented *Jul 20, 2017*

It would be usefull for CloudTrail debugging.
I found a similar issue for [Terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/5020).

Ah, that seems like a good idea. Terragrunt doesn't make too many API calls to AWS itself, but for the ones it does, we should add this. PRs welcome!

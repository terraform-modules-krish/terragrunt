# terragrunt plan -out && terragrunt show gives an error

**basarsoker** commented *Apr 28, 2022*

Some third-party tools want to use `terragrunt run-all plan -out` and `terragrunt show` sequentially for different purposes. 
I am aware of [this](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/720#issuecomment-497888756) known issue, hence I try to get a tfplan via only `plan`  instead of `plan-all` but still the `show` command outputs me an error related to a dependency.
For example, here is a plan command and its stdout. As you may see there is no problem with `plan`
```
$  terragrunt plan  --terragrunt-ignore-external-dependencies  -out <<file-path>>

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_elasticache_parameter_group.default[0] will be created
  + resource "aws_elasticache_parameter_group" "default" {
      + arn         = (known after apply)
      + description = "Elasticache parameter group"
      + family      = "redis4.0"
```
and this is the result of the show command. 
```
$ terragrunt show $(find .  -name <<file-path>>) 
ERRO[0021] <<path-to-dependency>>/terragrunt.hcl is a dependency of <<path-to-main-terragrunt>>/terragrunt.hcl but detected no outputs. Either the target module has not been applied yet, or the module has no outputs. If this is expected, set the skip_outputs flag to true on the dependency block. 
ERRO[0021] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1 
```
Could you help me to overcome this issue?

I had never thought that I would have to add `show` to the `mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands`  array. But still please be aware that running `terragrunt run-all plan -out `and `terragrunt show` sequentially gives an error.

# Configure after_hooks to only run if terraform apply actually made changes

**conorgil** commented *May 2, 2019*

This is a feature request.

We are using terraform to create a kubernetes cluster and then using an `after_hook` to perform some custom actions after the cluster is created/updated. However, these changes take some time and we do not want them to run unnecessarily.

It would be great if we could somehow configure the `after_hook` to only run if `terragrunt apply` actually made changes. If no changes were made, then it can just happily exit and not run the `after_hook` script.

I think this would actually be kind of tricky to implement because terragrunt would have to somehow determine whether terraform actually made changes or not.

The exit code will be 0 in both scenarios:
1) there are no changes to make
2) there are changes to make and it successfully makes those changes

So, it will likely have to parse the terraform stdout or something. Gross.

Also, you can configure an `after_hook` to run after any command (init, plan, apply, etc). So, we would need to think through a generic configuration to update the `after_hook` syntax with. For example, does this idea/concept even make sense with a `terragrunt init`? Maybe, if it does not have to init, then it doesn't run the script? Needs some thinking

Sanity check: can you use a `null_resource` with a `local-exec` provisioner instead? That way, you can control when that runs using the `triggers` to tie to specific resources.

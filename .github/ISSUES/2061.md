# Question: How to use terragrunt in a distributed architecture where each apps .hcl files live in the same repository?

**dgokcin** commented *Apr 7, 2022*

Hi all

So in our Infrastructure, we have common terraform modules and common resources .hcl files(like vpc, alb) in one repository and application related code(source code, s3 bucket hcl file that the app needs, etc.) in many repositories.

I wonder what is the best practice to use terragrunt in a repository structure described above where it is aimed to keep the infrastructure related code next to the source code. 

For instance, I need to access the outputs of the vpc or the listener arns of the alb and they are in the common repository. What is the easiest way to read the outputs without using the dependency block since it does not support paths of remote hcl files.

I have already tried submodules but they are causing me problems when I want to use a PR automation tool like spacelift, env0 or atlantis.

Hi,
I was thinking that may help `terragrunt output -json` on infrastructure modules to get outputs, and use `jsondecode` in application modules to load inputs

I thinks it might work. The downside is I need to commit the same file to each repository and will have a lot of hardocded values inside my repos. how about writing needed outputs to parameter store inside terraform modules?

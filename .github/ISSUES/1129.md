# AWS CLIv2 and AWS SSO auth fails

**stevie-** commented *Apr 9, 2020*

We are using new aws cli v2 SSO auth feature. This works with aws cli, but terragrunt fails to get credentials.

```bash
$ aws --version
aws-cli/2.0.6 Python/3.8.2 Darwin/18.7.0 botocore/2.0.0dev10
```

`.aws/config`

```ini

[profile 123456789012-AWSAdministratorAccess]
sso_start_url = https://d-123456789.awsapps.com/start
sso_region = eu-west-1
sso_account_id = 123456789012
sso_role_name = AWSAdministratorAccess
region = eu-west-1
output = json

```

Check aws cli works

```bash
$ export AWS_PROFILE=123456789012-AWSAdministratorAccess
$ aws sso login

S3 bucket config from `terragrunt.hcl`. We checked setting AWS `profile` here as well. No change.
```hcl

    skip_bucket_versioning = true
  }

I believe the new SSO functionality only works with the newest version of the AWS SDK, so all CLI tools that use the SDK (such as Terragrunt) would need to be updated first. Would you be up for a PR to bump the AWS SDK version? You could test locally to see if that fixes the issue for you.

**stevie-** commented *Apr 9, 2020*

PR = PullRequest -- my GOlang is very basic. I doubt that I can handle it.


Found this changelog:
https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#release-v12530-2019-11-07

v1.25.30 added support for SSO, maybe related.

**lorengordon** commented *Apr 9, 2020*

AWS SSO is going to be a mess across the community because it does not make credentials available in a way that works with the current credential chain. Each SDK will need to implement support for the new credential chain, and perhaps each tool also (depending on how they setup their chain).

For GO, see: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/issues/3186

**jsaevitzon** commented *Apr 10, 2020*

I also started getting these errors last night around 7pm.
***

**brikis98** commented *Apr 10, 2020*

Ah, good catch @lorengordon... If this isn't implemented in the AWS Go SDK, then we won't be able to do anything until it is. 
***

**lorengordon** commented *May 28, 2020*

Fwiw, here is a workaround using `credential_process` until more SDKs support the AWS SSO credential chain...

**urz9999** commented *Jan 14, 2021*

In case like this one or other similar cases where AWS SSO result in incompatibilities with your library and you don't want to play with workarounds or complicated fixes, maybe you can give a try to our open-source project: [https://github.com/Noovolari/leapp](https://github.com/Noovolari/leapp). It deals with AWS SSO authentication and accounts/roles retrieval then it creates short-lived temporary credentials in .aws/credentials to maximize compatibility with third party tools / sdks.

**hereandnow** commented *Feb 3, 2021*

this should be fixed in the AWS Go SDK in version 1.37: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/releases/tag/v1.37.0

can we somehow get this into terragrunt? i am not that familiar with go, but for my understanding it should be only updating the version here: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/a7c0d434970c8519f5bec377e9c5bee9df25a6e7/go.mod#L7 ?

can someone confirm? if so, i would be able to provide a PR

**idcmp** commented *Feb 8, 2021*

I've checked out master and bumped aws-sdk-go to v1.37.6 and rebuilt.

I've got the following in `~/.aws/config`:

```
[profile RoleNameHere-999999999999]
sso_start_url = https://my.awsapps.com/start
sso_region = us-east-1
sso_account_id = 999999999999
sso_role_name = RoleNameHere
region = us-east-1
output = json
```

I have `AWS_PROFILE=RoleNameHere-999999999999` and can confirm running `aws sts get-caller-identity` works.

When I run my home-made terragrunt, I get:

```
ERRO[0006] /home/idcmp/src/stuff/terragrunt/terragrunt.hcl:4,46-65: Error in function call; Call to function "get_aws_account_id" failed: NoCredentialProviders: no valid providers in chain. Deprecated.
	For verbose messaging see aws.Config.CredentialsChainVerboseErrors. 
ERRO[0006] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1 
```
With both Terraform and the AWS Provider now supporting SSO credentials, it would be great if Terragrunt followed suit.

I can confirm that building terragrunt locally after updating `go.mod` to use go sdk version `1.37.7` (https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/releases/tag/v1.37.7) that AWS SSO support now works.

Are you using the latest terraform aws provider version that is also required to support SSO:

**sylr** commented *Feb 15, 2021*

Ok so I finally made it work by compiling both terraform and terragrunt linked against `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go@v1.37.10`.

My use case involves several AWS accounts spread in a tree looking like that:

```
terragrunt-workspace/aws/dev/terragrunt.hcl
terragrunt-workspace/aws/dev/eu-west-1/terragrunt.hcl backend.tf main.tf ... etc
terragrunt-workspace/aws/dev/eu-west-3/terragrunt.hcl backend.tf main.tf ... etc
terragrunt-workspace/aws/prod/terragrunt.hcl
terragrunt-workspace/aws/prod/eu-west-1/terragrunt.hcl backend.tf main.tf ... etc
terragrunt-workspace/aws/prod/eu-west-3/terragrunt.hcl backend.tf main.tf ... etc
```

With `terragrunt-workspace/aws/<account>/terragrunt.hcl`:

```hcl
remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  config  = {
    profile        = "<account>" # IMPORTANT
    bucket         = "<account>-terragrunt"
    key            = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "eu-west-3"
    encrypt        = true
    dynamodb_table = "<account>-terragrunt"
  }
}
```

`terragrunt-workspace/aws/<account>/<region>/main.tf`:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 3.27"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region                      = "<region>"
  profile                     = "<account>"
  skip_credentials_validation = true
}
```

`terragrunt-workspace/aws/<account>/<region>/backend.tf`:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    profile = "<account>"
  }
}
```

`~/.aws/config`:

```ini
[default]
region = eu-west-1
output = json
csm_enabled = true

[profile dev]
sso_start_url = https://d-xxxxxxxxx.awsapps.com/start
sso_region = eu-west-1
sso_account_id = yyyyyyyyyyyyy
sso_role_name = RoleName

[profile prod]
sso_start_url = https://d-xxxxxxxxx.awsapps.com/start
sso_region = eu-west-1
sso_account_id = yyyyyyyyyyyyy
sso_role_name = RoleName
```

`<account>` needs to be replace by the appropriate profile name.

With this I can run `terragrunt run-all plan` in the `aws` dir without needing to set any AWS_PROFILE env var. This however requires that I have valid sso session for all the SSO profiles so I made a quick `aws sso login` wrapper.

```shell
#!/usr/bin/env bash

for account_dir in aws/*/; do
    aws sso login --profile="$(basename $account_dir)"
done
```

**oscarmorasu** commented *Feb 22, 2021*

Thanks for starting this work @z0mbix 

Note Terraform already supports SSO creds started with version [0.14.6](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/releases/tag/v0.14.6) (for the backend) and in version [3.26.0](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/releases/tag/v3.26.0) for the Provider

I had to pin Terraform 0.14.5 + Provider 3.25.0 until Terragrunt also supports SSO. The reason is I am not using AWS Key/Secret Key, but I leverage the [aws-sso-credential-process](https://pypi.org/project/aws-sso-credential-process/) to bridge the gap.

Basically my profiles in the `.aws/config` file look like this:

``` sh
[profile my-profile]
credential_process = aws-sso-credential-process --profile my-profile
sso_start_url = https://myorg.awsapps.com/start
sso_region = us-west-2
sso_account_id = 1234567890
sso_role_name = MyRole
region = us-west-2
output = json
```

Terraform 0.14.6+ blows up because both the `credential_process` and the `sso` config are present. If I remove the `credential_process` now Terragrunt blows up because it's unaware of the `sso` config and needs the AWS Key/Secret Key.

**UrosCvijan** commented *Feb 26, 2021*

@oscarmorasu How did you manage to work with terragrunt with these specific versions? I fixed the versions as you said, added the profile.. Added the profile in the provider section and in terragrunt.hcl for the remote_state backend configuration. When I run terragrung plan for example I get
Error: error configuring S3 Backend: error validating provider credentials: error calling sts:GetCallerIdentity: InvalidClientTokenId: The security token included in the request is invalid.
        status code: 403, request id: eb986117-f29c-4c87-a999-f6a9af5c2224
Or on a newly created project I get the error when S3 backend should be created:

 terragrunt plan  --terragrunt-source ../../../../terraform//transit-gateway/
Remote state S3 bucket xxxxxxxxxxx does not exist or you don't have permissions to access it. Would you like Terragrunt to create it? (y/n) y
ERRO[0004] Create S3 bucket with retry xxxxxxxxxxx returned an error: InvalidClientTokenId: The security token included in the request is invalid.


Am I missing something?

**oscarmorasu** commented *Feb 26, 2021*

@UrosCvijan, did you install [aws-sso-credential-process](https://github.com/benkehoe/aws-sso-credential-process)?
Actually that tool is deprecated, the author replaced it with[ aws-sso-util](https://github.com/benkehoe/aws-sso-util)

**UrosCvijan** commented *Feb 26, 2021*

Wow, in the meantime I think I managed...Or I made who knows what with lot of credentials etc..  I will have to do it all over again with everything :) Now it looks it might passed, but will have to double check. Didn't see that it is deprecated. I will try the new one.

Ok, so just if anyone else will be using the workaround. I installed aws-sso-credential-process, created all the profiles using aws-configure-sso-profile for my accounts, added also sso_interactive_auth=true, not sure if it is necessary, included profile in my provider section, as well as in remote_state section for the backend creation. There is something strange happening when I run it the first time, it complains about the permissions and says that it cant create the S3 bucket, but it creates it (just ignores all the options), it is created without versioning and without encryption, but it is there, that one and the dynamo table. Then plan/apply works as normal. With this I can easily switch between accounts without having to login to new profile or to fetch the environment variables (AWS access/secret key and token). 
Hoping terragrunt will support this natively cause that would be awesome.

We just updated the AWS Go SDK version in Terragrunt, which, in theory, should allow AWS SSO / AWS CLI v2 to work with the new release: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.28.9 (binaries should show up shortly). Please give it a shot!

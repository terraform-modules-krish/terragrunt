# Disable color output

> is there any way to disable the colored output from the terragrunt binary?

```
 ~ $ terragrunt plan --help | grep color
  -no-color           If specified, output won't contain any color.
 ~ $ terragrunt apply --help | grep color
  -no-color              If specified, output won't contain any color.
```

hi,
most probably will help setting env variable `TF_CLI_ARGS="-no-color"`

That does not works, at least for `hclfmt`

That's is from the logger
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/util/logger.go

And can be disabled by "set `DisableColors` field to `true`"
https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus#formatters


At the same time, in CI envs it should works perfectly

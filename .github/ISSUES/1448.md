# run_cmd is always executed

**ahmad-hamade** commented *Nov 29, 2020*

I need to run a conditional `run_cmd` based on the below:

```hcl
locals {
  condition = true
  value     = local.condition ? run_cmd("echo", "A") : run_cmd("echo", "B")
}
```

Running `terragrunt plan/apply` will execute always both commands:

```
[terragrunt] 2020/11/29 14:45:23 Running command: echo A
A
[terragrunt] 2020/11/29 14:45:23 run_cmd output: [A
]
[terragrunt] 2020/11/29 14:45:23 Running command: echo B
B
[terragrunt] 2020/11/29 14:45:23 run_cmd output: [B
]
```

The expected behavior is to run only `run_cmd("echo", "A")`

I'm using terragrunt version v0.26.7

Ah, yea, that's a bug. Probably related to #1427: something about our parsing is probably executing `run_cmd`, preventing the short circuiting behavior. If anyone has a chance to dig in and fix the issue, a PR is very welcome, as we're buried right now.

Since this is most likely the same issue as #1427, closing in favor of that issue.

@brikis98  I don't think this is the same issue as the one you closed in favor of. The issue here is that when used with a conditional operator, only one of the runcmd commands should be executed. But both are getting executed.

I'm currently on `0.35.10` and the same issue happens.

This is happening for me as well, on `0.35.13`

Also happening for me on v0.36.0. This was not fixed by the fix for the other issue (https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1427#issuecomment-903719132).

A quick chime in. This is definitely still happening as of `v.0.37.1`. If you are really trying to to avoid  executing some command based on environment factors, the work around is pretty ugly. For example:

```terraform
specified_public_ip = get_env("PUBLIC_IP", "")
cmd_args            = (local.specified_public_ip != ""
    ? ["printf", local.specified_public_ip]
    : ["curl", "ifconfig.me/ip"]
  )

  effective_public_ip = run_cmd(local.cmd_args...)
```

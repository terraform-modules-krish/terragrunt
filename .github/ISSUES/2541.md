# Terragrunt not able to process inputs from GitHub OIDC provider

**papunsenapati07** commented *Apr 20, 2023*

Hi Team,  

I am trying to use the wrapper with GitHub OIDC provider similar to https://github.com/startuplcoud/infra-multi-account-region-startup-kit; and using Terraform cloud as backend. When the pipeline is triggered terragrunt is not able to identify the environment variables (TF_VAR_*) variables. 

I went through this document which says https://docs.gruntwork.io/guides/working-with-code/tfc-integration; we should generate *.auto.tfvars file containing the inputs which is did for all inputs accept the one required by AWS provider; can you please help.

# `output-all <var_name>` gives up too easily

**mrtyler** commented *Apr 26, 2017*

### Context

I'm trying to use [Terragrunt-style modules](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt#work-with-multiple-terraform-modules) with [kitchen-terraform](https://github.com/newcontext-oss/kitchen-terraform) for testing. Since kitchen-terraform is designed for the vanilla terraform workflow (whereas I need terragrunt's `apply-all` to invoke modules together) and since kitchen-terraform doesn't provide a lot of flexibility in configuring the terraform commands it issues, I'm working on a [(currently very rough) wrapper script to translate from vanilla terraform to terragrunt *-all](https://github.com/mrtyler/gpii-terraform-live/commit/30e1266a3cecbbe7ce4a7d48591c28de5680580a#diff-097d42ba3303171de8dbd027b51c58af).

kitchen-terraform uses `terraform output` and `terraform output <var_name>` to collect values from the provisioned system (e.g. the `worker` module provides a `public_ip` variable which is used by integration tests that want to connect to the worker instance). I'm not sure why it needs two passes to do this; I'll be looking into that with the `kitchen-terraform` folks next :).

### Demonstrating the problem

Minimal terraform code is [here](https://github.com/mrtyler/terragrunt-star-all-minimal) but it's just this:

```
### ./base/main.tf
output "base_var" { value = "i am base_var" }

### ./base/terraform.tfvars
terragrunt {}

### ./worker/main.tf
output "worker_var" { value = "i am worker_var" }

### ./worker/terraform.tfvars
terragrunt {
  dependencies {
    paths = ["../base"]
  }
}
```

Here's `terragrunt output-all worker_var`:

(Note that terragrunt master contains a bug such that `output-all` visits its dependencies backwards. I'm using my fix from #194 to hopefully make the example easier to follow. If you are trying to reproduce the problem with master, the behavior for `base_var` and `worker_var` will be reversed (or you can build terragrunt including my fix.))

The good news is that the variable we asked for is in the output (`i am base_var`). The bad news is this looks and feels like a failure due to the warning message and non-zero exit code.

Worse, it is now impossible to get variables from the `worker` module since it depends on `base`, which fails. Note that the expected output `i am worker_var` does not appear:

Pragmatically, this is preventing me from getting `kitchen-terraform` and `terragrunt` to play together. Philosophically, I think it is incorrect for `terraform output-all some_variable` to exit non-zero just because `some_variable` isn't defined in every single module, but I am still new to Terraform so please let me know if I'm missing something here.

I'm also new to Go and the terragrunt code base, but my first guess about how to solve this problem would be a new flag passed among `configstack/running_module::waitForDependencies` and friends that ignores errors in dependencies. Perhaps there's a cleaner way?

Just to check that I'm understanding the issue: 

1. You have two modules, `foo` and `bar`. Module `foo` has an output called `XXX`, but `bar` does not.
1. Your run `terragrunt output-all XXX`.
1. Terragrunt exits with an error because output `XXX` does not exist in `bar`.

To be honest, this seems like the correct behavior from Terragrunt, simply because that's the exact behavior from Terraform. If the output you requested is missing, exit with an error. 

That said, it may make sense to add a new flag, such as `terragrunt-ignore-dependency-errors`, which tells the `xxx-all` commands in Terragrunt to run, even if a dependency exits with an error. I'm not sure how common of a use case that is, though.

Hi Yevgeniy! Great to talk to you after reading your blog posts and stalking you in r/devops :p.

Your summary is correct.

> To be honest, this seems like the correct behavior from Terragrunt, simply because that's the exact behavior from Terraform. If the output you requested is missing, exit with an error.

In general I agree: it doesn't make sense to `apply worker` if `apply base` failed. However, I think `output-all` is a special case. Let me try to make my example more concrete.

I have two terraform components, `base` and `worker`. `base` sets up shared infrastructure like networking and routing, so its output contains variables like `subnet_id`. `worker` sets up an instance, so its output contains variables like `public_ip`. The instance needs all that networking stuff to be provisioned before it can do anything, so `worker` depends on `base`. I believe this is a very common Terraform pattern.

I want to fetch `public_ip` so I can pass it off to another tool. I run `terragrunt output-all public_ip`. What do we expect to happen?

Now I want to fetch `subnet_id` so I can pass it off to another tool. I run `terragrunt output-all subnet_id`. What do we expect to happen now?

My expectation in both cases is that I get the variable I want with a successful return code (the presence of warning text about undefined variables is somewhat confusing in this case but not a huge deal compared to exiting non-zero thereby signaling failure to the caller of terragrunt). I don't care that `public_ip` isn't defined in every component -- why would it be? Please give me the single value of `public_ip` that I asked for.

Does this differ from your expectation? Do you expect the two scenarios to behave differently? Because they do :) -- the former returns warnings + nonzero exit code *without* the requested value, the latter returns warnings + nonzero exit code *with* the requested value. At the very least this seems inconsistent to me.

Does this better explain why I think this is a problem? Am I missing something?

>  I'm not sure how common of a use case that is, though.

For `apply-all`, I expect it would be quite rare.

For `destroy-all`, I can imagine a scenario where I just want to destroy everything as fast and as hard as possible, plan to clean up any loose ends afterwards via the AWS console, and don't care about leaving the backend instance up just because the frontend instance hasn't died yet. Probably not very common but plausible, perhaps.

For `output-all`, I think ignoring dependencies should be the default because the alternative is both confusing and preventing me from using `kitchen-terraform` :). That said, based on my experience it appears I am the only human in the galaxy that is trying to use terragrunt-style modules with kitchen-terraform integration tests. I guess that's a pretty uncommon use case! But it is blocking me and may force me to abandon terragrunt in favor of vanilla terraform + templated terraform files.

Out of curiosity, why run `terragrunt output-all XXX` instead of going into the subfolder you care about and running `terragrunt output XXX`? If you don't expect all the outputs to contain the output `XXX`, doesn't it make sense to just ask for the one output you want?

**mrtyler** commented *Apr 26, 2017*

Pragmatic answer: because that's the way kitchen-terraform works. Investigating that is next on my todo list.

Design answer: I like to think of the `*-all` commands as an abstraction that lets me treat a collection of terraform components as a single terraform project. This gives me state isolation for components without having to write my own `for` loop and glue things together. `cd foo && terragrunt output XXX` breaks this abstraction.

Put another way: "why run `terragrunt apply-all` instead of going into the subfolder you care about and running `terragrunt apply`?" :P

A concrete scenario: I have a script that does `cd foo && terragrunt output XXX`. Someone refactors and moves the definition of `XXX` from `foo` to `bar`. My script has to know about that implementation detail. Why? I'd rather write `terragrunt output-all XXX` and let the system figure out where `XXX` happens to be defined.

Is my mental model for `*-all` incorrect, perhaps?

This is a compelling reason, but it seems like it's equally well supported by a `--terragrunt-ignore-dependency-errors` style flag. Is there any way to get kitchen-terraform to pass such a flag?

> why run terragrunt apply-all instead of going into the subfolder you care about and running terragrunt apply

I don't think that analogy works, as it's obvious why the `xxx-all` commands exist, and all of them exit with an error if any dependencies fail. 

> A concrete scenario: I have a script that does cd foo && terragrunt output XXX. Someone refactors and moves the definition of XXX from foo to bar. My script has to know about that implementation detail. Why? I'd rather write terragrunt output-all XXX and let the system figure out where XXX happens to be defined.

The fact that `foo` moved to `bar` is not an implementation detail, but a change in your public API. I don't think blindly papering over it is a good idea in all cases. In fact, it exposes you to a different error condition, where you accidentally add a second output named `XXX` in some other module (e.g. think of common output names like `public_ip` or `id`), and you pick up that output instead of the one you actually wanted. So in general, I'd actually strong recommend using `cd foo && terragrunt output XXX` over `terragrunt output-all XXX`. 

> Is my mental model for *-all incorrect, perhaps?

No, not at all. I agree that using the Terragrunt `xxx-all` commands to treat a set of modules as a single module is compelling. I think the only question is whether the default `output-all` behavior should be consistent with all the other `xxx-all` commands (that is, exit when a dependency hits an error) and perhaps modified via a flag, or if we should change the default for this one command. The latter is less appealing to me, as it would be an exception to the way the rest of the code works, so I'd prefer to enable the behavior you want with a flag. If kitchen-terraform can't handle that, it seems like an issue that should be fixed in kitchen-terraform.

I won't reply to all of your points here. I disagree with a few (which I'm happy to discuss if you're interested) but it seems we have consensus on the usefulness of `--terragrunt-ignore-dependency-errors`. That's what I was after, so I'll stop trying to persuade you :).

I'm fine with leaving the default behavior of `output-all` alone and adding `--terragrunt-ignore-dependency-errors` to the command line myself as needed. If changing `output-all`'s default behavior turns out to be the right thing to do, I'm sure someone will come along and create an Issue requesting it ;.)

My next step is still to see if I can resolve this `output-all XXX` problem from the kitchen-terraform side. Depending on how that goes, I'll then look at implementing `--terragrunt-ignore-dependency-errors`.

Thanks!

After studying the kitchen-terraform code, I don't think it's feasible to fix this problem from that side. I got my hopes up after finding https://github.com/newcontext-oss/kitchen-terraform/pull/113. While that PR does make the situation better, my take (as an admittedly poor Rubyist) is that the Kitchen architecture isn't going to let me look up all the Terraform output variables once and then share that info with everything that needs it. (Put another way, there's no way to prevent kitchen from needing to do `output XXX` at some point.)

Aaron's comment indicates some re-design in their upcoming 1.0.0 release so maybe the situation will be different later.

In the meantime, I'm going to look at adding this flag.

Filed #209. Using `--terragrunt-ignore-dependency-errors` I was able to use `kitchen-terraform` to test my component stack!

Bonus note: even though I'm a Go noob, I found it straightforward to add this feature thanks to terragrunt's sensible organization and excellent collection of tests. Good job, team! 🎉

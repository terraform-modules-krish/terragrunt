# Output json from hcl 

**robcxyz** commented *Apr 29, 2020*

Is it possible to output terragrunt hcl files as a json or do you think it is difficult to implement? Normally in terraform, since the interpretation of the hcl is informed by the provider, this cannot generally be done. But for terragrunt, it seems like there could be an additional command to output json.  Something like `terragrunt json-convert terragrunt.hcl > terragrunt.hcl.json`. Basically like [json2hcl](https://github.com/kvz/json2hcl) but through terragrunt.  

Would this be difficult to implement?  My go is very rough but I can give it a try.  Would be helpful to have this for various code generators and migration assistants along with wrappers and extra tooling that wants to take advantage of terragrunts functions and locals interpretations. 

Thank you for your time.

This isn't easy to do because the `hcl` library isn't very ergonomic, but having something like this seems reasonable as long as it can be implemented in a maintainable fashion.

With that said, we don't have a need for this internally ourselves, so unlikely that we will implement this anytime soon. Happy to review a PR if you are up for contributing, or hopefully someone from the community has the same need and can contribute one.

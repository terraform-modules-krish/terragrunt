# Terragrunt doesn't respect hyphen for indented heredocs for generated files

**jtyr** commented *Mar 17, 2023*

If I have a `terragrunt.hcl` file that contains:

```hcl
generate "provider" {
  path      = "terraform.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  contents  = <<-EOF
    terraform {
      required_version = ">= 1.3.0"
    }
    EOF
}
```

I have noticed that the generated file doesn't respect the heredoc marker `<<-` that should remove the indentation from the text. The current output is this:

```hcl
    terraform {
      required_version = ">= 1.3.0"
    }
```

where it should really be this:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.3.0"
}
```

FYI: The `<<-` marker will only work for tabs but not on spaces. For reference: https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/here-docs.html#LIMITSTRDASH

I understand but that's not how Terraform handles that. For example the following code:

```terraform
resource "local_file" "foo" {
  filename = "${path.module}/terraform.tf"
  content  = <<-EOF
    terraform {
      required_version = ">= 1.3.0"
    }
    EOF
}
```

produces a file with the following content:

```terraform
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.3.0"
}
```

I would expect the same behavior from Terragrunt.

Hi @jtyr,

I didn't manage to repro the issue. Either spaces or tabs, both work as expected.
I copied your example, run `terragrunt init` and got
```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.3.0"
}
```

It only breaks when using tabs with spaces together.  Actually the same behaviour as in terraform.

I used:
Terraform v1.5.3
Terragrunt v0.48.6

I'm closing the issue, but if the issue still exists, feel free to re-open, we'll figure it out.

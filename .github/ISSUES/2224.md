# Failures in `terragrunt render-json`

**infraredgirl** commented *Aug 3, 2022*

`terragrunt render-json` fails when run against certain configurations, e.g. the [for-production/infrastructure-live folder of the terraform-aws-service-catalog](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/tree/master/examples/for-production/infrastructure-live). The error seems to be related to the `find_in_parent_folders()` function and is a variation of the following: 

```
Call to function "find_in_parent_folders" failed: ParentFileNotFound: Could not find a account.hcl in any of the parent folders of /Users/ana/code/terraform-aws-service-catalog/examples/for-production/infrastructure-live/terragrunt.hcl. Cause: Traversed all the way to the root.
```

Files `account.hcl` are located in child directories from `infrastructure-live` and because of this it is failing on `find_in_parent_folders()`:
```
terraform-aws-service-catalog $ find . -name "account.hcl"
./examples/for-production/infrastructure-live/security/account.hcl
./examples/for-production/infrastructure-live/logs/account.hcl
./examples/for-production/infrastructure-live/shared/account.hcl
./examples/for-production/infrastructure-live/stage/account.hcl
./examples/for-production/infrastructure-live/dev/account.hcl
./examples/for-production/infrastructure-live/prod/account.hcl
```

# An `excluded-dir` causes a failure on `run-all apply`

**oatmealb** commented *Jun 27, 2022*

I ran a `run-all apply` from `$BASE_PATH/env_A` (referred to in the error log below). The `Required environment variable` wasn't set indeed, but **should/may an `excluded-dir` be able to cause this, or any, failure**? This `some_service` is a leaf in the dependencies graph.

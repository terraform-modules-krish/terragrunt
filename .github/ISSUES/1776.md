# How does run-all apply works ?

**ArchiFleKs** commented *Aug 20, 2021*

Hi, I'm currently trying to use the run-all (not the plan-all I know this is mostly broken and hard to get to work) command on several module. Repository is available [here](https://github.com/particuleio/teks/tree/main/terragrunt/live/production/eu-west-1/clusters/arm)

For the sake of the example I'm first trying to execute from scratch the `vpc` and `vpc-endpoints` modules. I have dependencies loaded inside vpc-endpoint module with a `read_terragrunt_config`:

```
dependency "vpc" {
  config_path = "${get_original_terragrunt_dir()}/../vpc"

  mock_outputs = {
    vpc_id = "vpc-00000000"
    private_subnets = [
      "subnet-00000000",
      "subnet-00000001",
      "subnet-00000002",
    ]
    public_subnets = [
      "subnet-00000003",
      "subnet-00000004",
      "subnet-00000005",
    ]
    private_subnets_cidr_blocks = [
      "192.168.0.0/16",
      "10.0.0.0/8",
      "172.16.0.0/12"
    ]
    intra_route_table_ids = []
    private_route_table_ids = []
    public_route_table_ids = []
  }
}
```

I try to `terragrunt run-all destroy --terragrunt-parallelism 1 --terragrunt-include-dir vpc --terragrunt-include-dir vpc-endpoints` the first two modules:
* vpc which as no dependencies
* vpc-endpoints which depends on vpc

I get the following error at the end of `vpc` module execution and the start of `vpc-endpoints`:

```
aws_vpc_endpoint.this["s3"]: Creating...

╵                              
```

From my understanding , it should re-read the output of the previously apply module and not use the mock output right ? Or maybe this is by design and I'm missing something. Should the `run-all apply` command be use only if "real` output dependencies are already here ? And therefore cannot be used from scratch ?

I would have to investigate further to know for sure, but my hunch is that this is a bug in the output cache feature of terragrunt. I will be taking a look at this next week.

@yorinasub17 did you manage to get some information on this ? Can I help i any way ?

Hi @ArchiFleKs , sorry for the delay here! I had thought I commented here, but looks like I completely forgot!

This is hitting [this bug](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1128), where terragrunt has no way of introspecting `read_terragrunt_config` to get `dependency` blocks when constructing the graph. Up until recently, there was no way to work around this, but you can now workaround this with [the recently merged multiple includes feature](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.32.0).

Specifically, you want to switch your usage of `read_terragrunt_config` to pull in dependencies with an `include` block that has `merge_strategy = "deep"` so you can access the dependency outputs in the child config.

You can read more about multiple includes in the docs [here](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/keep-your-terragrunt-architecture-dry/). You will also want to take a look at the deep merge docs, [here (under the heading "What is deep merge?")](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#include).

Closing this as a duplicate.

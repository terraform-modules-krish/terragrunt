# Feature request: Generate file, overwrite if Terragrunt signature found, otherwise do nothing

**anlutro** commented *May 15, 2020*

Currently there is the `if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"` option, which according to documentation "overwrites the existing file if it was generated by terragrunt; otherwise, error"

However, it would be nice to have another option which overwrites the existing file if it was generated by Terragrunt, otherwise do nothing, instead of erroring.

An example use case for me would be provider configuration - most of our Terraform configuration should run on the latest version of the provider, but there are exceptions which are affected by bugs, which we'd like to keep at an older version.

We can kind of have this working with `if_exists = "skip"`, but it means we have to manually delete the generated file every time we want to upgrade the provider.

Trying to understand the use case more... For these exceptions, are you manually creating a `provider.tf` file that's checked into version control... But normally, no such file exists... So you want Terragrunt to create (and overwrite?) the file if it was originally written by Terragrunt, but otherwise, do nothing?

Given the exame given in the Terragrunt documentation:

```
generate "provider" {
  path      = "provider.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite"
  contents = <<EOF
provider "aws" {
  region              = "us-east-1"
  version             = "= 2.3.1"
  allowed_account_ids = ["1234567890"]
}
EOF
}
```

This'll generate `terraform.tf` with a Terragrunt signature. If I change the "contents" variable by upgrading to 2.5.0 for example, Terragrunt will update the `provider.tf` in all my directories next time I run `terragrunt apply`.

But let's say one of my directories is affected by a bug so I can't upgrade to 2.3.1. In that case I'd like to remove the Terragrunt signature from the file, downgrade to 2.3.1, and then Terragrunt *won't* replace the `provider.tf` file next time I run a command.

When the bug is fixed (maybe in 2.5.1) I'd be happy to remove the file and let Terragrunt generate it again.

I gotcha, thanks for the explanation. Would you be up for a PR to add a new `if_exists` setting to handle this use case?

Sure thing, I can probably spend some time on it this week.

Any ideas on what the new setting should be called? Something like `soft_overwrite` comes to mind but I'm really not sure.

Thanks! I'm terrible at naming things. I'd probably pick something super verbose like `overwrite_terragrunt_else_ignore`, but feel free to toss out (hopefully better) ideas!

Would [this](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/override.html) help?

It helps indeed!

I'm using it to ignore the EKS managed tags from my VPC component in a `provider-aws_override.tf` file:

```
provider "aws" {
  ignore_tags {
    key_prefixes = ["kubernetes.io/cluster/"]
  }
}
```

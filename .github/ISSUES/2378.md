# How do I debug my local vars?

**dr-egidijus** commented *Dec 2, 2022*

Hello,
I have some `local` vars in my `terragrunt.hcl`
How can I print/evaluate show them ?
Can I see the structure without applying?

The source of my problem is that I am using map, merge, to merge a bunch of aws tags, and the module wants a string, not a map.

But I cannot see what exactly is being passed to the module, I have to rely on my understanding of terraform documentation.

Hello,
may be helpful to use `render-json` command and get data in JSON format

```
terragrunt render-json
terragrunt render-json --with-metadata
```

Thank you @denis256 that is very useful!

I had to create a "debug_vars" module like below.. but it was not as good.

main.tf
```main.tf
resource "null_resource" "terraform-debug" {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo $VARIABLE >> debug.txt"

    environment = {
        VARIABLE = jsonencode(var.debug_vars)
    }
  }
}
```

variables.tf
```variables.tf
variable "debug_vars" {
  description = "accepts any type, any value passed as debug_vars for debugging."
  default     = null
}
```

then in terragrunt.hcl 
```terragrunt.hcl
terraform {
  source = "${get_path_to_repo_root()}//modules//debug_vars"
}

## all your code like locals etc here


inputs = {
  user_pool_name = "${local.user_pool_name}"
  tags = "${local.tags}"
  debug_vars = "${local.tags}"
```

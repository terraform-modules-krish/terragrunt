# Request: Improve output of plan-all with landscape

**flmmartins** commented *Jun 5, 2019*

Hello All,

Would be a possible to integrate plan-all with https://github.com/coinbase/terraform-landscape ?
That would make output better and if there was a way to integrate it would be nice. 
Usually I use it with:

terragrunt plan | landscape

But this only works without the -all.

Best,
<br />

That sounds useful! If anyone is up for a PR that improves the `plan-all` output to support this, would be much appreciated.

Do you accept open source contributions? Is there any guidelines?

Yup we do! Take a look at [Developing Terragrunt](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt#developing-terragrunt) in the README for some of our guidelines. In general, it boils down to:

- If possible, share design in issues before tackling the work. It helps to make sure the implementation details align with the contributors.
- Run code formatters.
- Make sure to add tests.
- Make sure tests pass.

in light of Terraform v0.12's enhanced output formatting and it's incompatibility with terraform-landscape... this seems like a moot issue at this point.

# terragrunt hclfmt should not evaluate interpolations

**barryib** commented *Aug 8, 2019*

It sound like `terragrunt hclfmt` is trying to evaluate interpolations or even using AWS creds.

I'm getting the following error :

```shell
[terragrunt] 2019/08/08 15:08:51 Reading Terragrunt config file at /path/to/root/terragrunt.hcl
[terragrunt] 2019/08/08 15:08:56 /path/to/root/terragrunt.hcl:26,34-57: Error in function call; Call to function "find_in_parent_folders" failed: ParentFileNotFound: Could not find a entity.tfvars in any of the parent folders of /path/to/root/terragrunt.hcl.

[terragrunt] 2019/08/08 15:08:56 Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1
```

Good point! In fact, `hclfmt` shouldn't do any decoding since it doesn't need to! Opened https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/826 as a potential fix.

# Proposal: a (maybe) better way to keep track of versions

**vitorfhc** commented *Mar 14, 2022*

## The problem

Keeping the latest version of anything is hard today. Terragrunt is no different.

Let's take this example:

```terragrunt
terraform {
    source = "git@github.com:gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog.git//modules/services/eks-cluster?ref=v0.84.3"
}
```

Cool, we imported a module with its fixed version `v0.84.3`. But what if I want to easily update it? I would have to go to the code and bump it myself to another version. How can I automate that? I wish there was an easy way.

Version constraints help with that. For example, on Terraform we could do `~>0.84` and it would always update the minor version on any `terraform init`. Would be nice to add this feature to Terragrunt.

## The proposal

How viable is it to make this feature in Terragrunt? I believe there are some ways we could implement that.

One idea would be that `~>0.84` would be equal to:

```terragrunt
terraform {
    source = "git@github.com:gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog.git//modules/services/eks-cluster?ref=v0.84"
}
```

I removed the patch version and now it always gets the latest patch from `v0.84`.

I could also do:

```terragrunt
terraform {
    source = "git@github.com:gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog.git//modules/services/eks-cluster?ref=v0"
}
```

And now we have the latest `v0.x.y`, never going above the major version, which translates to `>= v0.0.0` and `< v1.0.0`.

This is just an idea and one way of implementing that. I would love it since I could automate easily these updates and guarantee the latest versions.

@vitorfhc I think this makes sense and is worth exploring

@vitorfhc spent some time looking into the feasibility of this and discovered that our source download functionality is handled by [hashicorp/go-getter](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter). Any updates to the behavior would have to be made there.

@tonerdo interesting point. But, isn't it possible to parse the url before using go-getter?

Example:

1. I use `ref=v1.2.3` and since this is a valid SemVer with all parts specified I just pass it ahead.

1. But, if I use `ref=1.2.x` we have a variant part which is the patch. Now we query that Git tags and find the latest tag, which `x` is the higher number.

I don't believe this is all new feature, some tools already explored this. It's acting like a middleware between getting the source url and downloading the file.

What do you think?

Edit: [hashicorp/go-version](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-version)

I just use dependabot or renovate to help me keep module versions updated.

Does it work nicely with terragrunt?

Yeah absolutely, or I wouldn't be here!

# Backend not populated

I am trying to follow the migration steps and running into an issue with S3 backend.
```
$ terragrunt --version
terragrunt version v0.12.2
$ terraform version
Terraform v0.9.3

Ah, good catch. That's a bug. We have been using `terraform init` to download the code in the `source` attribute since before Terraform 0.9... I forgot to update that download part to pass the backend attributes to that `init` command. I'll try to fix that tomorrow.

I believe this should be fixed by #177. Please give [v0.12.3](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.12.3) a try (the binaries should show up once the build is done in a few minutes) and let me know if it works for you.

**brikis98** commented *Apr 23, 2017*

Ah, hold up, there is one more bug. See #178 for details. I should have that merged shortly.

@brikis98 thanks for the fix. I can confirm that v0.12.3 works for me.

**brikis98** commented *Apr 23, 2017*

Good to know. That said, I think [v0.12.4](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.12.4) fixes other important bugs... Try it out and let me know how things go.

Will do.

**andrewrynhard** commented *Apr 23, 2017*

@brikis98 v0.12.4 works for me as well.

Great!

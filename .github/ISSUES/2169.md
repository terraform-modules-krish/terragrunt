# FEATURE: Errors with file-level context

**alain-odea-sequence** commented *Jun 28, 2022*

When using Terragrunt with includes and dependencies, you occasionally get a real headscratcher like this:
```
Failed to load state: state snapshot was created by Terraform v1.1.7, which is newer than current v0.12.29; upgrade to Terraform v1.1.7 or greater to work with this state
Failed to load state: state snapshot was created by Terraform v1.1.7, which is newer than current v0.12.31; upgrade to Terraform v1.1.7 or greater to work with this state
ERRO[0014] Could not convert include to the execution context to evaluate additional locals
ERRO[0014] Encountered error while evaluating locals.
ERRO[0014] exit status 1
```

It is logging an issue with state file formats twice and then logging some mystery issue with processing locals.

It would be amazingly joy-bringing for me if Terragrunt had something like this:

```
Failed to load state: state snapshot was created by Terraform v1.1.7, which is newer than current v0.12.29; upgrade to Terraform v1.1.7 or greater to work with this state (while processing dev/ca-central-1/dev/data-stores/s3-datalake)
Failed to load state: state snapshot was created by Terraform v1.1.7, which is newer than current v0.12.31; upgrade to Terraform v1.1.7 or greater to work with this state (while processing dev/ca-central-1/mgmt/services/openvpn-server)
ERRO[0014] Could not convert include to the execution context to evaluate additional locals (while processing dev/ca-central-1/_global/route53-public)
ERRO[0014] Encountered error while evaluating locals. (while processing dev/ca-central-1/_global/route53-public)
ERRO[0014] exit status 1
```

Not sure how to do that. Even with debug logging enabled it appears that the logs are not in a deterministic or sequential order so it is difficult to infer what failed from the absence of its logs.

add shell completion for bash, zsh, and probably other shells as well.

If switching to `spf13/cobra` as CLI is an option I'd be easy to provide the completion out of the box: `rootCmd.GenBashCompletion(os.Stdout)`

@autero1 is this an option or too big for a change? On the other hand we could also quickly rebuild the structure of the `terragrunt` commands and generate the completion. The downside is that is has to be kept in sync with the code.

`urfave/cli` supports [bash completion](https://github.com/urfave/cli#bash-completion), but I think we will need something custom regardless of the underlying CLI library for this to work intuitively because of the way `terragrunt` works. E.g if you take a look at [how the commands are implemented](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/cli/cli_app.go#L163), we aren't defining them as direct commands in the cli struct. This is because we can't define all the available options for most of the commands, since they are passed through to `terraform`.

Additionally, we need to somehow merge the `terragrunt` completion with the `terraform` completions. Otherwise, you get completion for `terragrunt` specific commands like `plan-all`, but not for `terraform` commands that are not explicitly defined in `terragrunt`.

I started [the project](https://github.com/hanjunlee/terragrunt-oh-my-zsh-plugin) `oh-my-zsh` plugin of `terragrunt`. I have complete about zsh completion for `terraform` subcommands, options and resources (especially when you type `-target` option). But  I haven't complete all the options of `terragrunt` yet (only complete subcommand). 

I know It is not solution for this issue, just I hope it can help to someone who are using `oh-my-zsh`. Thanks.

Until this is implemented one can just set up terragrunt to at least complete terraform commands in bash by adding this line to ``.bashrc`` or ``.bash_aliases``:

``complete -C ~/.bin/terraform terragrunt``

Of course with the appropriate path to the terraform binary.

It also works fine with aliases:

```
alias tg='terragrunt'
complete -C ~/.bin/terraform tg
```

This didn't work for me. I've instead use this brute-force solution
In `.bashrc` or `.bash_aliases` add this:
```
complete -W "$(terragrunt | grep -A123 "COMMANDS" | head -n-7 | grep '^   ' | awk '{ print $1 }' | grep -v '*' | xargs)" terragrunt tg
```

# Terraagrunt Run-all is not processing external dependencies correctly

**laughtonsm** commented *Jul 19, 2021*

I am experiencing issues whilst trying to deploy a "Stack" using the `run-all` functionality  Details are as follows:

Terraform Version: 0.15.5
Terragrunt Version: 0.31.0

Behaviour:

Currently have external dependencies which are outside the current working directory.  When running `terragrunt run-all plan`, the path of the external dependency is correctly identified.  However, when proceeding with the plan, the current working director path is used, and the plan fails as the dependency is not found.  See below:

```
root@95ac24363805:/tg/test/pltfrm-tst-connectivity-001/uksouth# terragrunt run-all plan -terragrunt-include-external-dependencies
Module /tg/test/pltfrm-tst-connectivity-001/uksouth/key_vault_mgmt_hosts depends on module /tg/test/pltfrm-tst-management-001/uksouth/svc_central_logging, which is an external dependency outside of the current working directory. Should Terragrunt run this external dependency? Warning, if you say 'yes', Terragrunt will make changes in /tg/test/pltfrm-tst-management-001/uksouth/svc_central_logging as well! (y/n) y
ERRO[0011] Error processing module at '/tg/test/pltfrm-tst-connectivity-001/uksouth/svc_central_logging/terragrunt.hcl'. How this module was found: dependency of module at '/tg/test/pltfrm-tst-connectivity-001/uksouth/resource_group_mgmt_hosts'. Underlying error: Error reading file at path /tg/test/pltfrm-tst-connectivity-001/uksouth/svc_central_logging/terragrunt.hcl: open /tg/test/pltfrm-tst-connectivity-001/uksouth/svc_central_logging/terragrunt.hcl: no such file or directory
ERRO[0011] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1
root@95ac24363805:/tg/test/pltfrm-tst-connectivity-001/uksouth#
```

The external dependency has already been applied and has outputs

Wondering if this is actually expected behaviour or not

Hm, this does seem like a bug. Could you share how the `dependency` is defined in your `terragrunt.hcl`?

I am experiencing same behavior on `init` and `validate` subcommands of the `terragrunt run-all` command.
Debugging shows me that `-–terragrunt-include-external-dependencies` flag is consumed properly by Terragrunt, but as a buggy side-effect it also passes this as a flag of corresponding/underlying terraform command.

Some examples...

When I run:
```bash
TF_LOG=DEBUG terragrunt run-all init --terragrunt-log-level debug --terragrunt-debug --terragrunt-non-interactive -–terragrunt-include-external-dependencies
```

one of the debug lines shows this:

```txt
time=2021-09-14T15:46:11-07:00 level=debug msg=Running command: terraform init -backend-config=bucket=t<REDACTED> -backend-config=dynamodb_table=terraform-terragrunt-locks -backend-config=encrypt=true -backend-config=key=rds_faadb11/terraform.tfstate -backend-config=region=us-west-2 -backend-config=role_arn=arn:aws:iam::<REDACTED>:role/<REDACTED> -input=false -–terragrunt-include-external-dependencies prefix=[/Users/amer/dev/github/skywardio/infra-tf/infra/nonprod/rds_faadb11]
```
which being distilled to just terraform command is:
```bash
terraform init -backend-config=bucket=<REDACTED> -backend-config=dynamodb_table=terraform-terragrunt-locks -backend-config=encrypt=true -backend-config=key=rds_faadb11/terraform.tfstate -backend-config=region=us-west-2 -backend-config=role_arn=arn:aws:iam::<REDACTED>:role/<REDACTED> -input=false -–terragrunt-include-external-dependencies
```

@brikis98 ☝️ , I am hoping this helps with better understanding of the problem ...

Long story short, this prevents commands like `terragrunt run-all validate` with auto-init to run in CI/CD flows without human interaction to prompts and wanting to do init on all external dependencies. 
In our use-case, we ended up having new AWS EKS cluster as a new dependency to the module that pre-existed for long time. We don't have control of ordering of directories in CI/CD and parallelism involved to control which modules get init before others. Relying on `terragrunt run-all validate --terragrunt-non-interactive -–terragrunt-include-external-dependencies` was our best shot.

@brikis98 Any chance this bug is finally fixed and/or these flags are removed from the docs https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli-options/#terragrunt-ignore-external-dependencies ? What is the point of these flags if terraform command invoked by terragrunt will fail if we provide `-–terragrunt-include-external-dependencies` flag to terragrunt command?

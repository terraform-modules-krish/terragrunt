# terragrunt destroy 

**isurugiu** commented *Apr 24, 2023*

Hi,

Can we have `terragrunt destroy` or `terragrunt destroy --target=resource` behave in the same fashion as terraform?

The current behavior of `terragrunt destroy` is not quite self-explanatory or very well documented and given the sensitivity of the operation itself, it can be treated with more aplomb.

If I run `terragrunt destroy --target=resource` I'm getting a warning about dependent modules, which are not dependent at all to the current module in my case, it's practically every module in every environment that I have.

Another issue that deserves better attention is the documentation part that should include multiple scenarios about destroying and targeting single or multiple resources (terragrunt modules or other infra resources)

Thank you.

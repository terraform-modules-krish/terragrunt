# Terragrunt destroy hangs forever on component with dependency

**tkflexys** commented *Mar 14, 2023*

terragrunt version: 0.42.8 (also tested with latest and something as old as 0.39.1)
terraform version: 1.3.5

Structure
```
dependency_inputs.hcl
merged_inputs.hcl  
terragrunt.hcl
```

dependency_inputs.hcl
```
dependency "owner_account" {
  config_path = "${get_terragrunt_dir()}/../owner_account/"
}
inputs = {
  "sa-email": "${dependency.owner_account.outputs.sa-email}"
}
```

merged_inputs.hcl
```
include "dependency_inputs" {
  path =  "./dependency_inputs.hcl"
  merge_strategy = "deep"
}

```

terragrunt.hcl

```
locals {
  merged_inputs = read_terragrunt_config("./merged_inputs.hcl")
  state_config = {
    ....omitted
  }
}

#this is how local.merged_inputs is accessed
#not really relevant as tg still hangs if I remove this
inputs = merge(
  local.merged_inputs.inputs,
  ...ommitted
)

```
I ran it with debug and these are the few last lines of the output
```

```
For context, owner_account does not have any dependencies defined and I can run tg destroy just fine inside that component folder whereas the one inside the project folder which depends on owner_account fails

The second I comment out the line which calls `read_terragrunt_config` the execution seems to continue which seems like is the cause, I can run other commands like `init`, `plan`, and `apply` just fine with this setup

further investigation, if I make the following change the command doesn't hang but I am obviously asked for the broken dependency input now

dependency_inputs.hcl
```
dependency "owner_account" {
  config_path = "${get_terragrunt_dir()}/../owner_account/"
  skip_outputs = true
}
inputs = {
}
```

```

After running and investigating the code myself I've found the offending line

Did some more debugging and if I disable `CheckDependentModules`, the program no longer hangs
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/68120e20c750c6761d6f961cf8eae3399ce1d361/cli/cli_app.go#L373

after further investigation I found that the program freezes on this line https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/68120e20c750c6761d6f961cf8eae3399ce1d361/config/locals.go#L172

This happens when it checks for dependent modules and seems to hang when checking sub-dependencies i.e
`some_module > project > owner_account`
It stops when going over some_module

I've been trying to debug this all day and I found some strange behavior 

At the root of our project we have a `.git` folder, if I rename that folder to something else like `.notgit`, the problem almost goes away and only happens once every 10 times I run `terragrunt destroy`

The repo itself isn't very large:
```

```

I've created a project which with I can reproduce the problem 100% of the time
https://github.com/tkflexys/nothing

To get this to work you have to modify 2 files to configure a gcs project and bucket
Replace `redacted` with a valid project and bucket
https://github.com/tkflexys/nothing/blob/master/environments/dev/pentest/components/owner_account/terragrunt.hcl#L18
https://github.com/tkflexys/nothing/blob/master/environments/dev/pentest/components/project/terragrunt.hcl#L18

```
cd environments/dev/pentest/components/owner_account
terragrunt init
terragrunt apply
```
```
cd ../project
terragrunt init
terragrunt apply
```

```
terragrunt destroy --terragrunt-log-level=trace
```
This will hang so you can interrupt it after a few minutes
```

Hello,
thanks for the investigation, I will take a look into fix
***

**dod38fr** commented *Apr 7, 2023*

Here's a workaround:

- dump the inputs of the dependencies with `terragrunt render-json`
- extract the input values: `cat terragrunt_rendered.json | jq '.inputs' > inputs.json`
- copy this file `cp inputs.json .terragrunt-cache/...`
- go where the terraform files are generated: `cd .terragrunt-cache/...`
- run destroy `terraform destroy -var-file=inputs.json`

Hope this helps

Thanks a lot that was very helpful.

For anyone else that comes across this, we also had to collapse our list of inputs and instead opted in to pass them via TF_VAR variables

```
jq '.inputs' terragrunt_rendered.json > "inputs.json"
jq -r 'to_entries | .[] | select(.value | type != "object" and type != "array") | "TF_VAR_\(.key)=\(.value | @sh)"' "inputs.json" > env-vars
jq -r 'to_entries | .[] | select(.value | type == "object" or type == "array") | "TF_VAR_\(.key)=\(.value | @json | @sh)"' "inputs.json" >> env-vars

set -a
source env-vars
set +a
```

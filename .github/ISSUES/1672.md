# Question regarding dependency

**s1mark** commented *May 11, 2021*

### Scenario
* `module_a` depends `module_c`
* `module_b` depends `module_c`

### Question
Will `module_c` be invoked twice in case running `terragrunt run-all apply` ?

The same question would be for the `vpc` in the https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/execute-terraform-commands-on-multiple-modules-at-once/#dependencies-between-modules example

Aren't modules supposed to be idempotent (in which case it doesn't matter if its invoked twice or not)?

No, Terragrunt runs each module only once.

# Terragrunt caching info from GIT

**bab5470** commented *Feb 15, 2019*

Terragrunt seems to be caching my terraform scripts from GIT. Consequently each time I need to re-run `terragrunt apply` after changing my terraform scripts I need to first do `rm -r -f .terragrunt-cache/` certainly that's not by design? How do I tell terragrunt to stop using the local cache?

I'll answer my own question since I stumbled upon the answer:

Important gotcha: Terragrunt caching
The first time you set the source parameter to a remote URL, Terragrunt will download the code from that URL into a tmp folder. It will NOT download it again afterwords unless you change that URL. That’s because downloading code—and more importantly, reinitializing remote state, redownloading provider plugins, and redownloading modules—can take a long time. To avoid adding 10-90 seconds of overhead to every Terragrunt command, Terragrunt assumes all remote URLs are immutable, and only downloads them once.

Therefore, when working locally, you should use the --terragrunt-source parameter and point it at a local file path as described in the previous section. Terragrunt will copy the local files every time you run it, which is nearly instantaneous, and doesn’t require reinitializing everything, so you’ll be able to iterate quickly.

If you need to force Terragrunt to redownload something from a remote URL, run Terragrunt with the --terragrunt-source-update flag and it’ll delete the tmp folder, download the files from scratch, and reinitialize everything. This can take a while, so avoid it and use --terragrunt-source when you can!

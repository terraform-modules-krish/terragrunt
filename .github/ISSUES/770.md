# terragrunt s3 bucket creation fails when using root credentials

**mcalhoun** commented *Jul 1, 2019*

When using the root credentials from a newly created AWS account, the S3 bucket is created but the root user doesn't have permissions to the newly created bucket.

The issue is probably that we don't add a policy that grants the root-user access per the [troubleshooting guide].(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/troubleshoot_iam-s3.html)

Running the command as an IAM User with AdministratorAccess yields the expected result.

```
$ terragrunt init

i'm not sure this should be enabled by default, as it looks like it would overwrite existing bucket policies that people may have in place. Also, the aws document specifically says that for the root user to be denied, that there would be a bucket policy in place on the bucket that's not allowing it. Up until now, terragrunt has not been adding bucket policies to buckets it has created in my accounts.

nevermind, i see this only happens on bucket creation, so wouldn't overwrite

I agree and not making this the default behavior as working with root credentials is very very very bad practice and should not be supported in a default configuration. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#lock-away-credentials

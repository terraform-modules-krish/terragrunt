# Failed to upload state: AccessDenied (As root user)

**amontalban** commented *Feb 7, 2020*

Hi Terragrunt team,

I'm trying to use Terragrunt for a from scratch project I am doing and found out that I can't upload the state to the S3 bucket created with `terragrunt init`using the root account. I think it could be related to #770 and #978.

I'm using latest version:

```
$ terragrunt -version
terragrunt version v0.21.11
$ terraform -version
Terraform v0.12.19
+ provider.aws v2.48.0
```

Output of `terragrunt apply`:
```
module.iam_amontalban.aws_iam_user.this[0]: Creating...

Error: Failed to persist state to backend.                                                                                                                                                                                        
```

Policy in the S3 bucket created with Terragrunt:
```
$ aws-vault exec acme_root -- aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket acme-bucket
{
    "Policy": "{\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Sid\":\"RootAccess\",\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Principal\":{\"AWS\":\"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root\"},\"Action\":\"s3:*\",\"Resource\":\"arn:aws:s3:::acme-bucket\"}]}"
}
```

Current running user:
```
$ aws-vault exec acme_root -- aws sts get-caller-identity
{
    "UserId": "123456789012",
    "Account": "123456789012",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root"
}
```

Not even an `aws s3 cp` works:
```
$ aws-vault exec acme_root -- aws s3 cp variables.tf s3://acme-bucket --sse=aws:kms
upload failed: ./variables.tf to s3://acme-bucket/variables.tf An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the PutObject operation: Access Denied
```

Let me know if you need any other information.

Thanks!

Investigating this a little bit looks like the policy generated in #978 is wrong, it is:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "RootAccess",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root"
            },
            "Action": "s3:*",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::acme-bucket"
        }
    ]
}
```

When it should be like:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "RootAccess",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root"
            },
            "Action": "s3:*",
            "Resource": [
              "arn:aws:s3:::acme-bucket",
              "arn:aws:s3:::acme-bucket/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

After applying the above policy to the S3 bucket I was able to store the state.

Thanks for reporting! I think you may be right. Would you be up for a quick PR to fix this?

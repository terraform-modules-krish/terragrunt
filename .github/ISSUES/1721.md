# New include doesn't evaluate in locals block

Terraform version 0.14.11
Terragrunt version 0.30.4

First, thank you for this cool feature to access the include's atttributes!

But we have issues to use it in the child's `locals` block.

here is a dummy test code

`test/terragrunt.hcl`

```hcl
locals {
 environment = "test"
}
```

`test/child/terragrunt.hcl`

```hcl
include {
  path   = find_in_parent_folders()
  expose = true
}

locals {
  test = include.locals.environment
}

```

```bash
❯ cd test/child
❯ terragrunt validate --terragrunt-log-level trace
DEBU[0000] Found locals block: evaluating the expressions.
DEBU[0000] Found locals block: evaluating the expressions.
DEBU[0000] Evaluated 1 locals (remaining 0): environment
DEBU[0000] Evaluated 0 locals (remaining 1):
ERRO[0000] Not all locals could be evaluated:
ERRO[0000] 	- test
ERRO[0000] Could not evaluate all locals in block.
ERRO[0000] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1
```

It works if we use it in the `inputs` block directly.

# Create a built-in function to get the GCP project id

**bschaatsbergen** commented *Jul 10, 2022*

Similar to the existing AWS built-in functions (e.g. [get_aws_account_id()](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/built-in-functions/#get_aws_account_id), it would be nice to add some more GCP built-in functions. 

To start with, getting the GCP project ID. If I recall correctly [FindDefaultCredentials](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/oauth2/google#FindDefaultCredentials) returns [Credentials](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/oauth2/google#Credentials) which contains a `ProjectID`.

Proposed new built-in function: `get_gcp_project_id()`

@denis256, do you think it would be interesting and worth it if I create a PR to introduce both a skeleton for new GCP built-in functions, including the first function: `get_gcp_project_id()` ? I see and get a lot of questions from peers/colleagues about missing GCP built-in functions in Terragrunt. Would love to hear what you think and as I said, I'm happy to open a PR.

# Enhance evaluation of maps members within locals

**daniel-anova** commented *Sep 20, 2021*

When using the following code example:

```hcl
locals {
  values = {
    this = "this"

    // error: "Could not evaluate all locals in block."
    name     = local.values.this
    location = "eastus"
  }
}

terraform {
  source  = "tfr://registry.terraform.io/bcochofel/resource-group/azurerm?version=1.4.1"
}

generate "provider" {
  path      = "provider.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  contents  = <<EOF
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}
EOF
}

inputs = local.values
```

it produces the error "Could not evaluate all locals in block" when referencing a sub value of a map within the map itself. Moving that value outside the map works normally.

Could evaluation of maps within locals be evaluated in the same more "robust" way locals are evaluated to allow the above to work without error?

Alternatively could erros be clearer in pointing which block is failing to evaluate and why.

I'm not sure this is feasible given the parsing tools we have from the `hcl` library and the current approach. AFAIK, to implement this, we will need to overhaul the parsing mechanism to use a lazy evaluation approach like `terraform`, which is a major transition (not to mention more difficult to maintain).

I think we will consider a community PR to implement this, but will most likely not implement it ourselves.

Good point. Opened PR to enhance error message: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1819

Now the following will be logged for the following config:

_config_
```hcl
locals {
  hello = var.foo
  values = {
    this        = "this"
    name     = local.values.this
    location = "eastus"
  }
}
```

_error log_
```
ERRO[0000] Not all locals could be evaluated:
ERRO[0000]      - hello (Can't evalute expression at terragrunt.hcl:2,11-18 because of non-local variable reference (var is not defined))
ERRO[0000]      - values (Can't evalute expression at terragrunt.hcl:3,12-9,4 because local reference 'values' is not evaluated)
ERRO[0000] Could not evaluate all locals in block.
```

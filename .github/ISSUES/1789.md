# Using MFA with terragrunt 

**drey0143143** commented *Aug 26, 2021*

I am running my workflow using GitHub Actions and I need terragrunt to assume a role but to assume the role ,MFA is required. Please how can I dynamically configure terragrunt to authenticate (mfa) to assume the role.

MFA and automation don't typically go together. MFA devices are typically used by humans; machine users don't usually have multiple factors (e.g., an iPhone or key fob) to work with, right?

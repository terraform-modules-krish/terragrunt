# Unable to pass variables into my terragrunt.hcl file.

**devops-ameyer** commented *Jul 10, 2020*

I'm looking to dynamically update my terragrunt hcl file by passing in variables into the provider information and keys. Unfortunately that doesn't seem to work for me..
```remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
   generate = {
       path = "backend.tf"
       if_exists = "overwrite"
  }
  config = {
    bucket                  = "bucket"
    key                     = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
    region                  = "us-west-2"
    dynamodb_table          = "arm-terraform-state-lock"
    access_key              = "${var.tf_master_key}"
    secret_key              = "${var.tf_master_secret}"

  }
  generate = {
    path = "backend.tf"
    if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  }
}
generate "provider" {
  path = "provider.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  contents = <<EOF
provider "aws" {
  region                  = "${var.region}"
}
EOF
```

When running
 ```
terragrunt apply --auto-approve \
   -var env=$ENV_SUFFIX \ 
   -var tf_master_key=$TF_MASTER_ACCESS_KEY \
   -var tf_master_secret_key=$TM_MASTER_ACCOUNT_ACCESS_KEY_ID \
   -var region=$AWS_DEFAULT_REGION
```

I get a var. doesn't exist. Is there no way to pass in and replace these variables?

Unfortunately, Terragrunt doesn't support variables, as the main purpose of terragrunt is to set variables for terraform.

With that said, you can get something similar by using the [get_env](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/built-in-functions/#get_env) function and environment variables.

Hi @yorinasub17, do we still have same limitation? We have a case where we need to substitute terraform variables in the generate block but it looks like it is not working? We true the get_env as well in generate block and it didn't work. Could you plz advise?

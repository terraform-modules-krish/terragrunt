# Terragrunt 0.38 stop to work on MacOS

**headincl0ud** commented *Jun 19, 2022*

Hi, 

After upgrade to the latest version, Terragrunt stopped to work on MacOS system. 

MacOS:

```
Software:

    System Software Overview:

      System Version: macOS 12.2.1
      Kernel Version: Darwin 21.3.0
      Boot Volume: Macintosh HD
      Boot Mode: Normal
```

Command:

```
terragrunt run-all plan \
--terragrunt-parallelism 20 \
-out=output.tfplan \
-lock=false \
--terragrunt-log-level 'debug'
```

The execution is frozen without any timeout.
Last debug log:

```
DEBU[0000] Downloading Terraform configurations from file:///Users/XXX into /Users/.../Desktop/XXX/.terragrunt-cache/XadJ1VVixKGR417QLsj7aA9L_b4/8XKxA4zAV2Un76BgXSSZ3n23TSQ  prefix=[/Users/.../Desk
top/XXX]
```

TF:
```
Terraform v1.2.3
on darwin_amd64
```

Terragrunt:
```
terragrunt version v0.38.0                                                                                                                                         14h28m ✖ ◒

```

Returning to the previous version (0.37.4) fixed the issue. 

Let me know what types of details you need.

Hi,
will be helpful to provide more logs when this issue happens,
I tried on my environments with darwin_amd64 and arm64 using [test project](https://github.com/denis256/terragrunt-tests/tree/master/terragrunt-init-each-time) and it worked fine

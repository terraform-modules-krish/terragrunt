# Chocolatey (Choco) package is outdated

**Hayorti** commented *Feb 14, 2020*

The Chocolatey package at https://chocolatey.org/packages/terragrunt is for version 0.21.9 and is outdated.

A contributor created the package and submitted issue #862 and the documentation was changed through PR #865 , but the package hasn't been maintained consistently.

Considering that Gruntwork.io won't be maintaining packages as noted in #717 , I think it should either be noted in the [official installation documentation](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/getting-started/install/) that the Choco packages aren't officially maintained so that people don't think that the version they're installing is actually current or official. I'd even consider removing Chocolatey as a primary method of installation for Windows and maybe including it as an alternative.

I, for one, only realized that the package was outdated when I went to check Terragrunt's release history since I know that Chocolatey packages aren't always maintained or up-to-date.

FWIW, we already indicate this in [the docs](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/getting-started/install/#install-terragrunt)

> Note that third-party Terragrunt packages may not be updated with the latest version, but are often close. Please check your version against the latest available on the Releases Page.

We could probably do a better job to indicate that all the different package managers are third party, and that the only first party installation is manual install via the releases page.

Yeah, I think that would be fair to the end-users. Realistically, unless someone were to dig up issue #862 , they wouldn't have any way of knowing that DrFaust (the choco package maintainer) isn't part of the Terragrunt team and that the package is in fact third-party.

I'd go so far as to move the manual installation to the top of the documentation and flag it as the recommended method.

Agreed! I'd list manual install (perhaps renamed to "download from releases page") as option #1... Then list the caveat about package managers being a bit out of date more clearly below that... And then list all the package manager install options.

Anyone up for a quick PR to make this change?

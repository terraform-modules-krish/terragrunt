# Feature request: get_original_path_from_repo_root function

**askoriy** commented *May 4, 2022*

**TL.DR.**: I would like to have the function that works differently to `get_path_from_repo_root`
the same as `get_original_terragrunt_dir` works differently to `get_terragrunt_dir`.

-----

Suppose there is a repo with file structure:
```
.
├── project.hcl
├── environment1
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
└── environment2
    └── terragrunt.hcl

# project.hcl
locals {
  default_aws_tags = {
    repo_path = get_path_from_repo_root()
    abs_root_path = get_terragrunt_dir()
    abs_env_path = get_original_terragrunt_dir()
  }
}

# terragrunt.hcl
locals {
  project_vars = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("project.hcl"))
}

inputs = merge(
  local.project_vars.locals,
  {# some other inputs}
)
```

`get_path_from_repo_root()` will return `.` in both environments, but I need some function to return the correct path from original calling directory, not a directory in which the function is used.

Using `get_original_terragrunt_dir()` will return absolute path of environment directory, unlike `get_terragrunt_dir()` will return absolute path of repo's root.


As a workaround I currenlty used a trick:
`repo_path = replace(get_original_terragrunt_dir(), get_parent_terragrunt_dir(), get_path_from_repo_root())`
that works not exactly the same in all cases.

Hi,
I was wondering if can be used `repo_path = run_cmd("pwd")` to get exact path to directory

It will return absolute path, but I want to have a related path from the repo root to the calling module

# Sub-Module dependencies for data source

**tleibovichverint** commented *Aug 4, 2022*

I want to use Terragrunt to deploy this example:  https://github.com/aws-ia/terraform-aws-eks-blueprints/blob/main/examples/complete-kubernetes-addons/main.tf

So far, I was able to create the VPC/EKS resource without a problem, I separated each module into a different module directory, and everything worked as expected.

When I tried to do the same for the `Kubernetes-addons` module, I faced an issue with the data source trying to call to the cluster and failing since the cluster wasn't created at this point.

Here's my `terragrunt.hcl` which I'm trying to execute `run-all plan` with this specific module:
```hcl
...
terraform { 
  source = "git::git@github.com:aws-ia/terraform-aws-eks-blueprints.git//modules/kubernetes-addons?ref=v4.6.1"
}

locals {
  # Extract needed variables for reuse
  cluster_version = "${include.envcommon.locals.cluster_version}"
  name =  "${include.envcommon.locals.name}"

}
dependency "eks" {
  config_path = "../eks"

  mock_outputs = {
    eks_cluster_endpoint = "https://000000000000.gr7.eu-west-3.eks.amazonaws.com"
    eks_oidc_provider = "something"
    eks_cluster_id = "something"
  }
}
inputs = {
  eks_cluster_id = dependency.eks.outputs.cluster_id
  eks_cluster_endpoint = dependency.eks.outputs.eks_cluster_endpoint
  eks_oidc_provider = dependency.eks.outputs.eks_oidc_provider
  eks_cluster_version = local.cluster_version
...
}
```

The error that I'm getting here:  
`

    INFO[0035]
      Error: error reading EKS Cluster (something): couldn't find resource
       with data.aws_eks_cluster.eks_cluster,
        on data.tf line 7, in data "aws_eks_cluster" "eks_cluster":
          7: data "aws_eks_cluster" "eks_cluster" {

`

If I run it directly from the example, `terraform plan` worked as expected.
Any idea how to workaround this issue?

Hi,
most probably during the execution of `run-all plan` mock output is passed to the terraform code and it fails trying to read cluster details from provided data...

To avoid this situation, if possible, can be provided valid mock outputs to not break plan execution, not sure if it is possible in this case since it is expected to have already deployed EKS cluster

good point, 
but if I would like to create everything from scratch with terragrunt dependencies. Is it possible?
For example:
1. network
2. EKS cluster 
3. helm charts

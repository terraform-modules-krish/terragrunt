# Terragrunt version 0.28.7 does not work with Terraform 0.14.7 (Initialization required)

**chris1248** commented *Mar 8, 2021*

I am trying to run terragrunt plan, but when I do I get a very unhelpful error:

`Error: Initialization required. Please see the error message above.`

The full command:

`terragrunt plan --terragrunt-log-level debug --terragrunt-debug --terragrunt-working-dir working_dir`

And the full output:

```

@chris1248 Could you provide more info on your Terragrunt configurations?

@yorinasub17 Could this be related to https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.28.3 (https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1533)?

**yorinasub17** commented *Mar 9, 2021*

Yes this looks like it is related.

@chris1248 (**assuming you have `remote_state` configured**) could you try wiping `.terragrunt-cache` from the `/bla bla bla` folder (the module targeted by `dependency`) and see if the error message changes?

Separately, was this an existing config that you upgraded to tf 0.14, or completely brand new?

Just ran into this myself and it does appear to be due to an optimization, but not the one made in `v0.28.3` and clearing the `.terragrunt-cache` doesn't solve it (actually was quite the head scratcher at first because everything worked locally where each module was already initialized, but the error showed up in CI, and eventually I managed to reproduce locally by clearing the `.terragrunt-cache` directories to test with the same clean state you'd have in a CI build)

Setting `disable_dependency_optimization = true` seems to be an effective workaround, which runs succesuflly albeit with a couple warnings about falling back to using `terragrunt output` which is likely why it works since in such a case the init in dependencies would be implied by running the output command.

```

```

The issue is reproducible all the way back to `v0.23.38` (the only thing in this release was #1321). The issue cannot be reproduced in `v0.23.37`. Here is what I was doing to test each version stepping back to where it stopped breaking:

```
version=v0.23.37
wget https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/download/$version/terragrunt_darwin_amd64
mv terragrunt_darwin_amd64 /tmp/terragrunt-$version
chmod +x /tmp/terragrunt-$version

find . -type d -name .terragrunt-cache -exec rm -rf {} +
(cd live/traefik; /tmp/terragrunt-$version init)
```

For now I'm going to set `disable_dependency_optimization` in my config so it doesn't become a blocker for me.

My directory tree looks like this:

```
├── common_vars.hcl
├── live
│   ├── cluster
│   │   └── terragrunt.hcl

DEBU[0001] Usage: terraform [global options] init [options]

  Initialize a new or existing Terraform working directory by creating
  initial files, loading any remote state, downloading modules, etc.

  This is the first command that should be run for any new or existing
  Terraform configuration per machine. This sets up all the local data
  necessary to run Terraform that is typically not committed to version
  control.

  This command is always safe to run multiple times. Though subsequent runs
  may give errors, this command will never delete your configuration or
  state. Even so, if you have important information, please back it up prior
  to running this command, just in case.

Options:

  -backend=true        Configure the backend for this configuration.

  -backend-config=path This can be either a path to an HCL file with key/value
                       assignments (same format as terraform.tfvars) or a
                       'key=value' format. This is merged with what is in the
                       configuration file. This can be specified multiple
                       times. The backend type must be in the configuration
                       itself.

  -force-copy          Suppress prompts about copying state data. This is
                       equivalent to providing a "yes" to all confirmation
                       prompts.

  -from-module=SOURCE  Copy the contents of the given module into the target
                       directory before initialization.

  -get=true            Download any modules for this configuration.

  -input=true          Ask for input if necessary. If false, will error if
                       input was required.

  -no-color            If specified, output won't contain any color.

  -plugin-dir          Directory containing plugin binaries. This overrides all
                       default search paths for plugins, and prevents the
                       automatic installation of plugins. This flag can be used
                       multiple times.

  -reconfigure         Reconfigure the backend, ignoring any saved
                       configuration.

  -upgrade=false       If installing modules (-get) or plugins, ignore
                       previously-downloaded objects and install the
                       latest version allowed within configured constraints.

  -lockfile=MODE       Set a dependency lockfile mode.

  necessary to run Terraform that is typically not committed to version
  control.

  This command is always safe to run multiple times. Though subsequent runs
  may give errors, this command will never delete your configuration or
  state. Even so, if you have important information, please back it up prior
  to running this command, just in case.

Options:

  -backend=true        Configure the backend for this configuration.

  -backend-config=path This can be either a path to an HCL file with key/value
                       assignments (same format as terraform.tfvars) or a
                       'key=value' format. This is merged with what is in the
                       configuration file. This can be specified multiple
                       times. The backend type must be in the configuration
                       itself.

  -force-copy          Suppress prompts about copying state data. This is
                       equivalent to providing a "yes" to all confirmation
                       prompts.

  -from-module=SOURCE  Copy the contents of the given module into the target
                       directory before initialization.

  -get=true            Download any modules for this configuration.

  -input=true          Ask for input if necessary. If false, will error if
                       input was required.

  -no-color            If specified, output won't contain any color.

  -plugin-dir          Directory containing plugin binaries. This overrides all
                       default search paths for plugins, and prevents the
                       automatic installation of plugins. This flag can be used
                       multiple times.

  -reconfigure         Reconfigure the backend, ignoring any saved
                       configuration.

  -upgrade=false       If installing modules (-get) or plugins, ignore
                       previously-downloaded objects and install the
                       latest version allowed within configured constraints.

  -lockfile=MODE       Set a dependency lockfile mode.

I always wipe the terragrunt cache directory but it doesn't matter. I solved this by reverting to an older version of terragrunt. Sorry guys, new stuff has wierd bugs, we don't use it.

@yorinasub17 @brikis98 I think what I'm finding points to possibly needing to simply revert the optimization from #1321, at the very least remove the use of `-get-plugins=false` which is what's causing the error. As can be seen from my trace, the `terraform init` call is printing a help message, not an error or warning which is being ignored as an "expected error from dependency init call" despite the error being that an invalid flag is being passed.

From the changelog for Terraform v014.3:

> terraform init: setting -get-plugins to false will now cause a warning, as this flag has been a no-op since 0.13.0 and usage is better served through using provider_installation blocks (#27092)

From the changelog for Terraform v0.15.0-beta1:

> The -get-plugins=false option is no longer available on terraform init. (Terraform now always installs plugins.) (#27463)

With `-get-plugins` being a no-op since 0.13.0, it's a bit befuddling why it was added as an optimization circa August 2020, but it was, oh well, and now it's breaking things since the flag is straight up gone. This does lead me to make an additional observation worth mentioning: _Upon further inspection of the trace from the OP here, the original issue encountered may be different than the one in my trace as I was running `0.15.0-beta2` when I encountered it, and @chris1248 indicated it broke with 0.14.7 where the flag, although it doesn't do anything, still actually exists and shouldn't trigger the issue shown in my similar but different trace._

I haven't attempted running tests, but building Terragrunt to include the changes in https://github.com/davidalger/terragrunt/commit/cb125214a97481a51170461965d633e9d1f58809 resolves the issue I was having at least (doing more testing, and going to try and run the test suite before submitting a PR for this one). Given my further discovery efforts, I doubt it resolves the OPs, and that issue may indeed be related to the work in #1533 idk.

Please give https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.28.17 a shot (new binaries should show up in the next few minutes). Thanks to @davidalger's PR, I believe that should fix the issue.

I have tested out version 0.28.17 with three different versions of terraform:
0.12.28 - it works
0.14.7 - it works
0.14.9 - it works

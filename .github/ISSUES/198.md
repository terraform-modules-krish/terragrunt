# plan-all swallows error when it can't acquire a lock

**mrtyler** commented *Apr 28, 2017*

I don't have a canned minimal repro case but hopefully it's simple enough: in two separate checkouts of a terraform project with locking enabled, run `terragrunt plan-all` simultaneously.

Here's what happens to the `plan-all` that loses the race:
```
[terragrunt] [/Users/tyler/demo/gpii-terraform-live/stg/base] 2017/04/27 19:21:56 Running command: terraform plan
Acquiring state lock. This may take a few moments...
[terragrunt] [/Users/tyler/demo/gpii-terraform-live/stg/base] 2017/04/27 19:22:00 Module /Users/tyler/demo/gpii-terraform-live/stg/base has finished with an error: exit status 1
[terragrunt] [/Users/tyler/demo/gpii-terraform-live/stg/worker] 2017/04/27 19:22:00 Dependency /Users/tyler/demo/gpii-terraform-live/stg/base of module /Users/tyler/demo/gpii-terraform-live/stg/worker just finished with an error. Module /Users/tyler/demo/gpii-terraform-live/stg/worker will have to return an error too.
```
`exit status 1` but no explanation of what went wrong.

`terragrunt plan` produces a clear error message in the same situation:
```
[terragrunt] 2017/04/27 19:26:10 Running command: terraform plan
Acquiring state lock. This may take a few moments...

`apply-all` does as well:

```

I always use the -lock-timeout as described in the documentation to avoid that kind of conflict. I will try it without.

What version are you using?

I am working on a new feature with clean output when using -all commands. I don't have the problem with that version.

  Info:


Terraform acquires a state lock to protect the state from being written
by multiple users at the same time. Please resolve the issue above and try
again. For most commands, you can disable locking with the "-lock=false"
flag, but this is not recommended.

I plan to add that via `extra_args` as part of my migration from terraform 0.8.x to 0.9.x. I found the reported locking issue without `-lock-timeout` while in the middle of that migration.

> What version are you using?

* terragrunt version v0.12.13
* Terraform v0.9.4

I tried rolling back to terraform 0.9.3 -- same failure case.

I saw your PR and I am excited for this feature üëç

It seems `plan-all` swallows errors in general. I mistakenly made a typo in a resource attribute and all I got was:

```
Module xxx has finished with an error: exit status 1
```

Looking forward to #199 being merged too.

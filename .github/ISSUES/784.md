# GCS bucket not being created

**infa-bsurber** commented *Jul 12, 2019*

terragrunt version v0.18.7 and terraform version v0.11.14 (can't upgrade to 0.12 until the Vault provider supports it)

config files:
at env/terraform.tfvars
```
terragrunt = {
  remote_state {
    backend = "gcs"
    config {
      project = "<redacted>"
      bucket = "<redacted>"
      prefix = "${path_relative_to_include()}"
    }
  }
}
```
at env/region/terraform.tfvars
```
terragrunt {
  terraform {
    source = "${get_tfvars_dir()}/../../../../templates"
  }
  # include gcs bucket state storage configuration
  include {
    path = "../terraform.tfvars"
  }
}
```
I'm getting the following unexpected error: 
```
Initializing the backend...

Successfully configured the backend "gcs"! Terraform will automatically
use this backend unless the backend configuration changes.
Failed to get existing workspaces: querying Cloud Storage failed: storage: bucket doesn't exist   
```

This error is unexpected as terragrunt documentation indicates that the gcs bucket should get automatically created on the first run.

Any ideas? Bug? Misconfiguration?

Hi, the GCS bucket auto creation was introduced in [v0.19.6](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.19.6). If you look at [the README for the version you are using](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/tree/v0.18.7), the GCS bucket creation isn't mentioned there.

Ah, makes sense, thanks for the quick response. I'll add a quick .tf file & use the terraform cli to handle bucket creation beforehand then.

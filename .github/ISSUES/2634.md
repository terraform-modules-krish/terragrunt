**Describe the bug**

templatefile fails on map using knoweledge base article suggestions.

**To Reproduce**

when copying the above code.. from https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1443

If you pass a set or a list to the templatefile it works, but maps do not..

```hcl
code in issue mentioned above.

More testing... Template renders with following template:

%{ for k, v in child_accounts }
${k}
%{ endfor }

does not work with this template:

%{ for k, v in child_accounts }
${k} ${v}
%{ endfor }
```

**Expected behavior**
I would expect template files to get rendered.

**Nice to have**
- [x] Terminal output
```
ERRO[0000] terragrunt.hcl:146,14-27: Error in function call; Call to function "templatefile" failed: _generated_providers.tmpl:2,8-9: Invalid template interpolation value; Cannot include the given value in a string template: string required., and 4 other diagnostic(s)., and 1 other diagnostic(s)
```

- [ ] Screenshots

**Versions**
- Terragrunt version: 0.48.1
- Terraform version: 1.5.2
- Environment details (Ubuntu 20.04, Windows 10, etc.): m2 mac

**Additional context**
Trying to build multiple providers using generate and templates. Additionally i thought maybe the template file had to be on the module side... that is not the case heh.

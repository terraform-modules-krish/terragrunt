# brew receipe for terragrunt@0.18

**ebarault** commented *Oct 2, 2019*

Hi @brikis98,

Terraform publishes 2 different receipes of terraform to homebrew: terraform and terraform@0.11.

What do you think of publishing a terragrunt@0.18 version to homebrew in order to ease working at the same time with both terraform/terragrunt combinations?

Homebrew does not support packaging versions that are no longer actively maintained, and we don't really have an intention to support it going forward. See the discussion in https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/43337.

With that said, you can use the approach described here (https://blog.gruntwork.io/installing-multiple-versions-of-terraform-with-homebrew-899f6d124ff9) for managing multiple versions of terragrunt, or [tgenv](https://github.com/cunymatthieu/tgenv).

I see...
Well of course I came up with my solution to have both latest terragrunt/terraform releases as well as fixed terragrunt@0.18/terraform@0.11 legacy releases.
I just find a bit of a shame that having a terraform@0.11 recipe in Homebrew, we don't have a terragrunt@0.18 version to ease the install while big projects are being migrated.

Because after all, what is "active support" of a wrapping tool that will have no additional features and is fixed to a specific release of terraform? 

Someone could as well have answered that there was a will to provide support and the recipe might be in Homebrew now. 

I did contribute a few PRs and discussions here and I fully grasp the meaning of "community help required". We are a lot to use Terragrunt along with terraform and I'd been willing to help for the sake of having a formula.

Anyway, no big deal though. Nothing prevents anyone to install any version of terragrunt without the need for Homebrew ðŸ˜„.

Thanks for taking the time to respond, we'll continue our path with tiny wrappers over tiny wrappers.

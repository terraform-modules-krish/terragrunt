# Use outputs of module in a state of creating

**kderck** commented *Aug 11, 2022*

Hi - We use the `terraform-modules` for `aws-s3`. We have created a logging bucket which contains logs. However we would like to enable s3 logging for the logging bucket. Normally when we need an output from terragrunt we use `dependency.dns.outputs...` However this module references itself and this works because the `s3 bucket resource` is created before the `s3 bucket logging resource` Is there a way to use outputs from the module even when all resources have not been created...


```hcl
terraform {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/s3-bucket/aws"
}
```

```hcl
inputs = {
  logging = {
    target_bucket = ... 
    target_prefix = "log/"
  }
}
```

> Please see [terraform-aws-s3-bucket](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-s3-bucket/blob/c859215e6aa7f9d5ee35d89256476e7e681f7306/examples/complete/main.tf#L151) for an example.

Hi,
AFAIK this is not supported, it may be workarounded by extraction of bucket configuration to a different module

I've a similar use case with eks module but my problem is kinda messier that both modules rely on eachother on some variables, The irsa module rely on eks's oidc_provider_arn and eks module's addon rely on the iam_role_arn (the [example](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-eks/blob/master/docs/irsa_integration.md) that I want to import). It would be great to add this feature.

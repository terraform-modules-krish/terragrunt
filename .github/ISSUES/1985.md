# "run-all" enhancement: group output by module

**max-rocket-internet** commented *Jan 18, 2022*

For some applications we have 20+ modules where we would run a `plan`, for example like this:

```
 terragrunt run-all plan --terragrunt-parallelism 4 --terragrunt-include-dir "*/*/my-app/"
```

The problem is that the output from this is not grouped or sorted in any way I can see. So when there is an unexpected change in the output of this command, unless there's something really specific in the change to tell me what module it comes from, it's hard to tell what/where the change is for. Especially when all modules have very similar resources/naming.

Would it be possible to do one of these?

1. Prepend all lines with the module name/path
2. Buffer and group the output per module and print later
3. Colourise the output to identify each module
4. Something I can't think of

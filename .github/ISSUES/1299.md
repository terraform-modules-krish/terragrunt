# Error occuring when trying to run `init` with Terraform 0.13

**cwoolum** commented *Aug 14, 2020*

When I try to run init with 0.13, it is unable to restore the providers. From the errors, it seems to be a relative path issue. This is on windows. My Linux env is borked right now so I'm unable to test there.

Everything is working correctly in a pure Terraform environment.

terragrunt version `v0.23.32`

I think this is running into the long path issue. There is a suggested fix here: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/581#issuecomment-460051767

Also had this problem, fought with it for hours, and it was the Windows path length limitation.  Check out Issue #581 for workarounds.

Closing as duplicate of #581.

# Access Denied with restricted S3 permissions

**engineertdog** commented *Nov 11, 2022*

Utilizing the [AWS Auth](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/aws-auth/) documentation, I have the IAM policy at the end of this post. When using this policy, the following error is received:

`level=error msg=AccessDenied: Access Denied`

This is only fixed by allowing `s3:*` on the bucket policy rule (not the state file policy rule). However, I'm unable to determine what the missing s3 permissions are.

```json
{
  "Sid": "DynamoDBState",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "dynamodb:DescribeTable",
    "dynamodb:GetItem",
    "dynamodb:PutItem",
    "dynamodb:DeleteItem",
    "dynamodb:CreateTable"
  ],
  "Resource": [
    "arn:aws:dynamodb:*:*:table/TABLE_NAME"
  ]
},
{
  "Sid": "S3State",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "s3:ListBucket",
    "s3:GetBucketVersioning",
    "s3:GetObject",
    "s3:GetBucketAcl",
    "s3:GetBucketLogging",
    "s3:CreateBucket",
    "s3:PutObject",
    "s3:PutBucketPublicAccessBlock",
    "s3:PutBucketTagging",
    "s3:PutBucketPolicy",
    "s3:PutBucketVersioning",
    "s3:PutEncryptionConfiguration",
    "s3:PutBucketAcl",
    "s3:PutBucketLogging"
  ],
  "Resource": [
    "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME"
  ]
},
{
  "Sid": "S3StateFile",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "s3:PutObject",
    "s3:GetObject"
  ],
  "Resource": [
    "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME/some/path/here"
  ]
}
```

Hello,
AFAIK, additionally will be required to set:
```
"s3:GetEncryptionConfiguration",
"s3:GetBucketPolicy",
"s3:GetBucketPublicAccessBlock",
"s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration"
```

I appreciate the missing permissions. That worked as expected!

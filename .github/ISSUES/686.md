# Terragrunt fails to load some modules on Windows 10

**genert** commented *Mar 20, 2019*

There seems to be problem with path resolving on Windows 10.

When executing terragrunt plan for instance, the terraform initializing fails with following reason:

```

```

Although the file does EXIST within terragrunt-cache folder.

Is there any difference on Windows vs UNIX how paths are resolved?

Latest and greatest Terraform and Terragrunt versions are used.

@Genert Might be related to long filepaths on Windows. See workaround using TERRAGRUNT_DOWNLOAD to shorten the paths... https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/581#issuecomment-460051767

Thanks a bunch for the workarounds - it was definitely a long file path issue, we got a bit further with the TERRAGRUNT_DOWNLOAD workaround (though still chanced upon too long paths in the end) but actually got stuff working via Ubuntu and WSL.

In case of similar error, the problem seems to be Windows platform specific.

Nothing much to do at the moment as far from this https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/581#issuecomment-460051767

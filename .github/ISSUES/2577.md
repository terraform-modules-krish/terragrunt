# S3 State Bucket Root Policy Updates

**mikegrima** commented *May 23, 2023*

Hello:

EDIT: This only affects deny policies. Allow policies on the account root is lint and does nothing, so it's not harmful to have on the bucket policy, but doesn't help the policy either.

AWS has sent out notices to their customers that S3 bucket policies permitting the same-account root account principal: `arn:aws:iam::BUCKET-OWNING-ACCOUNT:root` will have a logic change with serious security impacts. Before June 2023, this policy is a no-op. It has no effect as the `root` principal of the account has full access to all resources within it, and IAM on the account has the authority to delegate access to the buckets via Roles, Users, Managed Policies, and Groups.

After June of 2023, the policy change *will apply to all IAM Principals in that account instead of applying to only the account's root identity*.

This means that any S3 bucket with the same/bucket-owning account root ARN principal will **be accessible by any and all IAM principals in the AWS account that the S3 bucket resides in!**

**This affects the state S3 bucket!** The code here will place this policy on the state bucket:
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/a9df21fae6041de444a3a66154f7ccda97548ba4/remote/remote_state_s3.go#L834-L909

Unfortunately, AWS has not documented this publicly, but the email that many customers are receiving looks like this:

> Hello,
> 
> Amazon S3 is updating its bucket policy evaluation to make it consistent with how similar policies are evaluated across AWS. If you have a statement in one of your bucket policies whose principal refers to the account that owns the bucket, *this statement will now apply to all IAM Principals in that account instead of applying to only the account's root identity*. This update will affect buckets in at least one of your AWS accounts. This update will be rolled out in all AWS Regions in June, 2023. 
> 
> We are requesting that you review your bucket policies and access patterns, and update your bucket policies before June, 2023, to ensure that they correctly reflect your expected access patterns in S3.

> A list of your S3 buckets in the US-EAST-2 Region which will be affected by the update to bucket authorization, is available in the 'Affected resources' tab.

> Currently, for the previously listed buckets, S3 applies this statement only to requests made by the bucket-owning account's root identity, and not to IAM Principals within the bucket-owning account. The authorization behavior update will make S3 consistent with policy evaluation in other AWS services. With this update, the previous statement applies to all IAM Principals in the bucket-owning account.

> The following recommendations will work both with the current and updated authorization behavior in S3, and therefore you can implement them today. We strongly recommend testing them on a test bucket before putting them on a bucket that serves a production workload.

> Important: Avoiding S3 bucket lockout
> 
> A Deny statement in an S3 bucket policy that is unintentionally overly broad can result in Access Denied errors for all users in the account, including actions such as s3:PutBucketPolicy that might be needed to remediate the accidentally-broad statement.  Because the s3:PutBucketPolicy action can be taken only by IAM Principals within the same account as the bucket, and never by external accounts, it is not necessary to deny access to this action outside the account. However, it is possible to deny this action within the same account, and when that is applied overly broadly, bucket lockout can occur. 
> 
> You can remediate bucket-lockout situations by signing in with your account's root identity and updating the bucket policy.
> 
> To avoid this situation in the first place, we recommend as a best practice that you avoid using Deny statements that cover all S3 actions (s3:* ) on the bucket resource (arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket). While these statements will work as desired when the Conditions elements are correctly configured, a mistake in specifying those Conditions will result in a full lockout. In particular, a statement such as the following one will prevent all further changes to the S3 bucket's policy except by the account's root identity.

> Furthermore, S3 recommends against the use of the NotPrincipal element in IAM statements. Most common permission scenarios can be implemented more straightforwardly with conditions, as detailed in the previous examples. For more information on the 'NotPrincipal' element, please refer the IAM documentation page [1].

> It is not correct to use 'aws:SourceAccount' or 'aws:SourceArn' to achieve this goal. These IAM values are used for a different use case, such as, one in which an AWS service is accessing your bucket. For limiting access to specific IAM Principals, we recommend using the 'aws:PrincipalArn' condition. Please refer the documentation on all IAM global conditions, including the above [3].

These locations might be public IPv4 address ranges, if using the general public endpoint of the S3 service, or particular Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), when reaching S3 by way of a VPC Endpoint.

>     - Note the specific s3:ListBucket action; had the action instead been a generic s3:*, this policy would also have denied all actions on the bucket from outside those network paths, which can be undesired. For example, the ability to make further changes to bucket policy. See the previous discussion on avoiding bucket lockout.

> 3) Scenario: Blocking unencrypted uploads: 
> 
> S3 offers a "default encryption" option for buckets that allow a customer to designate a desired Server-Side Encryption (SSE) scheme, either SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS. Because individual PutObject requests in S3 can specify schemes different from the bucket default, a common scenario for customers who want to be certain that no unencrypted data can be uploaded is to write an S3 bucket policy that blocks s3:PutObject from succeeding, unless the desired SSE scheme will be used for the object.

> Other common patterns: The condition s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption can be used for a more generic permission statement to require SSE-S3 (AES256) or SSE-KMS (aws:kms) respectively. A few other example policies for encryption are available in our Knowledge Center article [4].
> 
> Although the aws:PrincipalAccount IAM condition can be used to limit the effect of these policy statements to particular AWS accounts, that is usually unnecessary for the common case in which you are simply trying to assert that all data that gets written is encrypted in the desired way.

We have gone through and internally removed these policies from all of our S3 buckets. However, doing this will result in the following notice from Terragrunt:

```hcl
 terragrunt apply
WARN[0002] The remote state S3 bucket THE-STATE-BUCKET needs to be updated:  prefix=[/some/path/] 
WARN[0002]   - Bucket Root Access                        prefix=[/some/path/] 
Remote state S3 bucket THE-STATE-BUCKET is out of date. Would you like Terragrunt to update it? (y/n) n
```

The code for adding the same-account root access should be removed.

**Versions**
- Terragrunt version: v0.45.11
- Terraform version: v1.4.6
- Environment details (Ubuntu 20.04, Windows 10, etc.): macOS Ventura

To remove S3 bucket root policy, set `skip_bucket_root_access=true` under the [remote state config](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#:~:text=skip_bucket_root_access).

**mikegrima** commented *May 25, 2023*

In either case, terragrunt should not attempt to add this policy in.

**mikegrima** commented *May 31, 2023*

Just chatted with the S3 team about this and apparently, their S3 bucket policy change logic is ONLY affecting DENY policies and NOT allow policies. As such, this is not a security problem, but is lint on the policy. 

Permitting the account root is a noop and doesn't actually do anything. Thus, this is low priority.

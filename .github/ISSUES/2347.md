# ability to cache `run_cmd` ignoring current directory

**tjstansell** commented *Nov 1, 2022*

I've been exploring slow startup times for terragrunt and one of the things I found was our use of `run_cmd` to look up an AWS account id from a name.  It queries AWS Organizations and caches that as a local .json output that subsequent runs will use, so only the first call hits AWS.  But even just this causes terragrunt to take an extra 20 seconds to startup just because of the overhead of `run_cmd` and the number of times it gets called.

terragrunt already has a cache for `run_cmd` but since the key is based on the cmd+directory, we do not get any benefit from that.  Perhaps if there was a way to flag the `run_cmd` output as not reliant on the directory, it could be cached using the same caching mechanism with an empty directory for the key.  This would let me then be able to load an account map with:

```hcl
locals {
    account_map = jsondecode(run_cmd("--terragrunt-global-cache", "/usr/local/bin/get-account-map"))
}
```

and it would only run that command the first time, regardless of which directory the hcl is being parsed in.  Every subsequent one would just come out of the cache.

I just noticed this is basically the same as #2184.  Feel free to close as a duplicate or whatever.

As a proof of concept, I modified terragrunt to support `run_cmd` looking for a `--terragrunt-global-cache` as the first parameter of the command (similar to `--terragrunt-quiet`).  I then ran it on one of my account's nested directories and looked at timings:

```

```

You can see it ran it the first time, then pulled it from cache each time after.  This particular `run_cmd` was looking up the account_id for the `saws2-dev` account name.

Hi,
I suspect introduction of `--terragrunt-global-cache` will break `run_cmd` invocations that depend on working directory without any explicit warnings

`--terragrunt-global-cache` is an argument you specify to `run_cmd()` just like `--terragrunt-quiet`, so it is intrinsically opt-in.

Does my comment clarify this? Is there anything preventing this PR from being merged?

# Wrog path in source, no warning

**rgarrigue** commented *Oct 14, 2019*

Hi

I've been trying to run this

```
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

terraform {
  source = "git::git@github.com:terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-security-group.git//modules/postgres?ref=v3.1.0"
}

dependency "vpc" {
  config_path = "../../vpc"
  mock_outputs = {
    id = "mock_vpc_id"
  }
}

dependency "metadata" {
  config_path = "../metadata"
  mock_outputs = {
    tags = { "mock_metadata_tags" : "tags" }
  }
}

inputs = {
  vpc_id              = dependency.vpc.outputs.id
  ingress_cidr_blocks = dependency.vpc.outputs.private_subnets_cidr_blocks
  description         = "Postgres (5432) from private subnets"
  name                = "${dependency.metadata.outputs.fqn}-postgres-vpc-private"
  tags                = dependency.metadata.outputs.tags
}
```

Nothing again and again

```

Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

Until I realized I should have `... postgresql?ref` instead of `... postgres?ref`. I wish I had a warning about that, something like "I checked, there's no such folder, check your source path"

Thanks again for Terragrunt & best regards,
<br />

I agree that the error messaging can be better! Need to dive deeper to figure out the best way to implement this, but if someone wants to take a crack at this in a PR, that would be great! üç∫

Rechecked issue in 2023, seems to fail now with:
```
$ terragrunt plan

ERRO[0002] Working dir modules/postgres from source git::ssh://git@github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-security-group.git?ref=v3.1.0 does not exist 
ERRO[0002] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1 

```

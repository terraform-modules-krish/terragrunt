# tflint should download modules using GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN

**marinalimeira** commented *Dec 9, 2022*

This issue is a follow-up from #2362.

In order to download private modules, `tflint` uses `GITHUB_TOKEN`, but Gruntwork's default environment variable for the GitHub token is `GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN`. So in Terragrunt, it should allow tflint to use `GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN`'s value.

Why would we use a token to download private modules? Don't we use Git/SSH URLs for modules?

The word `module` here is used ambiguously. The `tflint` plugin itself seems to be expecting this token to be available so it can authenticate to its API and make requests to a private repo: https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint/blob/51b71ab2366403ffd548ec97b5183a56ec1b8137/plugin/install.go#L240-L252

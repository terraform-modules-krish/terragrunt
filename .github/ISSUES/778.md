# Obfuscate Secret for encrypting state file in terragrunt output

**primeroz** commented *Jul 9, 2019*

When running terragrunt with an Encrypted GCS backend for state files the encryption password is printed on the Output.

This is bad especially when running terragrunt in a pipeline since the encryption password will be left over in the historical logs of every run

I currently just _sed it out_ but this is prone to break if the output string was to change, ideally terragrunt could treat those as sensitive and just print XXXX instead ? 

for example 
```
terraform init -backend-config=encryption_key=XXXXXXX -backend-config=project=my-project -backend-config=bucket=my-bucket -backend-config=prefix=terragrunt/zone/terraform.tfstate -get=false -get-plugins=false -backend=false -from-module=git::ssh://git@gitlab.com/xxxx/gke-terraform-overlay?ref=master -no-color /XXXXXXX/.terragrunt-cache/YWtrf-rqN2s9tYuJa3oRVZjMG0w/1t5BPiEk_I5qZT1KJxm6W-P2lvA
```

Answering myself,

I moved the encryption key to 

```
terraform {

    extra_arguments "project" {
      commands = ["${get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars()}"]

      env_vars = {
          GOOGLE_ENCRYPTION_KEY = "<MYKEY>"
      }
  }  
}
```

and is not showing anymore in the cli.

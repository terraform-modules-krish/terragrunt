# Allowing for terragrunt include to come from a git source?

**jmahowald** commented *Oct 25, 2017*

We've got several projects that have started using terragrunt, and are pretty happy with it.  Copying the top level terraform.tfvars though to those projects doesn't feel quite right.   If you agree that it makes sense and give me a pointer for what phase you would process it in, I could give a stab at allowing `include` to have a `git_src` attribute, or extending the interpretation of path.

That's an interesting thought. Can you expand on why you feel this way?

Just a general DRY principle.  Enforcing a consistent naming convention and rules for how to pick up optional/required vars is extremely useful across an org and is one of the primary motivators of terragrunt.  Being able to express that very concisely for all teams is simply easier to deal with and change with that centralized location

` include { 
src="mygiturl"
}`

That's an interesting idea. I could see adding this in one of two ways:

1. A `src` param specifically for `include`:

    ```hcl
    terragrunt = {
      include {
        src = "<url>"
      }
    }
    ```

1. A generic `download` helper that you can use anywhere, including in `include`:

    ```hcl
    terragrunt = {
      include {
        path = "${download(<url>)}"
      }
    }
    ```

Option 2 is probably a more general-purpose strategy. It could then be implemented with all the other [helper functions](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/config/config_helpers.go#L75). However, there are a few tricky pieces to work through:

1. What sorts of URLs would be supported? HTTP? Git? Probably for consistency, we should use [go-getter](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter).

1. Where should the file be downloaded to? Some temp folder? Should it be cached?

1. How will this work with other [helpers](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt#interpolation-syntax), such as `path_relative_to_include()`, `path_relative_from_include()`, etc? If it downloaded the file into a tmp folder, all those helpers would be useless.

1.  I was definitely assuming we'd use go-getter
2.  This function is different from other helpers in the sense those are just functions which don't actually have a side effect (I think).  That being said, the download helper clearly should return the location it is downloaded to locally.  not sure how all the temp location stuff already works, but that would be the cleanest I think.  I'd probably just default to the parent of the temp folders.    i also was thinking maybe the local location is an optional second parameter, but I don't know if it's really worth it.  


As for caching, sure, though the cost of refetching should be relatively small as the artifact itself is small (though I guess the git repo could have a bunch of other things in it).
Also, I think we'd end up having the same discussion on caching/local location on option 1 under the covers.

Yea, temp folder by default, and an optional second parameter make sense. I'm still worried that it wouldn't work well with the `xxx_relative_yyy` helpers, but that's probably OK. PRs welcome :)

Hopefully will put out a PR soon, thanks for the input

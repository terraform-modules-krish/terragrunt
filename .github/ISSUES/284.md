Not sure what I'm missing

It appears to setup remote state, but I never see anything written in

```] 2017/09/05 00:02:10 Initializing remote state for the s3 backend

It's the [most common issue we see](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/212). Check the link for a solution. Hopefully someone can submit a PR to fix this! I'll close now but if this doesn't solve your issue, let us know and we can re-open.

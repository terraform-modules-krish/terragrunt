# not working on github: invalid character 'c' looking for beginning of value

**Panke** commented *May 27, 2020*

Hi,

I am a new user to terraform and terragrunt and need some pointers on how to debug this issue. I have a (private) github project that uses terraform. I can successfully plan-all, validate-all and apply-all my infrastructure from my machine (ArchLinux, terragrunt 0.23.20, terraform v0.12.25). However it fails when I am using terragrunt from github actions.


> terragrunt error: [terragrunt] Encountered the following errors: Could not parse output from terragrunt config /home/runner/work/path/to/my/terragrunt.hcl. Underlying error: invalid character 'c' looking for beginning of value

I've attached my terragrunt files. Searching for this error turn up results that suggest I might have an encoding problem, but all my terraform and terragrunt files are ASCII according to `file`.

[terragrunt.hcl.txt](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/files/4690629/terragrunt.hcl.txt)
[parent_terragrunt.hcl.txt](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/files/4690643/parent_terragrunt.hcl.txt)

What's going on here? My github workflow file is

```
name: 'Terraform'

on:
  push:
    branches:
    - master
  pull_request:


env:
  GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS: ${{secrets.GKE_SA_KEY}}


jobs:

    defaults:
      run:

        working-directory: terraform

    # Checkout the repository to the GitHub Actions runner

    - name: 'Terragrunt Validate'
      id: plan
      run: |
        terragrunt validate-all

```

This error occurs when terragrunt is not able to parse the result of `terraform output` when processing a `dependency` block. Specifically, the error happens when the json terragrunt pulls out with `terraform output` is malformed.

One thing I know about the `setup-terraform` github action is that it automatically installs a terraform wrapper which manipulates the stdout and stderr so that it is compatible with github action pipelines (it outputs in a way to encode results in the pipeline). I am pretty sure this is what is causing terragrunt to misread the result of `output`, as the stdout is not coming straight from terraform and has extra stuff.

It should work if you either turn off `terraform_wrapper`, or set the [--terragrunt-tfpath](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli-options/#terragrunt-tfpath) directly to the terraform binary.

Thanks! Turning of the terraform_wrapper did it!

Saved my day. After spending 1 hour trying to find out why terratest doesn't work with github action , found the solution here and it fixed the problem. Thanks

Copy pastable:

```
      - name: Setup Terraform
        uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v1
        with:
          terraform_wrapper: false
```

@yorinasub17 : Thanks for the above response..I was getting the error so atleast now i know why. In my case, i need the terraform_wrapper: true because I want to sent the output of the plan to the PR. Hence, i tried the other method of setting `--terragrunt-tfpath` by running `terragrunt plan -no-color --terragrunt-tfpath $(which terraform)` but it still failed with the same output. Any ideas ?

`$(which terraform)` will return the terraform wrapper, so you aren't really doing anything by passing that to `--terragrunt-tfpath`. You need to find the path where the root `terraform` is installed.

> I want to sent the output of the plan to the PR

I don't think the `terraform` wrapper is going to help here because that only works if it is the top level binary (that is, you are directly calling `terraform`), but with `terragrunt`, Terragrunt is wrapping the `terraform` call so it becomes the top level. There needs to be a `terragrunt-wrapper` that implements the same logic as `terraform-wrapper`, but AFAIK, such a tool does not exist yet.

Thanks for the response @yorinasub17 
For those trying to achieve the same, i ended up with a work around - (old school), which actually works 


```
     - name: Run terragrunt validate and plan
        if: ${{ matrix.target }}
        id: plan
        run: |
          cd ${{ matrix.target }}
          echo "Y" | terragrunt run-all validate
          echo "PLAN-OUTPUT<<EOF" >> $GITHUB_ENV
          echo "Y" | terragrunt run-all plan -no-color >> $GITHUB_ENV
          echo "EOF" >> $GITHUB_ENV


      - uses: actions/github-script@v3
        if: github.event_name == 'pull_request' && ${{ matrix.target }}
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          script: |
            const output = `#### Terraform Plan ðŸ“–\`${{ steps.plan.outcome }}\`

            <details><summary>Show Plan</summary>

            \`\`\`\n
            ${{ env.PLAN-OUTPUT }}
            \`\`\`

            </details>

            *Pusher: @${{ github.actor }}, Action: \`${{ github.event_name }}\`, Working Directory: \`${{ env.tf_actions_working_dir }}\`, Workflow: \`${{ github.workflow }}\`*`;

            github.issues.createComment({
              issue_number: context.issue.number,
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              body: output
            })

```

# Mark terragrunt backend variable sensitive -> Do not output it to stdout/stderr

**lukasmrtvy** commented *May 22, 2019*

I noticed that terragrunt exposes all backend config arguments, there should be a something like sensitive variable, in my case I am getting access_key from get_env(), so something like sensitive_get_env() which will be not exposed to stdout would be nice!

```
[terragrunt] [/host/project/deployer/terraform] 2019/05/22 14:32:20 Running command: terraform --version
[terragrunt] 2019/05/22 14:32:21 Reading Terragrunt config file at /host/project/deployer/terraform/terraform.tfvars
[terragrunt] 2019/05/22 14:32:21 Running command: terraform init -backend-config=key=./terraform.tfstate -backend-config=access_key=EXPOSEDKEY -backend-config=storage_account_name=myazurestorage -backend-config=container_name=tfstates
```
I can imagine, if You are using Atlantis, if Terragrunt will exit with error code 1 on initialization, Atlantis will paste this output to Merge Request as commend and this is not good.

And of course if You are forwarding logs to ELK/Splunk/etc -> not good.

EDIT:  Maybe I can use -backend-config=path  ?
EDIT2: I belive it can be done with https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/18325, just like with AWS

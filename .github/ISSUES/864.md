# s3 backend creation issue with credential_process + source_profile + role_arn

**reegnz** commented *Sep 13, 2019*

I am trying to use terragrunt with [aws-vault](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault) but my configuration seems to fail with terragrunt (and terraform), but works fine for the cli for example.

I believe that this might be an issue with not using the latest SDK, so I would try to upgrade that first and see if that fixes the issue.

My aws config:
```ini
[profile work]
region=us-east-1
credential_process = aws-vault exec work --json --prompt=osascript

[profile playground-AdminRole]
region=us-east-1
source_profile=work
role_arn=arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/AdminRole
```

```

Terraform also has an issue with such an aws config: https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22653

Oh, interesting. Is `credential_process` must be something new? At any rate, a PR that updates AWS SDK version is welcome!

It's reasonably new yes, been around longer on the python side. Here's the [doc on the aws config](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/topic/config-vars.html#sourcing-credentials-from-external-processes). It's really handy when you have a federated identity provider and want to get auto-refreshing temp creds for cli actions.

Our team contributed the initial implementation to the [AWS GO SDK last year](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/pull/2217). It's been _slowly_ filtering through the ecosystem. AWS credential handling is still a total pain to implement well.

[Sidenote: Have you looked at [dependabot](https://dependabot.com/) to help keep dependency versions up-to-date?]

Nice 🍺

Considered it, but haven't had time to dig into the details and implement it.

@brikis98 I will have a go at bumping the SDK version, we'll see if that's enough. With terraform that one is a bit harder to crack :(

Thx!

#890 probably fixed this issue.

**reegnz** commented *Oct 25, 2019*


The accompanying terraform issue also got fixed: https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22653

Same applies regarding env variables here:
```
export AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG=1
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
export AWS_PROFILE=playground-AdminRole
```

Tested it, works OK.

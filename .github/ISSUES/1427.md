# `run_cmd` in `locals` block executed twice

**bendavies** commented *Nov 13, 2020*

Hi there,

It seems a `run_cmd` inside a `locals` block will be run twice.

### Reproducer:
`terragrunt.hcl`
```hcl
locals {
  foo = run_cmd("echo", uuid())
}
```

```bash
terragrunt -v
terragrunt version v0.26.2

terragrunt init

[terragrunt] 2020/11/13 15:33:16 Running command: terraform init
Terraform initialized in an empty directory!

The directory has no Terraform configuration files. You may begin working
with Terraform immediately by creating Terraform configuration files.
```

notice two different UUIDs in the log, which I believe shows this is not just a double logging issue.

Thanks!

If definitely happens to me too, I was about to report the same issue.

Hm, must be an issue with the parsing logic, as it takes several passes to parse everything. If anyone has time to dig into this, help would be greatly appreciated, as we're quite booked right now.

This happens because of [checkVersionConstraints()](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/cli/cli_app.go#L290), which leads to [cli_app.go#L405](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/cli/cli_app.go#L405). 

Since [config.PartialParseConfigFile()](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/config/config_partial.go#L165) always parses `locals` block, we get two executions.

Oh, bummer. Any thoughts on how to fix this?

@yorinasub17, in #1554 you had some great suggestions, do you already have a timeframe in which you plan to implement those? Is there any way one could help?

We're currently discovering a lot of dynamic information with a some `run_cmd` commands, which are quite expensive time-wise and the duplicate execution is not making it any better :-(

Should it be executed even when it's in negative `if` condition?
For config below it's executed always, and twice.
```
terraform {
  source = "/my_module"
}

inputs = {
  my_cmd = local.my_cmd
  my_value = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("my_config.hcl")).locals.my_value
}

locals {
  my_cmd = local.my_value == "some_value" ? jsondecode(run_cmd("--terragrunt-quiet", "python3", "./my_script.py")) : {}
}
```

When running without `--terragrunt-quiet` I see it's executed twice before `terraform init`.

Fixed in #1763 and released in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.31.6.

I think this may have regressed. I'm running v0.36.7 and the script is executing several times without caching the output:
```

time=2022-07-15T12:58:14+12:00 level=info msg=Executing hook: AwsAuthCheck
```
```hcl
locals {
	config = yamldecode(file("${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/config.yml"))
	deploy_type = trimspace(lower(run_cmd("sh", "${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/../bin/get-deploy-type.sh")))
	# ...
```
The bash script just prompts for valid input and only prints to stdout at the very end. Once all invocations of the script succeed, everything works as expected. Happy to know if I've just missed something.

Hi,
I think it is a side effect of https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/667 which introduced multiple time evaluations of HCL files to find value of `iam_role/get_aws_account_id/get_aws_caller_identity_arn/get_aws_caller_identity_user_id` and  invalidate cached `run_cmd` since AWS data may be used in arguments

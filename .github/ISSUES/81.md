# Spin-up misses modules in subfolders.

**josh-padnick** commented *Dec 19, 2016*

Given the following folder structure:

```
infrastructure-live
- stage
  - data-stores
    - postgres
    - redis
  - ecs-cluster
  - kms-master-key
  - vpc
```

I ran `terragrunt spin-up` and expected Terragrunt to apply all the above folders as long as each had a `.terragrunt` file. But the `stage/data-stores` is ignored, even though both `stage/data-stores/postgres` and `stage/data-stores/redis` are confirmed to have a `.terragrunt` file .

Here's a [zip file of the full infrastructure-live directory](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B161Wobnisu-cVo0RHE3bzJESVk) in a private Google Drive folder available to Gruntworkers only so someone else can reproduce.

Here's the output. Note the inclusion of ignored modules.

Hmm, no clue what would cause that. We'll probably need to add some log output to see what's going on.

Check out #82 where I just fixed it.

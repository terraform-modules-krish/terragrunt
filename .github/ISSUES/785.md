# postpone check for configured backend after init hook is executed

**mariux** commented *Jul 13, 2019*

**Change-Request:** 
Postpone check for `checkTerraformCodeDefinesBackend()` after `before_hook`s are run.

I guess it makes sense to run a `before_hook` before deciding how to actually execute the`terraform` command because executing a before hook might change the situation inside the cache directory.

**Background/Use-Case/Motivation:**
I want to stay DRY in terms of backend configuration so we are actually defining it once at top level of the repository along with the terragrunt.hcl top-level file - as we want to use the same backend for the full repository anyway.

```
  before_hook "copy_backend_before_init" {
    commands = [ "init" ]
    execute  = [ "cp", "-v", "${get_terragrunt_dir()}/${find_in_parent_folders("backend.tf")}", "." ]
  }
```

this fails because `checkTerraformCodeDefinesBackend` is run before `terraform init` and before `before_hook` for init is executed.

error I run into:

```
[terragrunt] 2019/07/13 22:24:44 Found remote_state settings in /home/[...]/terragrunt.hcl but no backend block in the Terraform code in /home/[...]/.terragrunt-cache/rpSgVm5WzqsJDKJ70EGvpZ9ZxXw/A35GeYiqYDYXDWZftKtd1kkU5ic. 
   You must define a backend block (it can be empty!) in your Terraform code or your remote state settings will have no effect! It should look something like this:

terraform {
  backend "s3" {}
}
```

`backend.tf` in top-level directory is (which we have to copy to every module atm (?)):
```
terraform {
  backend "s3" {}
  required_version = ">= 0.12.0"
}
```
I also tried to use the `init-from-module` hook but this one is not executed in the cache directory so I can only use it as a workaround (before: copy to current dir, after init: delete form terragrunt dir) which works now, but is kind of hacky.

This is basically a duplicate of https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/749...

Or at least, if init-from-module were operating out of the cache dir as it did before, the described use case would still work as it did before. :/

If #749 is fixed, would that fix this issue? If so, we can close this one as a dupe.

**mariux** commented *Jul 21, 2019*

as far as i get it, fixing #749 would just enable a second work around for the issue.

current flow seems to be:
1) run checks to validate terraform execution environment is okay (e.g. check for backend config present)
2) run before_hook
3) run terraform
4) run after_hook

what would make more sense might be switching 1 and 2
1) run before hook (creates backend config)
2) validate environment before running terraform (would succeed now)
3) run terraform
4) run after_hook

No matter where the hooks are executed. concrete use case is not to run `checkTerraformCodeDefinesBackend` before the `before_hook` has been executed (but after).

I think I agree with what @mariux is saying, but I also wonder how other people are solving this breaking change between 0.18 and 0.19?

The new `terragrunt-read-config` after hook might help with this use case...?

we will upgrade and give feedback asap. thx for the work done.

~first accidentally tried with before hook which failed... but after reading again i saw it's a after hook and this actually works like a charm and fixes the issue described above..
:heart:  thank you for fixing/enabling this. closing ticket.~

sorry, celebrated too early... :

this is also true for the new hook... it is not executed in the cache directory and would need the same hacky workaround of removing files afterwards.

We just released https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.22.0, which I believe will address your use case (let us know if it doesn't!). See [the updated docs](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/keep-your-remote-state-configuration-dry/#using-the-generate-property-to-generate-terraform-code-for-managing-remote-state) for more info.

I ran into the issue OP describes and was able to solve it using `generate` in my top-level terragrunt.hcl's `remote_state` block! 
***

**yorinasub17** commented *Oct 13, 2020*

Closing this as I believe the `generate` approach will fully solve this problem. If there is a need for additional features, please open a new issue.

Thanks everyone for the feedback and use cases!

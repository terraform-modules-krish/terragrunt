# path_relative_to_include() variant working where the include block is defined

**ebarault** commented *Apr 9, 2018*

From the doc:

Example project layout:
```
/my/tf
├── terraform.tfvars <- [1]
├── app
│   ├── dev.tfvars
│   └── terraform.tfvars <- [2]
```

in **[1]** 
```
terragrunt = {
  remote_state {
  # ...
  }
} 
```

in **[2]**
```
# ...
terragrunt = {
  include {
    path = "${find_in_parent_folders()}"
  }
}
```

I run terragrunt from the root (where [1] is located) using the `--terragrunt-working-dir` option:
```
terragrunt apply --terragrunt-working-dir app
```

in **[2]** i have a defined hook leveraging a function that requires the relative path from **[1]** to **[2]**.

I tried using the `path_relative_to_include()` but it returns `.`, which is logic since the hook is defined the file where the include block is also defined, so `.` is correct in that case.

I'm looking for clues on how to boostrap an helper that would return the relative path from **[1]** to **[2]**, but not relying only on the `include` block to make sure the relative path is also known where the `include` block is defined.

Thoughts?

So you're looking for a helper to return `./app` for the folder structure above?

precisely, yes

Hm, I don't think we have a helper that does that. `path_relative_to_include` would work if it was in [1], but as you said, if it's in [2], it just returns `.`. `find_in_parent_folders` will return the path from [2] to [1]. What hook are you executing? Could it do some file manipulation using `find_in_parent_folders` or `get_parent_tfvars_dir()` and `get_tfvars_dir()`?

The hook executes a python program i have control on, so it could virtually manipulate any of the absolute path the 3 helpers you named return to construct the relative path.
But the aforementioned program is meant to be used/maintained in several contexts by several people, possibly open-sourced, hence its api and internal logic should remain as simple as possible.

If you think such an helper is rather simple to implement in terragrunt and if you're willing to accept such a contribution, then i'm happy to give it a try when i find time.

Sure, I think a helper like that would be a useful addition!

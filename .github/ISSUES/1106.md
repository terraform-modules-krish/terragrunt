Here's my remote config.
`remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  generate = {
    path      = "backend.tf"
    if_exists = "overwrite"
  }
  config = {
    bucket         = "naimishshah-dev-terraform-c13f60a4-e2a6-4c1b-9647-db3a47932b60"
    key            = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-west-2"
    encrypt        = true
    dynamodb_table = "my-lock-table-c13f60a4-e2a6-4c1b-9647-db3a47932b60"
    profile        = "personal-services-dev"
  }
}`

Here is the output from Terragrunt/Terraform.

What version of Terragrunt?

Also, minor request: could you wrap your code and log output in a [fenced code block](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks#fenced-code-blocks) so it's easier to read? Thanks!

Hello! I am having the same issue
 This is my remote state configuration 

```
remote_state {
  backend      = "s3"

  generate = {
    path      = "backend.tf"
    if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  }

  config = {
    encrypt        = true
    region         = "eu-west-1"
    key            = format("%s/terraform.tfstate", path_relative_to_include())
    bucket         = "terraform-states-stg"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks-stg"
  }
}
```
The S3 bucket ends like this

terraform version v0.12.25
terragrunt  v0.23.17

I am also seeing this, and I'm wondering if it's an issue with terragrunt or some restriction imposed by my AWS account settings.

Also seeing this same issue. My `remote_state` looks the same as @Quaiks. Any solution for this?

**brikis98** commented *Jan 6, 2021*

Did Terragrunt create the S3 buckets for you? If so, do you have the log output from that?
***

**ahummel25** commented *Jan 6, 2021*

I ended up tearing down my state management infra (S3, dynamo, etc.) and recreating. It versioned my S3 bucket that time. I probably did something incorrect the first time or maybe had the versioning flag set to false by accident.

I believe the fundamental issue exposed here is that terragrunt only enforces these features on the initial bucket creation, and not on existing buckets that were created outside terragrunt, or by older versions of terragrunt.

I recall seeing a ticket requesting this exact feature, but can't find it at the moment. Will keep this open with the `needs-triage` label, until we can find (or create a new one) that feature request ticket and link to it.

Would it be safe to enable versioning on the bucket manually, after it has been created?

Fix released in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.37.0

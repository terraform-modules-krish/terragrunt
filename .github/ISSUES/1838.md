# No binaries for v0.33.2

Binaries are missing on the new release, hence this is breaking our build.
Thanks for the good work!

Binaries are there now. Even when it's always working, I think the tag is created first, then the binaries post. So there's always some amount of time where they won't be available. Might be worth pinning your build and using another tool to update the version.

@lorengordon Is correct. There is a minimum ~10 minute delay for the binaries to show up after the tag as we wait for CircleCI to compile and publish them.

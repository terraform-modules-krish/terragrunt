# How to use complex types (map, list) in variables with v0.19 ?

**akomlik** commented *Jun 11, 2019*

The [migration guide](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/_docs/migration_guides/upgrading_to_terragrunt_0.19.x.md) says to define variables in the input block:  `Whenever you run a Terragrunt command, such as terragrunt apply, Terragrunt will make these variables available to your Terraform module as environment variables`

However, if the variable of complex type how it this even possible to pass it as environment variable?

for example, in our prior (v.0.18) terraform.tfvars for Aiven Kafka module we have now:

USER_CONFIG = {
  ip_filter = [
    "x.y.z.y/32",
  ]
  kafka_version = "2.2"
}

Reading up on documentation I found that such complex structures will be translated to a quoted strings in json format. I guess this can be closed

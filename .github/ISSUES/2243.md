# `terragrunt validate` returns an error when local variables are using data sources

**teddy-ambona** commented *Aug 18, 2022*

terragrunt version: v0.38.6

Here is my project file structure:

```
live
 └ global
 	└ s3
 	└ iam		
 └ _envcommon
 	└ <resource>.hcl
 └ <environment>
 	└ env.hcl
 	└ <resource>
 		└ main.tf
 		└ README.md
 		└ terragrunt.hcl
 └ README.md
 └ terragrunt.hcl
```
where  `<resource>` can be "vpc" or "security-groups" for instance.

in `live/dev/env.hcl`

```
# Set common variables for the environment. These are automatically pulled in to configure the remote state bucket in the root
# terragrunt.hcl configuration.

# The attribute `${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}` will be current account number.
data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}

# The attribue `${data.aws_iam_account_alias.current.account_alias}` will be current account alias
data "aws_iam_account_alias" "current" {}

# The attribute `${data.aws_region.current.name}` will be current region
data "aws_region" "current" {}

# Set as [local values](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/locals.html)
locals {
  aws_region          = data.aws_region.current.name
  account_id          = data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id
  account_alias       = data.aws_iam_account_alias.current.account_alias
  environment         = "dev"
  remote_state_bucket = "financial-data-api-demo-state"
}
```

Running `terragrunt validate` gives me an error related to the variables coming from the data blocks in `live/dev/env.hcl`. 

The error:

```

```

I understand this tool is for static analysis but is there a way to ignore this error ?

Hi,
usage of `data` will work only in TF files, it will not be resolved by terragrunt in HCL files
If is required to access this data from terragrunt, `data` blocks can be extracted to a separate dependency and accessed through `outputs`

https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#dependency

# Using include variables in dependencies.path list fails on terragrunt 0.32

**daniel-anova** commented *Sep 17, 2021*

Previously using `include.inputs.my_variable` was allowed in dependencies.path list.

```hcl
include {
  path   = find_in_parent_folders()
  expose = true
}

dependencies {
  paths = [
    include.inputs.rg_dir
  ]
}
```

With the changes done in terragrunt 0.32.X the same code gives the following error:

```
ERRO[0000] Error processing module at '/home/df/source/tg-bug-test/child/terragrunt.hcl'. How this module was found: Terragrunt config file found in a subdirectory of /home/df/source/tg-bug-test/child. Underlying error: /home/df/source/tg-bug-test/child/terragrunt.hcl:12,19-26: Attempt to get attribute from null value; This value is null, so it does not have any attributes., and 1 other diagnostic(s)
ERRO[0000] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1
```

The same code works with no error in terragrunt 0.31.11.

Attached I've included a sample test case: [tg-bug-test.zip](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/files/7186277/tg-bug-test.zip)

This is actually the result of fixing another bug as part of the expose, where the dependency fetching interfered with terragrunt stack generation when `expose = true`.

What happened in 0.32 that is related to the use here is that we switched the exposed `include` parsing to also honor [the configuration parsing order](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/getting-started/configuration/#configuration-parsing-order). This means that blocks like `dependency` and `dependencies` can only refer to `included` blocks that are in the same level of parsing (in this case, `locals`, `include` and `dependency`/`dependencies`).

Without this fix, when you use `include` with `expose = true` on a config that has a `dependency` block, `terragrunt` crashes saying the dependency out put is not available, because before it was trying to fully parse the included config while it was building the terragrunt dependency tree. So I'm not inclined to revert to the old behavior because it breaks another use case that is critical to DRY-ing terragrunt (`include` expose config that has `dependency` blocks).

There might be some things we can do to allow this kind of use in limited fashion (e.g., one idea is to fully parse an included config if it has not `dependency` or `dependencies` blocks defined), but I'll need to think a bit about what is the best way to do that.

In the meantime, is it possible to workaround this limitation by using `local`? E.g., can you assign `rg_dir` to a `local` and then use that local in the `inputs` and the exposed include (`include.locals.rg_dir` instead of `include.inputs.rg_dir`)?

Currently we'll stick to 0.31.11 so we wont have to make any changes to our code.

In the long term `local` could be an option depending on the solution you decide to take for this issue.

Just to double check, does the `included` config (the root config where `rg_dir` is defined) have `dependency` or `dependencies` block?

NOTE: #1817 should resolve this issue for you, assuming your root config doesn't have any `dependency` or `dependencies` blocks defined.

Hi there, we do indeed use dependencies and even need the dependencies outputs to build the path.

So going by the parsing order means we couldn't just change to use `local` as I original stated since it's not valid to use dependencies in `locals`.

Our use case is having one main infrastructure "repo" with several child tenants "repo"  that receive values trough a bridge shared module that's used for base values on tenant deployments.

The actual code we is something like this: 
```hcl
primary_data_rg_dir  = "${local.geography != "_global" ? local.geo_dir : local.svc_dir}/${dependency.main.outputs.vars[local.geography].data_primary_locality}/resource-group"
failover_data_rg_dir = "${local.geography != "_global" ? local.geo_dir : local.svc_dir}/${dependency.main.outputs.vars[local.geography].data_failover_locality}/resource-group"
```

So the only current workaround I'm seeing is to just "hardcode" the path values that come from the main "repo" dependency to each tenant's `locals` .

The proposed fix is merged, but that does not address the use case described above. The core feature request here is to allow constructing `dependency` config_paths based on other `dependency` outputs.

Unfortunately, as it is now, I don't see if there is a nice way to support this without breaking the other use case, which I believe is much more common than this one. I believe this will be a difficult nut to crack, and not sure if we would ever get to it...

Just to give an update on our end, we ended up going with local by copying some key values instead of depending on remote state.

With that, we're able to create all paths in the base locals making them usable everywhere.

It does mean any change to those values will require replicating the change to a dozen repos which shouldn't happen often if at all (fingers crossed).

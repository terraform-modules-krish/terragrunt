# Issues with *-all commands and terraform plugin cache directory

**pietro** commented *Jun 5, 2020*

If I set `TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR` to any directory and use any terragrunt `*-all` commands fail with `Could not satisfy plugin requirements` errors. My repro case bellow:

terragrunt.hcl:
```hcl
remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  generate = {
    path      = "backend.tf"
    if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  }
  config = {
    bucket  = "my-terraform-test-state-test"
    key     = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
    region  = "us-west-2"
    encrypt = true
  }
}
```

a/terragrunt.hcl:
```hcl
terraform {
  source = "../example-tf-module"
}

include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}
```

example-tf-module/main.tf
```hcl
data "aws_region" "current" {}

output "aws_region" {
  value = data.aws_region.current.name
}
```

then I create directories `b` through `m` and copy `a/terragrunt.hcl` to them. My final directory tree is:
```
.
├── a
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
├── b
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
├── c
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
├── d
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
├── e
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
├── example-tf-module
│   └── main.tf
├── f
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
├── g
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
├── h
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
├── i
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
├── j

├── l
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
├── m
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
└── terragrunt.hcl
```

If cd to any of the one letter directories `terragrunt validate` works fine. From the root dir, with both `TF_LOG` and `TG_LOG` set to debug, `terragrunt validate-all` will fail some of the modules. TF/TG log and TF/TG putput from failed modules:

Using `--terragrunt-parallelism 1` fixes this but it makes my real code super slow to validate/plan/apply. My workaround is to emulate `terragrunt init-all --terragrunt-parallelism 1` using bash to `terragrunt init` each module sequentially.

This is because terraform isn't really designed to handle multiple concurrent calls to the binary at once. This leads to issues when all the terraform processes are trying to initialize the plugin cache and download the same versions of the provider (overwrite each other). With that said, this should work as expected once the plugin directory is sufficiently seeded.

Here are two other workarounds for this:

- Continuously cycle between deleting the terragrunt cache (`find . -name ".terragrunt-cache" | xargs rm -r`) and running `terragrunt validate-all` until the plugin cache is seeded.

- Create a module for the sole purpose of seeding the plugin cache. This module should only have provider blocks with all the versions that you need to use. Then, you can run `terragrunt validate` just in that module to seed the cache.

Solving this is something we've been thinking about, but we don't have any design for a solution right now.

Terragrunt *-all commands run implicit `terraform init` if no `.terragrunt-cache` directory exists.
@yorinasub17 could additional parameter `--terragrunt-init-parallelism` be implemented, so terragrunt would not run  `terraform init`  in parallel avoiding this issue?

Very strange that I had pipeline with `TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR` and ` terragrunt plan-all` command on fresh-spawned VMs, and it worked well for a long time but stopped to work due to this issue a few weeks ago.
***

**yorinasub17** commented *Nov 25, 2020*

If there is a way to implement `--terragrunt-init-parallelism` without overcomplicating the pipeline, then that could work. With that said, it could be confusing to have multiple `parallelism` flags in that fashion.

Side note: I personally would rather invest in a proper dependency management solution. E.g., would be great if you could run `terragrunt dep-retrieve` which would populate the plugin cache, and also some kind of module cache so reusable modules for the same versions are also shared. It would be more expensive to implement/design, but has high value.

As a quick and maybe quite clean workaround i followed another approach: i quickly wrote a bash wrapper script around terragrunt which basically does only the following:

1) create a directory for caching of terraform plugins and export it as environment variable TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR
2) read a .tf file in which all needed plugins are specified
3) run terraform init and clean up .terraform* files afterwards
4) finally run terragrunt
I think this could be implemented natively into terragrunt or am i wrong and this would solve the drawback of multiple parallel downloads of providers quite neatly by just creating and populating a caching directory beforehand.

Maybe as plan for implementation for the steps:
- To use this, a parameter --terragrunt-caching could be established which would "activate" all of this
- A parameter --terragrunt-cache-dir could let one specify the directory in which the cache will be stored. This cache dir could be purged before the run so one could always start with an empty cache. Also, this would shall be exported to the environment so terraform gets aware of all of this
- A parameter --terragrunt-cache-plugins could get a list of plugins to cache (for example as comma-separated string hashicorp/aws, hashicorp/template, ...). With the terragrunt native generate logic, one could generate a terraform file which only defines terraform { required_providers { ... stuff. Alternatively, the parameter --terragrunt-cache-plugins could be set directly to a terraform file.
- Then just run terraform init in a temporary directory (for example /tmp/terragrunt-init-dir) or maybe even in the directory specified in the --terragrunt-cache-dir directory. Afterwards clean up the additionally generated files .terraform*
- Continue as usual

Does this seem realistic? I think this shouldn't be too hard and is quite clean. If yes, the number of needed downloads could be reduced drastically when having dozens of modules if one knows beforehand which plugins are needed.

**askoriy** commented *Dec 18, 2020*

@Zyntogz your trick works because you have your terraform code locally.
But if terraform modules are used (`source = github.com/...`) then *.tf files will not be populated until `terragrunt init` executed
***

**mhulscher** commented *Feb 11, 2021*

I worked around this by creating a cache-directory per plan. This does mean that each plan will have to download providers at least once, but on subsequent runs the cache can be used to fetch the providers. I configure my CI to cache the entire `.terraform-plugin-cache` directory. I added the following to my top-level `terragrunt.hcl`:

```hcl
locals {
  terraform_cache_dir = format("%s/%s", get_env("TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR", "~/.terraform-plugin-cache"), path_relative_to_include())
}

terraform {
  before_hook "provider_cache" {
    commands = ["init", "validate", "plan", "apply"]
    execute  = ["mkdir", "-pv", local.terraform_cache_dir]
  }

  extra_arguments "provider_cache" {
    commands  = ["init", "validate", "plan", "apply"]
    arguments = []

    env_vars = {
      TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR = local.terraform_cache_dir
    }
  }
}
```

We have some projects with many `terragrunt.hcl` files (e.g. `infrastructure-live` repository), and `terragrunt *-all` executions have started depleting the available disk space in our GitLab CI shared runners. As we don't maintain Terragrunt cache between jobs, a quick workaround for us has been to cleanup the generated Terragrunt cache as each module is processed:

```hcl
# In the general terragrunt.hcl configuration file.

terraform {
  after_hook "after_delete_terragrunt_cache" {
    commands     = ["validate", "plan", "apply"]
    execute      = ["rm", "-rf", ".terragrunt-cache"]
    working_dir  = "${get_terragrunt_dir()}"
    run_on_error = true
  }
}
```

Having a centralized `TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR` directory didn't work for us, when using Terragrunt parallelism, as many times concurrent module executions find partially downloaded providers, and fail.

@adamantike 
How are you managing your "output.tfplan"? 
After adding this section output is deleted every time and the execution is ending with:
```
 Error: Failed to load "output.tfplan" as a plan file
│
│ Error: stat output.tfplan: no such file or directory
```

**Xat59** commented *Jul 28, 2022*

So we've also encountered this issue when using `terragrunt run-all` commands together with `plugin-dir`.

Here is how we've fixed it :

```hcl
terraform {
    source = "path/to/tf/module"

    extra_arguments "terraform_args" {
        commands  = ["init"]
        arguments = [
            "-plugin-dir=/path/to/terraform/plugin-cache/"
        ]
    }
}
```

Hope it'll help you.

**adamantike** commented *Aug 16, 2022*

@headincl0ud, you can either:
* Run the command specifying `-out ...` to a path that is not within the `.terragrunt-cache` folder, so the `rm` command doesn't delete the generated plans, or
* Replace `execute = ["rm", "-rf", ".terragrunt-cache"]` with a command that deletes `.terragrunt-cache` content excluding `*.tfplan` files (e.g. using `find`).

@Xat59, take into account that the approach of centralizing the plugin directory is susceptible to the issue explained in [this comment](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1212#issuecomment-640948949). With parallelism set, and a project with many `terragrunt.hcl` files, chance for `init` executions to fail by reading plugins partially downloaded by other parallel executions increase.

I am using terragrunt together with atlantis and [terragrunt-config-generator](https://github.com/transcend-io/terragrunt-atlantis-config) and hit the same issue.
Plugins are already present in the `TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR` but still in most cases more than 50% of plans fail with errors like this:

```
Error: Required plugins are not installed

The installed provider plugins are not consistent with the packages
selected in the dependency lock file:
   - registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/google-beta: the cached package for registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/google-beta 4.67.0 (in .terraform/providers) does not match any of the checksums recorded in the dependency lock file 
```

What confuses me, is the versions it looks up in the cache.
Here it is `google-beta 4.67.0`, but in the `.terraform.lock.hcl` it is fixed to `4.48.0`:

```
provider "registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/google-beta" {
  version     = "4.48.0"
  constraints = "4.48.0"
``` 

Is this a separate issue I am encountering here?

**geekofalltrades** commented *Jun 1, 2023*

I fixed something like this in #2542. Are you using Terragrunt >=v0.45.12?
***

**norman-zon** commented *Jun 1, 2023*

I was on v0.44.5. Upgrading to v0.45.18 fixed the issue. Thank you very much!

**albgus** commented *Jul 6, 2023*

@geekofalltrades I'm still seeing this with Terragrunt `v0.48.0` and Terraform `v1.5.2`.

Seeding the plugin cache does not seem to help either, I'm running into this issue after running a `terragrunt run-all plan`. It seems this for some reason starts re-downloading the same provider that is already installed in the plugin cache.

```
│ Error: Required plugins are not installed
│ 
│ The installed provider plugins are not consistent with the packages
│ selected in the dependency lock file:
│   - registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws: the cached package for registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws 5.6.2 (in .terraform/providers) does not match any of the checksums recorded in the dependency lock file
│ 
│ Terraform uses external plugins to integrate with a variety of different
│ infrastructure services. To download the plugins required for this
│ configuration, run:
│   terraform init
```

I can not find any way to use the plugin cache without terragrunt breaking completely so I guess I'll just have to commit to keeping tens of GB with copies of the same provider library.

`run-all plan` is parallelized, and the cache still doesn't support parallel write. You could try deleting the current cache for and running again with `--terragrunt-parallelism 1` (or whatever the flag is). We solve this by having a separate no-op module that requires the union of all the providers we use and just running `init` on it to warm the cache.

Hi @geekofalltrades, 

Terragrunt itself does not install providers, Terraform is responsible for that, and as stated in their official [documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/config/config-file#provider-plugin-cache), they do not guarantee safe operation if init happens in parallel. 
> `Note: The plugin cache directory is not guaranteed to be concurrency safe. The provider installer's behavior in environments with multiple terraform init calls is undefined.`

Thus, we cannot influence it in any way.

Resolved in [v0.50.11](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.50.11) release.

# `terragrunt render-json` fails in certain cases

**infraredgirl** commented *Aug 29, 2022*

Running the latest build, `terragrunt render-json` fails with multiple errors like this:
```
│ Error: Backend initialization required, please run "terraform init"
│
│ Reason: Initial configuration of the requested backend "s3"
│
│ The "backend" is the interface that Terraform uses to store state,
│ perform operations, etc. If this message is showing up, it means that the
│ Terraform configuration you're using is using a custom configuration for
│ the Terraform backend.
│
│ Changes to backend configurations require reinitialization. This allows
│ Terraform to set up the new configuration, copy existing state, etc. Please
│ run
│ "terraform init" with either the "-reconfigure" or "-migrate-state" flags
│ to
│ use the current configuration.
│
│ If the change reason above is incorrect, please verify your configuration
│ hasn't changed and try again. At this point, no changes to your existing
│ configuration or state have been made.
```
Followed by another error at the end
```

hm, I get similar errors when terragrunt was executed without configured AWS account, once I configured access, it started to fail with
```
╷
│ Error: Failed to load state: AccessDenied: Access Denied
```

I think during evaluation of `render-json` is tried to read modules output which leads to errors for situations when modules weren't deployed, most probably should be used mock outputs from each dependency

Hey @denis256 thanks for the evaluation of this bug. Agreed, I don't think that AWS auth should be required to execute `render-json`. Would you be able to work on a fix?

Yes, looking to fix this issue - looks like execution of `terraform output` is trying to read the remote state...

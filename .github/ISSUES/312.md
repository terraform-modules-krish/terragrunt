# "terragrunt version" prints interesting output

**kevinburke** commented *Oct 9, 2017*

If I run

```
terragrunt --version
```

I get the following output:

```
 $ terragrunt --version
terragrunt version
```

If I run `terragrunt version` I get:

```
$ terragrunt version

```

It seems like there are at least two problems here, one is that terragrunt can't tell you the version, and one is that the return code was not determinable. 

I'm running Terraform version 0.9.5. I downloaded Terragrunt today, but I can't tell you which version I use, unfortunately.

I'm also able to reproduce this error with Terraform v0.10.7.

```
$ terragrunt version

I guess another way of framing the title issue is "loading a config file should not be a requirement of printing the version string"

That's weird...

```
> terragrunt --version
terragrunt version v0.13.7
```

Agreed, however, that running `terragrunt version` should not produce an error message!

PRs welcome!

Oops...I missed the original nuance of `--version` vs `version`

```
$ terragrunt --version                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
terragrunt version v0.13.5

$ terraform --version

Ah, if you install the compiled binary or use the ldflags, it prints correctly, I believe. From `main.go`

```go
// This variable is set at build time using -ldflags parameters. For more info, see:
// http://stackoverflow.com/a/11355611/483528
var VERSION string
```

I installed by running `go install -v -race ./...`, hence no version. Maybe you should set the version to "tip" by default, so it prints something.

Ah, yes, if you're running from source, the `VERSION` flag will not be set. Setting a default seems like a good idea!

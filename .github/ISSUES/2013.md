# skip auto init of SÂ§ backend not working

**AlexanderWiechert** commented *Feb 9, 2022*

If try to get terragrunt running in a gitlab ci pipeline I've encountered the following issue. I need to skip the autocreation of the S3 backend or just auto answer with yes.

`terragrunt init --terragrunt-non-interactive

I'm not able to get this running. The only thing which looks promissing is the `--terragrunt-non-interactive` flag. But this leds into ` The AWS Access Key Id you provided does not exist in our records`

Hi,
in the CICD environment, you have configured `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`?

Usually `AWS Access Key Id you provided does not exist in our records` error means that keys aren't configured.

They keys where set via hashicorp vault. This does work. This happens only if I enable the init step with `--terragrunt-non-interactive` flag set.

Maybe execution with `--terragrunt-log-level debug` will show more details on what went wrong

Can be closed. The issues was a missconfiguration. But the error message does net lead me to it.

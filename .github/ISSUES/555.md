# Option to execute apply even if my before_hook fails

**bfleming-ciena** commented *Aug 29, 2018*

I tried to use run_on_error inside the extra_arguments block, because I wanted to do a before_hook that would create my tf workspace with terraform workspace new.  But if the workspace already exists, then terragrunt won't continue and execute apply.  I want to say it is safe to execute apply if my before_hook fails.

I don't think that's currently supported. I suppose we could add support for an `ignore_errors = true` param in hooks that says to ignore the exit code of the hook and keep running things (including the call to Terraform itself) even if a hook fails. PR welcome.

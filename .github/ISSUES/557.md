# Interpolation variables in modules

**ozbillwang** commented *Aug 30, 2018*

When call the tf module, I used to feed some dynamic variables to that module

```
module xxx {
  source = "..."
  name = "${local.name_prefix}-xxx"
  file = "${data.template_file.setting.rendered}"
  ...
  vpc_id = "${data.terraform_remote_state.vpc.vpc_id}"
  account_id   = "${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}"
  ...
}
```

Terraform does NOT process interpolations in `.tfvars` files. So how can I handle these in `terraform.tfvars` with terragrunt?

The code you have above _is_ the module you'd deploy with Terragrunt. That is, you'd create, say, `modules/my-module/main.tf`, and in it, call `module "xxx" { ... }`, fill in variables, use interpolations, etc. Anything that varies between environments would be exposed as a variable in `modules/my-module/vars.tf`. You would then use Terragrunt to deploy `modules/my-module` and the variables you define in your `terraform.tfvars` would not use/need any interpolations.

Thanks @brikis98 

Maybe I didn't explain my problem clearly 

I knew how to use basic `terragrunt`, but when deal with the module's variables, I can't directly write `terraform.tfvars` as below.


```
terragrunt = {
  terraform {
    source = "modulexxxx"
  }

  include = {
    path = "${find_in_parent_folders()}"
  }
}

name="${local.name_prefix}-xxx"
file ="${data.template_file.setting.rendered}"
vpc_id="${data.terraform_remote_state.vpc.vpc_id}"
account_id="${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}"
another_name="${var.another_name}"
```
I give 5 samples which I used to reference tf module before, but how to do that with terragrunt?

I just answered that above. You put all the interpolations into `modulexxxx`. Not into `terraform.tfvars`. Please look at the examples.

That will be inconvenience. It changes the way we write Terraform.

**brikis98** commented *Aug 30, 2018*

I don't think it does. If you already have `modulexxx`, and you're using it in your Terraform code `foo`, then somewhere in `foo`, you are using interpolations. All I'm saying is point Terragrunt at `foo`.

Do you mean, if I need interpolation variables in a module, then I have to write a wrapper module to call that original module, this is weird.

Maybe I didn't fully understand your explanation, let me think again. 
***

**brikis98** commented *Aug 30, 2018*

Yes, that's exactly what I mean. You write a wrapper module that configures things the way you need them for your deployment: i.e., it configures the `provider`, `terraform` settings (e.g., min version, backends), `terraform_remote_state`, variables, outputs, etc.

most my tf modules need use interpolation variables ...

Seems this is the design in terragrunt. Looks nothing can do in current situation. 

Thanks.

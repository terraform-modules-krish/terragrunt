# New feature skip=true doesn't work

**aperigault** commented *May 14, 2019*

Hello,

New feature skip=true introduced [here](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/commit/bbbcec1628280bda5a9807055f87154940b60afe) to ignore root terraform.tfvars during xxx-all commands seems to not work.

I have a required_var_files in my terraform.tfvars :

`terragrunt = {
  skip = true

  terraform {
    extra_arguments "-var-file" {
      commands = ["${get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars()}"]

      required_var_files = [
        "${get_tfvars_dir()}/${find_in_parent_folders("file1.tfvars")}",
        "${get_tfvars_dir()}/${find_in_parent_folders("file2.tfvars")}",
      ]
    }

    extra_arguments "custom_vars" {
      commands = ["${get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars()}"]

      arguments = [
        "-var", "remote_state_region=us-west-1",
        "-var", "remote_state_bucket=terraform-${get_aws_account_id()}",
      ]
    }
  }
}`

but this file does not exist at the root level. So I attempt to skip this file but terragrunt seems to continue to read my file :

The error is:

> Could not find a file2.tfvars in any of the parent folders of /test/terraform.tfvars

Does that file exist? If not, then isn't `required_var_files` operating as expected?
***

**barryib** commented *May 15, 2019*

@brikis98 those files exist, but not in parent folder of the root `terraform.tfvars`.

Actually, the repository structure is like this :

```
├── terraform.tfvars
└── region
    ├── prod
    │   ├── file1.tfvars
    │   ├── file2.tfvars
    │   ├── application_1
    │   │   └── terraform.tfvars
    │   ├── application_2
    │   │   └── terraform.tfvars
    │   ├── application_3
    │   │   └── terraform.tfvars
```
When the working directory is `application_1` per exemple, we can run terragrunt without problem (it finds file1.tfvars and file2.tfvars with `find_in_parent_folders()`).

The root `terraform.tfvars` is only for DRY purpose. It define buckets and variables, but it doesn't define any infrastructure.

The problem is that, terragrunt is trying to evaluate interpolations (here `find_in_parent_folders()`) even if `skip` is set to `true`.

```hcl
  required_var_files = [
    "${get_tfvars_dir()}/${find_in_parent_folders("file1.tfvars")}",
    "${get_tfvars_dir()}/${find_in_parent_folders("file2.tfvars")}",
  ]
```

> Does that file exist? If not, then isn't required_var_files operating as expected?

Yes, those files are required, but not in the root level.

I think, with the `skip` flag, we should totally skip the terraform.tfvars it self (or it's evaluation in the current context).
***

**brikis98** commented *May 20, 2019*

Oh, I gotcha, thanks for the explanation. Right now, the processing of interpolations such as `find_in_parent_folders` happens hand-in-hand with reading the config file itself, so the `find_in_parent_folders` function returns an error before we've even gotten to the `skip` check. 

PR to improve this behavior is welcome!
***

**barryib** commented *Jun 4, 2019*

@brikis98 I'll be happy to help on this. But I was wondering if you can point me the best place to start.

Should I skip interpolations [here](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/config/config_helpers.go#L73) ? If yes, this won't break merge and includes ?
***

**brikis98** commented *Jun 5, 2019*

@barryib Thx for the offer. You may want to hold off a bit until https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/466 is resolved, as that will change interpolation processing quite a bit.

**aperigault** commented *Jun 21, 2019*

Hi,
now it's time to fix this really annoying issue.
@brikis98 is @barryib in the right way ?

**dudicoco** commented *Dec 31, 2019*

Hi,

I'm experiencing a similar issue with skip = true in the child terragrunt.hcl files not working due to missing yaml files in the directory.

The folloeinh is defined in the root inputs block:
```
inputs = merge(
  yamldecode(
    file("${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/../global/global-values_${get_env("ENVIRONMENT", "")}.yaml"),
  ),
  yamldecode(
    file("${get_terragrunt_dir()}/values_${get_env("ENVIRONMENT", "")}.yaml"),
  )
)
```

Any ideas how to solve this?
Thanks
***

**brikis98** commented *Jan 5, 2020*

Use [fileexists](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/functions/fileexists.html) and a conditional (`COND ? TRUEVAL : FALSEVAL`) to only read the file in if it exists?
***

**dudicoco** commented *Jan 6, 2020*

Thanks @brikis98.
I've already done something similar in the child terragrunt.hcl file:
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/989#issuecomment-569991611
I was also thinking of moving the fileexists conditional to the main terragrunt.hcl file, might give it a try.
***

**dudicoco** commented *Jan 6, 2020*

Actually I think I would still need to fileexists conditional in the child terragrunt.hcl for the skip function.

**jacksonporter** commented *Aug 7, 2020*

Has there been progress on this issue? This is a blocker on DRYing up my terragrunt configurations.
***

**xgt001** commented *Feb 10, 2021*

can you please expand the current documentation around the `skip = true` functionality to mention the current gotchas of its conflicts with other interpolation functions ? Atleast per the [documentation here](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#skip) it looks like `skip` is supposed to skip the module execution entirely unless the children include it 

I have a config of something like this

```
skip = true
terraform {
  source = "../modules/vpc"
}

locals {
  region_mapping = {
    bar = {
      vpc_key = "a"
    },
    foo = {
      vpc_key = "a"
    }
    common = {
      vpc_key = "a"
    }
  }

  parsed_path = try(regex(".*/configs/(?P<account>.*?)/(?P<region>.*?)/(?P<module>.*)", abspath(".")), {
    account = "common"
    region  = "us-east-1"
    module  = "vpc-outputs"
  })
  account        = local.parsed_path.account
  region_name    = local.parsed_path.region
  module         = local.parsed_path.module
  account_config = try(read_terragrunt_config("${get_terragrunt_dir()}/../../account.hcl"), read_terragrunt_config("../../foo/account.hcl"))
  account_id     = local.account_config.locals.account_id
}

inputs = {
  vpc_key = local.region_mapping[local.account].vpc_key
}

#include the provider settings
generate "provider" {
  path      = "provider.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  contents  = <<EOF
    provider "aws" {
      region = "${local.region_name}"

    }
    EOF
}
```

Coupled with a folder structure of 
```
.
├── terragrunt.hcl
└── configs/
    ├── common/
    │   └── vpc-outputs/
    │       └── terragrunt.hcl - only for DRY
    ├── account/
    │   ├── region/
    │   │   ├── cluster/
    │   │   │   └── terragrunt.hcl
    │   │   ├── vpc-outputs/
    │   │   │   └── terragrunt.hcl - I want this to execute
    │   │   └── terragrunt.hcl
    │   └── terragrunt.hcl
    └── terragrunt.hcl
```

Without the `try` safeguards, the hcl was still getting evaluated with `run-all plan` and breaking due to skip not working. Looks like from @brikis98 's remark https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/704#issuecomment-492618513  , it seems to be failing due to the directory functions I am invoking?

Also - please do let me know if I am trying something wrong :)

**GreasyAvocado** commented *Mar 8, 2022*

Are there any plans to implement this (making `skip=true` actually skip the module altogether)?
***

**velkovb** commented *Aug 3, 2022*

I am experiencing the same issue. Are there any plans on revisiting this?

At least an update in the documentation about this issue and possible workaround would be great.
***

**perplexa** commented *Feb 19, 2023*

@velkovb I use the following as workaround:

```
find . -iname terragrunt.hcl -not -path '*/.*/*' -print0 | xargs -0 grep -L '^skip *= *true' | tr '\n' '\0' | xargs -0 -n 1 -I % -- sh -c 'cd "$(dirname "%")" && terragrunt plan'
```

While it is not ideal, at least it works.

Ran into this dealing with a couple conditionally-skipped modules.

My problem was that I have two modules that I only want to run when I'm planning/applying my production environment. Otherwise, these are ignored. The first skipped module creates a resource, and the second skipped module depends on outputs of the first. I've gotten around it by conditionally including "apply" for `mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands` in the dependency block in the second skipped module so that it would get far enough to evaluate that it actually just needs to skip the module.

e.g.:
```hcl
skip = local.env == "prod" ? false : true

  ...

locals {
  environment_vars = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("${get_env("TF_VAR_env")}_variables.hcl"))
  env = local.environment_vars.locals.env
}

dependency "foo" {
  config_path = "some/path/to/another/skipped/module"

  mock_outputs = {
    host = "foo.bar.com"
  }

  mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands = local.env == "prod" ? ["validate", "plan", "providers", "init"] : ["validate", "plan", "providers", "init", "apply"]
}

inputs = {
  hostname = dependency.foo.outputs.host
}
```

The basic problem is that skip isn't checked until all the expressions are evaluated, which makes sense since you may need some of those expressions evaluated to set `skip` given its purpose. Not sure there's a good way to actually fix it unless you just trace the values for the `skip` directive, eval those eagerly, then do the rest if you need to.

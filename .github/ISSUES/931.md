# Review Documentation and introduce more structure

**reegnz** commented *Oct 30, 2019*

This is more of an observation, but I would be very much open to help out here.

The current docs in a single `README.md` are just overwhelming and feel very cluttered. There is no possibility for a beginner to get a good high-level feel of the capabilities then drill down into the nitty-gritty details of how to use the more advanced features. I worked with terragrunt for 8 months now, so most of the features are not surprising, but some of it I figured out by trial and error because the docs were too overwhelming to use as a simple reference.

To improve the situation a bit, I would suggest splitting the docs into multiple markdown files (chapters), maybe even create a github-pages documentation page out of them.

As a next step the high-level low-level reorganization of the docs could be tried.

Alternatives:
I have to write my own 'terragrunt howto docs' in my own space which I very much would like to avoid and improve the docs right here in the upstream instead.

Thanks for the feedback. We know the docs are overwhelming and not very beginner friendly, and the community knows too (https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/530 and https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/220). It is on our roadmap to overhaul the docs, but we've been focusing on improving the core features of terragrunt first.

We are still very open to (and will appreciate) PRs that overhaul the docs from the community!

Since this is a duplicate though, will be closing in favor of https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/530. Please continue the conversation there.

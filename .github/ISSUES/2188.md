# Terragrunt prompting for https clone credentials despite being told to specifically use ssh

**B1T3X** commented *Jul 12, 2022*

Hi,
I've been breaking my teeth on this one for a few weeks now.
I'm trying to reference a module in a private self-hosted GitLab repository by specifying the source as such:
`source = "git::ssh://git@************/username/reponame.git//path/to/module?ref=master"`
(Yes, the branch name is master, rather than main)

The following prompt I get:
`Password for 'https://git@***********':`

Anyone managed to solve this?
I'm pulling my hairs out and can't find anything like this issue or a solution anywhere.

Thanks in advance, Orel

Hi, 
try `git::git@gitlab.com:...`

More details:

```
...
Complete Example:
...
terraform {
  source = "git::git@...
}
...
```

Here's what I get now:
```
ERRO[0000] 1 error occurred:

I think this might actually be because you have a `git config` entry that replaces SSH URLs with HTTPS URLs. When you do `git config -l`, do you have any entry that looks like the following?

```
url.https://gitlab.com.insteadOf=ssh://git@gitlab.com
```

This is so incredibly awkward. That was the issue. Thank you so much and I apologize.

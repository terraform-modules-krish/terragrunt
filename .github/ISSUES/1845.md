# path_relative_to_include() used with run_cmd() in locals broken in 0.34.0

**tjstansell** commented *Oct 4, 2021*

We use `path_relative_to_include()` to try to set some local variables.  In `0.34.0` this breaks because those local evaluations appear to be happening multiple times now, and `path_relative_to_include()` is passing in a path of `.` the second time instead of the correct path.

Here's a stub test directory:

```
root@e2e02e6012b4:/app# cat terragrunt-test.hcl
locals {
  path = run_cmd("echo", "path_relative_to_inclue:", path_relative_to_include())
}

generate "test" {
  path      = "test.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"

  contents = <<-EOF
    # local.path: ${local.path}
  EOF
}
```
```
root@e2e02e6012b4:/app# cat test/test1/test2/terragrunt.hcl
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders("terragrunt-test.hcl")
}
```

When run using `0.33.2` we see the locals only evaluating once:
```

But running with `0.34.0` results in a second call with just `.` as the relative path (which breaks our `run_cmd()` script):
```

Interestingly, the `test.tf` file that's generated uses the correct first path in both cases:
```
root@e2e02e6012b4:/app/test/test1/test2# cat test.tf
# Generated by Terragrunt. Sig: nIlQXj57tbuaRZEa
# local.path: path_relative_to_inclue: test/test1/test2
```

But that's only because the `run_cmd()` here doesn't fail on the `.` being passed in.

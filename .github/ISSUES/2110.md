# Terragrunt console command hangs

**dudicoco** commented *May 16, 2022*

Hi,

When running `terragrunt console`, terragrunt just seems to hang forever:
```sh
$ terragrunt console
Acquiring state lock. This may take a few moments...
```

I'm pretty sure the command used to work in the past, possibly a newer release broke it.

Installed versions:
```hcl
terragrunt_version_constraint = "= v0.36.6"
terraform_version_constraint  = "= 1.1.8"
```

Found the issue, had to do with my local config.

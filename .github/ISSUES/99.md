# path_relative_to_include() helper should be OS agnostic

**brikis98** commented *Jan 12, 2017*

The `path_relative_to_include()` returns the path between a root and a child `.terragrunt` file. This is typically used to set the `state_file_id` and `key` settings. The problem is that on *nix systems, this path will contain forward slashes, whereas on Windows, for the same path, it will contain backslashes. Therefore, the locking and state file storage won't work properly if team members use different operating systems.

`path_relative_to_include` should probably enforce forward slashes on all OS's.

This was fixed by #100.

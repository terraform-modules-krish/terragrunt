# Add `update-variable` feature

**rhoboat** commented *Nov 1, 2021*

This idea came from realizing from [this issue](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-ci/issues/197) that [hcledit has a bug](https://github.com/minamijoyo/hcledit/issues/28). 

As a workaround, we could implement something like `terragrunt update-variable --set 'locals.image.tag=foo' /path/to/terragrunt.hcl`. We could also make terragrunt support the logic for `tfvars` files as well.

# Proposal of a new function get_root_dir

**dmlemos** commented *Oct 4, 2017*

## Problem

Suppose I have a structure like this:
```
terraform
└ modules
  └ app1
  └ ...

app1
└ config
└ infra
  └ terraform.tfvars
```

app1/infra/terraform.tfvars
```
terragrunt = {
  terraform {
    source = "${get_env("TF_MODULES_DIR", "")}/app1"
  }
}
```

Assuming `TF_MODULES_DIR=terraform/modules`. If I try to run `terragrunt` it will complain that location doesn't exist.

## Proposal

I would like to propose a new function to find the root directory of the repository (assuming it stops when it finds the `.git` folder I guess), like this:
```
terragrunt = {
  terraform {
    source = "${get_root_dir()}/${get_env("TF_MODULES_DIR", "")}/app1"
  }
}
```

I could use the same proposed function to use in the include block as well:
```
terragrunt = {
  include = {
    path = "${get_root_dir()}/${get_env("TF_BACKEND_CONFIG", "")}"
  }

   ...
}
```

Since each folder represents an app/stack I cannot simple use the `find_in_parent_folders()`

`TF_BACKEND_CONFIG=config/terraform.tfvars`
`config/terraform.tfvars`
```
terragrunt = {
  remote_state {
    backend = "s3"

    config {
      region         = "${get_env("AWS_REGION", "")}"
      bucket         = "${get_env("TF_BUCKET", "")}"
      key            = "${get_env("TF_STACK"), "")}/terraform.tfstate"
      encrypt        = true
      dynamodb_table = "${get_env("TF_DYNAMODB_TABLE", "")}"
    }
  }

  ...
}
```

Finally example workflow:
```sh
(make exports variables)
$ stack=app1 make deploy

(make workflow)
cd app1/infra
terragrunt plan && terragrunt apply
```


I am using this workflow for a project. Right now I have generate the configs with scripts.

Would [get_parent_tfvars_dir()](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt#get_parent_tfvars_dir) work?
***

**dmlemos** commented *Oct 4, 2017*

@brikis98 Unfortunately no. Result is empty.

**brikis98** commented *Oct 4, 2017*

Put a `terraform.tfvars` file in the root.

**dmlemos** commented *Oct 4, 2017*

Doesn't work with `terraform.tfvars` in the root folder :disappointed:
Always gets the current_path `app1/infra` as opposed to `/`.

Does the top `terraform.tfvars` file need to contain something for it to detect?

**brikis98** commented *Oct 5, 2017*

I think in the child `terraform.tfvars`, you need to [include](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt#keep-your-remote-state-configuration-dry) the root `terraform.tfvars` file.

```hcl
terragrunt = {
  include {
    path = "${find_in_parent_folders()}"
  }
}
```

The `${find_in_parent_folders()}` works fine, but then the functions to resolve to the caller path don't work.

For now I have a function in the makefile that translates the ancestor path from the caller to dot notation and pass the full path as env.

`app1/infra/terraform.tfvars`
```
"${get_tfvars_dir()}/${get_env("TF_MODULES_DIR", "")}/consul"
```

resolves to `TF_MODULES_DIR="../../terraform/modules"`

Stumbled across this while looking for something else, but this might be closable - `get_parent_terragrunt_dir()` does this, unless I'm greatly mistaken.

I think this is asking for getting the root of the git repository, which may not always be `get_parent_terragrunt_dir`. E.g in a monorepo where the modules and the live config is combined, your tree might look like the following:

```
.
├── live
│   └── account
│       ├── region
│       │   ├── env
│       │   │   ├── terragrunt.hcl
│       │   │   └── vpc
│       │   │       └── terragrunt.hcl
│       │   └── terragrunt.hcl
│       └── terragrunt.hcl
└── modules
    └── app
        └── main.tf
```

The proposed function would return the root of this tree, instead of `./live`, which is what `get_parent_terragrunt_dir` would return.

That’s I believe covered by #2027 ?

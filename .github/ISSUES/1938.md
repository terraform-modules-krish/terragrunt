# Error `There is no variable named "dependency"` when using dependency in `Skip =`.

We tend to use dependency outputs with Skip =. This was working with terragrunt version =< v0.31.5

An example of where we use a dependency value with Skip:
```hcl
dependency "cluster" {
  config_path                   = "../cluster"
  mock_outputs_merge_with_state = true
  mock_outputs = {
    cluster_name                        = "mocked"
  }
}

skip = dependency.cluster.outputs.cluster_name == "mocked"
```
We are provisioning an EKS cluster and want to skip the current "config" module being called on the first ever plan. The config module expects a cluster to be present and accessible so that it can populate the provider credentials for kubernetes and helm.

The error I am experiencing with version `v0.35.13` is `Unknown variable; There is no variable named "dependency".`

You can't recursively introspect a `dependency` in a `dependency` block.

Note that the way you wrote it also has a chicken-and-egg problem. The `skip` flag means skip pulling the dependency, but in order for terragrunt to know whether or not to skip, it has to fetch the dependency output. So even if we did support recursive look ups, it's not clear what terragrunt should do, because it can't decided whether to skip fetching outputs until it has fetched outputs.

The [skip](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#skip) in my example is outside the dependency and not within the dependency block. 

Using debug logging, from version  =< v0.31.5 I noticed the outputs will be retrieved
```
DEBU[0000] Getting output of dependency
```
It seems in previous versions the output from the dependencies were being retrieved in the skip block. Still trying to find the change in behaviour in recent releases.

This would be useful for us as well. In our case, we have a Terraform module that deploys a HashiCorp Vault instance. It runs an external data source that inits Vault and returns the root token. We then have a separate module that installs configuration in Vault.

When running in reverse order in destroy-all, it will work the first time, but then get stuck if run again, because the Vault provider is being configured with `dependency.vault.outputs.root_token`, which is blank if the vault module has been destroyed.

It would be useful to be able to
```hcl
skip = ! contains(dependency.vault.outputs, "root_token)
```
but when I try, I get

```
Unknown variable; There is no variable named "dependency"., and 1 other diagnostic(s)
```

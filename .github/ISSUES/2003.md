# Terragrunt cannot download module from 3rd party registry: 404

**atikhono** commented *Jan 31, 2022*

Hi, I'm facing an issue with tfr source when using a 3rd party Terraform registry implementation.
Module `/download` URL returns `X-Terraform-Get: ./archive.tar.gz`. The implementation in Terragrunt is not corrent: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/internal/tfr/getter.go#L251. The comments in the code are good, but the code does not do what it's supposed to, ie does not prepend base module path for relative X-Terraform-Get values. This must be `fmt.Sprintf("%v://%v%v", url.Scheme, url.Host, path.Join(url.Path, "..", terraformGet))` for `./` and `/`.

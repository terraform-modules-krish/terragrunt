# hard lock of "TERRAFORM_COMMANDS_NEED_LOCKING"

**ozbillwang** commented *Feb 14, 2019*

Dig the usage of `get_terraform_commands_that_need_locking()`, and it has hardcodes with variable `TERRAFORM_COMMANDS_NEED_LOCKING`

https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/968cf5b2dca606339eabeeaf407732ed34eac9f4/config/config_helpers.go#L25-L34

So my question is, why add `plan` in it?

It doesn't make sense for me to lock the tfstate file, when run with `terraform plan`, it is a dry-run command, no resource will be changed when it is running.

It's based on the actual behavior of Terraform:

```
$ terraform plan --help
Usage: terraform plan [options] [DIR-OR-PLAN]

  Generates an execution plan for Terraform.

  This execution plan can be reviewed prior to running apply to get a
  sense for what Terraform will do. Optionally, the plan can be saved to
  a Terraform plan file, and apply can take this plan file to execute
  this plan exactly.

  If a saved plan is passed as an argument, this command will output
  the saved plan contents. It will not modify the given plan.

Options:

  -destroy            If set, a plan will be generated to destroy all resources
                      managed by the given configuration and state.

  -detailed-exitcode  Return detailed exit codes when the command exits. This
                      will change the meaning of exit codes to:
                      0 - Succeeded, diff is empty (no changes)
                      1 - Errored
                      2 - Succeeded, there is a diff

  -input=true         Ask for input for variables if not directly set.

  -lock=true          Lock the state file when locking is supported.
```

Note that `-lock=true` is the default for the `plan` command.

# Refactoring creation of S3 bucket as part of Initialize 

**ina-stoyanova** commented *Oct 28, 2020*

**Context:**
[As part of this PR](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1400) a change was introduced to refactor some duplication resulting from the newly added logic to create Logs S3 Bucket. 

As of the PR above, we have some duplicated logic in both `createS3BucketIfNecessary` and `CreateLogsS3BucketIfNecessary`. 

**Risks of duplicated code:**
- That essentially makes it harder for us to read & maintain this piece of code. It introduces the code to future contributors "why is this different?"
- It might also cause confusion in future contributions
**Risks of refactoring suggested in [this commit](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1400/commits/8999485370d9e0e1edba8bde29af11589bb89861):**
- potentially breaking change in current terragrunt initiliazation routine 
- see more in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1400#discussion_r513017599


**Related commits:**
- [original commit](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1400/commits/8999485370d9e0e1edba8bde29af11589bb89861) introducing the breaking behaviour (moving the `DoesS3BucketExist` into the `CreateS3Bucket` func) 
- [commit ](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1400/commits/8fb08a3ad6d34710b76b520ccb352a9ecea07116) reverting the above, so it can be extracted into this issue & looked as a separate enhancement

**Ways forward:**
1. _(potentially easiest & least effort)_ - Accept the duplication and accept the risks that comes with; add comments to explain it 
2. _(medium risk)_ - Refactor the duplication using higher-order functions 
     - _when tried previously, that seemed to cause the code to be more unclear and unreadable_
3. _(highest risk)_ - Go forward with the suggested changes & test what the impact to existing Terragrunt configs and users will be

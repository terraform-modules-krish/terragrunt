# Feature request: terragrunt apply for subset of all modules

**camlow325** commented *Oct 29, 2020*

We have structured our Terragrunt configuration per the [Execute Terraform commands on multiple modules at once](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/execute-terraform-commands-on-multiple-modules-at-once/) documentation so that we can build a full environment with a single `terraform apply-all` command from the root configuration directory and take advantage of Terragrunt's excellent parallelism support.

Using that same base configuration, we also have a need for users to create environments which have a subset of the available modules in our app (e.g., for more focused subsystem testing). We could just serially run `terragrunt apply` for each module which needs to be applied, but that would cause the environment creation time to be much slower than with parallel builds. We could also (assuming that would work) try to run multiple `terragrunt apply` commands in parallel, but that would be harder to coordinate and would lead to some redundant work being done per `terragrunt` executable being run. Instead, our current approach involves creating a temporary working directory which contains the subset of modules that needs to be applied and then running `terragrunt apply-all` from that directory.

Our current approach works, but it would be great if Terragrunt had a built-in CLI option for applying a subset of modules to be applied. Maybe there would be a good case to have something like this for other Terraform-wrapped commands as well (e.g., `plan` or `destroy`)?

For example, assume we have a directory structure like this, where none of the modules have Terragrunt-level dependencies upon one another:

```
root
|-- foo
|-- bar
|-- baz
```

It would be nice to be able to run something like this from the "root" directory and have Terragrunt do an apply of the "foo" and "bar" modules but not the "baz" module:

> terragrunt apply-multiple --terragrunt-module foo --terragrunt-module bar

Not sure what the best way to specify this from the command line would be. Maybe others would have better ideas?

Does [terragrunt-include-dir](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli-options/#terragrunt-include-dir) do the trick for you? You will also want to be aware of the related flags:

- [terragrunt-exclude-dir](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli-options/#terragrunt-exclude-dir)
- [terragrunt-strict-include](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli-options/#terragrunt-strict-include)
- [terragrunt-ignore-external-dependencies](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli-options/#terragrunt-ignore-external-dependencies)

Ah, that's perfect. ðŸ’¯ Sorry I missed that in the documentation earlier. Thanks for the quick feedback on this!

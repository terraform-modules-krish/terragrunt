# Multi Level Before/After Hooks

**vaibhavkhurana2018** commented *Jun 3, 2021*

I have a use case where i want to run hooks at the root level and then at individual env level. The structure looks like below:

.
|-- prod
|   |-- vpc
|   |   `-- terragrunt.hcl
|   `-- terragrunt.hcl
|-- qa
|   |-- vpc
|   |   `-- terragrunt.hcl
|   `-- terragrunt.hcl
|-- stage
|   |-- vpc
|   |   `-- terragrunt.hcl
|   `-- terragrunt.hcl
`-- terragrunt.hcl

What i want to is have hooks configured on the root level terragrunt.hcl and other configurations along with env specific hooks in the respective environment directories. 

When trying this, i am getting the error Only one level of includes is allowed, which is also described in some other issues as well. But the issue talks over passing other variables but i am not able to do similar things with hooks. Can someone let me know if this is possible or some other approach to do this?

If you're getting an error about one level of includes, it's not about hooks, but about `include { ... }` blocks. Right now, Terragrunt only allows one level: i.e., a child with an include pointing at a parent. That parent cannot also have an `include { ... }` pointing at yet another parent.

Closing as duplicate of https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/303. Please follow that ticket if you are interested in that feature.

Side note, we now support multiple include blocks for a single level, which might be a viable workaround. Refer to [the terragrunt docs on the feature](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/keep-your-terragrunt-architecture-dry/) for more info.

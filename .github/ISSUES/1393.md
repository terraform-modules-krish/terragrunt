# Move to terraform-exec under the hood?

**brikis98** commented *Oct 19, 2020*

There is now a dedicated library from HashiCorp called [`terraform-exec`](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-exec) that can be used to programmatically execute the `terraform` CLI. Perhaps Terragrunt should use that under the hood?

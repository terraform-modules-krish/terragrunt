# Feature request: skip_bucket_creation, skip_dynamodb_creation for s3 backend (like GCS)

**gtmtech** commented *Apr 25, 2021*

I've used terragrunt against gcs successfully, and used the skip_bucket_creation option for a gcs backend. 

However this option is not available for s3 backend. Instead terragrunt runs interactively and asks the question if I want the bucket or not. 

I am not allowed to grant terragrunt the ability to manage buckets directly, because I work in a highly permissioned environment where terragrunt has no permissions to manage data storage, and making buckets must be part of terraform through an assigned storage manager role. (I get no choice over this as- you know- banking). And also, there are highly strict requirements about bucket configurations, so i cannot just accept the terragrunt defaults that terragrunt comes up with even though there are feature flags and options to configure some items, its just not granular enough. 

It would be really useful if terragrunt had the option to skip trying to want to manage buckets and dynamodb tables so that I can just do it in terraform instead for the s3 backend. There seems to already be precedent in this for a GCS backend, where you can skip creation (which we do for the GCS cloud)

I dont want s3 buckets to be inadvertently created before the permissions structure is setup and then have to do terraform imports and then change the configuration, or worse still, have to delete and recreate the bucket and wait the 24h turnaround time.

Thanks!

Adding support for `skip_bucket_creation` to S3 would be consistent, but perhaps for your use case, you should [disable auto-init](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli-options/#terragrunt-no-auto-init)?

Hey guys, I would like this feature too. I would like my terragrunt commands to fail if the s3 bucket isn't created yet.

@brikis98 I tried doing `terragrunt init --terragrunt-no-auto-init` and it still asked me if I wanted to create the bucket.

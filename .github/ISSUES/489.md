# Add "prevent destroy" to Terragrunt

**brikis98** commented *Jun 14, 2018*

Terragrunt should support a `prevent_destroy` flag that, if set to `true`, will prevent `terraform destroy` from being executed. This is useful for modules you want to carefully protect, such as a database, or a module that provides auth (which isn't a "dependency" of other modules, but if you delete it, you won't be able to access anything else!).

```hcl
terragrunt = {
  prevent_destroy = true
}
```

# Add support to include tfvars only for `apply`s without plan output files

**dmattia** commented *Dec 20, 2019*

Right now, writing code such as

```hcl
terraform {
  extra_arguments "common_var" {
    commands  = get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars()
    arguments = ["-var-file=${get_aws_account_id()}.tfvars"]
  }
}
```

will work with a `terragrunt apply`, as `apply` is listed here: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/7f563c6fe3abe41764aff642f01edc180288a9af/config/config_helpers.go#L33

However, running a `terragrunt plan -out plan` and then `terragrunt apply plan` will fail because you are passing tfvars to an `apply` that already knows what it's doing.

Likewise, if you set: `commands = ["plan"]` you will get the reverse problem. You will be able to use plan files, but unable to not use plan files.

It would be great if terragrunt could figure out for `apply` commands if the `tfvars` should be included or not based on the other arguments passed to the `apply`.

This makes sense, although I would be worried about the element of surprise. PR is very welcome! Would love to see some RFC or docs updates first to understand if this can be implemented in a way that is intuitive and maintainable.

Hey I am running into this issue as well.

It would be super useful to see this get resolved~

From what I can tell on Terragrunt 0.21.11, this is not an issue. When you call `apply` with a plan file, it removes all arguments starting with "-var" or "-var-file". This is a problem for me because I pass `["-var", "foo=bar"]` and it ends up calling terraform with just `foo=bar`, so I have to use the form `-var=foo=bar` to make it correctly remove that when the apply is called with a plan.

Thanks @ayqazi, I will look into this today. I had been using terragrunt version v0.21.9.

It doesn't seem like anything in the release logs points to changes with how these vars are handled, but I will report back once I'm using the latest version

FYI This is still an issue, as we haven't addressed the flip-flop problem with plan and apply args.

I'm still having that problem with terragrunt version v0.35.4.

I load my tfvars files this way:

```hcl
locals {
  #...
  base_path = basename(get_terragrunt_dir())
}

terraform {
  extra_arguments "fixtures" {
    commands = get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars()

    optional_var_files = [
      "${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/fixtures.tfvars",
      "${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/fixtures.${local.environment}.tfvars",
      "${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/${local.base_path}.tfvars",
      "${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/${local.base_path}.${local.environment}.tfvars"
    ]
  }
}
```

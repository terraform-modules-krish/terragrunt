# Question: How to import to module using terragrunt?

**christiansaiki** commented *Jan 25, 2021*

Hey guys I've created this [question in SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65878969/how-to-import-to-module-using-terragrunt)

I'm wondering if this is the correct approach, to import to module. Because if I import to resource it just works, but I'm wondering what's the difference between these two approaches and what's the correct one.

Thanks in advance.

I think this is a Terraform knowledge question, not a Terragrunt question. I added a comment on SO to help.

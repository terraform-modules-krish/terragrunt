# Terraform errors are swallowed with default log level and run-all

**apottere** commented *Feb 4, 2021*

With the new logging behavior in `v0.28`, errors in the terraform are no longer being logged when using `run-all`.  Example:

```
$ terragrunt plan

Error: "warning.0.threshold_duration" must be a factor of 60, got: 90

  on alerts.tf line 50, in resource "newrelic_nrql_alert_condition" "p99-threshold":
  50: resource "newrelic_nrql_alert_condition" "p99-threshold" {


ERRO[0005] Hit multiple errors:
Hit multiple errors:
exit status 1 
```
```
$ terragrunt run-all plan
ERRO[0005] Encountered the following errors:
Hit multiple errors:
Hit multiple errors:
exit status 1 
```

Upon further inspection, it looks like all of the initialization logs are hidden with `run-all` as well.

Odd. We'll get this fixed.

# Terragrunt creating a main.tf file in cache that includes two modules.

I'm having a really strange issue with terragrunt. When I run an apply, I notice that terragrunt is combining two of my modules into one main.tf file causing resource conflicts...

My modules exist in a separate repo in this hierarchy:
```
|
|__services
            |__lambda
                     |__signal
                     |__sdata
```

When applying against the sdata module, it runs no problem but when I run against signal it seems to also take the sdata module into account.. Any idea whats happening here?

# Terragrunt Plan requiring a real value for mock_outputs with resource azurerm_windows_function_app

**bdorplatt** commented *Oct 19, 2022*

Running a plan against the new **azurerm_windows_function_app** resource results in the error below and will not accept a mock output and continue. The exact same setup with the deprecated **azurerm_function_app** works as expected and honors the mock values. Based on the error details, it appears the new resource requires actually seeing what tier the service plan is on and it can't get that from a mock value. Both tests were performed using the **azurerm_service_plan** resource for the app service plan.

**Error: could not read new Service Plan to check tier Service Plan: (Serverfarm Name "mock-asp" / Resource Group "mock-rg"): web.AppServicePlansClient#Get: Failure responding to request: StatusCode=404 -- Original Error: autorest/azure: Service returned an error. Status=404 Code="ResourceGroupNotFound" Message="Resource group 'mock-rg' could not be found."**

A plan does run successfully when using the resource ID of an existing App Service Plan (actual resource existing in Azure) entered as the mock output in the terragrunt.hcl of the Function app. For reference: [https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/issues/17376](url)

Since the whole point of mock outputs is to not have resources already existing, an adjustment to how Terragrunt handles this resource type will probably be needed. We shouldn't have to use a real value for a mock output. While using a real ASP ID is a sort of workaround, it isn't sustainable since if the referenced App Service Plan is deleted, the code will be broken. This also doesn't work if the app is being deployed in a new subscription or a subscription that doesn't have any App Service Plans deployed yet.

Also of note, using any of the 3 options for **mock_outputs_merge_strategy_with_state**, results in the same: **Error: could not read new Service Plan to check tier Service Plan**

resource "azurerm_windows_function_app" "function_app" {

Hi,
I suspect existing resource ID should be imported to Terraform state to be picked correctly during Terragrunt execution

We are not working with existing infrastructure here that needs to be imported. These are net new deployments that need the mock outputs to work without requiring real resources to exist in advance.

Seeing the same issue.

**bargokr** commented *Nov 4, 2022*

any update to this? we are seeing this issue as well and it is a massive pain point when deploying to different subscriptions.
***

**bargokr** commented *Jan 5, 2023*

bump - this is a priority for our organization. Is anyone actively working to resolve this?

now ran into the same issue cant execute terragrunt run-all plan to actually deploy a service function without an existing deployment

Same here: 2 folders deployment, a secret for secret manager is created into the first folder, the second folder terrafrom is supposed to read it and use it into an RDS deployment, mock value added as part of outputs from the first folder:

```
Error: Secrets Manager Secret "mock-secret" not found
```
(`mock-secret` is the name of the secret set as output mock)

 @denis256 Could you take a second look at this? I believe this was originally misdiagnosed as something needing to be imported.
These are net new deployments that need the mock outputs to work without requiring real resources to exist in advance.

Most recently, one of the "real" app service plans that we had our mock outputs pointing to as a workaround was decommissioned. This resulted in further deployments failing until we pointed the mock output to another "real" ASP.

We need to be able to use a dummy value instead of a real resource ID of an existing resource. That is the entire purpose of mock outputs and they are not working here as they work with every other resource we have deployed thus far. 

Instead of a real value, we need to be able to do this:
mock_outputs = {
asp_id = "/subscriptions/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111/resourceGroups/mockrg/providers/Microsoft.Web/serverfarms/mockasp"
}

I'm experiencing the same issue, please fix.

Hi, 
can be shared example code/repository where this issue happens?
***

**bdorplatt** commented *Jul 24, 2023*

We don't have the code in a public repo but the example provided should hopefully be enough to reproduce:

**Function App resource: Main.tf**
resource "azurerm_windows_function_app" "function_app" {
app_settings = var.fa_app_settings
location = var.region
name = "test-azf"
resource_group_name = var.resource_group_name
service_plan_id = var.fa_service_plan_id
}

**Dependency and Input: Terragrunt.hcl**
include {
path = find_in_parent_folders()
}
dependency "app_service_plan01" {
config_path = "../../appserviceplan/appserviceplan01"
mock_outputs = {
asp_id = "/subscriptions/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111/resourceGroups/mockrg/providers/Microsoft.Web/serverfarms/mockasp"
}
mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands = ["validate", "plan"]
mock_outputs_merge_strategy_with_state = "shallow"
}

inputs = {
fa_service_plan_id = dependency.app_service_plan01.outputs.asp_id
}

# [question] How to limit the deployment to nominated account id

**ozbillwang** commented *Nov 15, 2019*

I managed the terragrunt stacks for acoss aws accounts with assume role. I found it is annoying that some developers deploy the services to wrong account id. 

I'd like to know how you deal with this situation. 

I 'd like to set the limits as below way.

```
<account_id>/<region>/<environment>/<service_name>/terragrunt.hcl
<account_id>/_global/<environment>/<service_name>/terragrunt.hcl

```

in a real case, for example, it will be 
```
123456789012/us-east-1/dev/ecs/terragrunt.hcl
```
Ideally this stack should be only deployed to aws account `123456789012`, So how can I stop the developers to deploy this stack to other account? any easy way?

We utilize the `allowed_account_ids` within the AWS provider and simply pass in the account via variable to the Terraform config.

Thanks, @jakauppila 

Do you mean this 
```
provider "aws" {
  allowed_account_ids = var.aws_allowed_accounts_ids
  region              = var.aws_region
}
```
when I feed in `terragrunt.hcl`, just set 

```
inputs = {
  aws_allowed_accounts_ids = ["123456789012"]
  ...
}
```

This is real cool. :+1: .

@jakauppila 

The suggestion looks great. But when I work on real codes. it doesn't work as expect. 

Whatever I set the variable `aws_allowed_accounts_ids` with wrong IDs or set to `empty, the apply command deploy the changes successfully. 

Can you share me the codes in this part for reference?

You can rely on directory structure to feed the account ID variable automatically by setting the `aws_allowed_account_ids` variable in a root `terragrunt.hcl` file that is included by child directories. E.g have `aws_allowed_account_ids` show up in [the root terragrunt.hcl file for the account](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example/blob/master/prod/terragrunt.hcl).

This has the benefits of defaulting to the right account and adding extra steps to override it (you have to edit another file that you don't normally touch on a day to day basis to deploy to a different account).

I played with running terragrunt using a rake task with a validator in: https://github.com/dinocorp/webs-infra/blob/master/lib/tasks/terragrunt.rake#L91

See the output here: https://github.com/dinocorp/webs-infra/blob/master/ACTUAL_README.md#devex

This was an example repo to stimulate debate a few months back. A step in the right direction from where the team were at the time.

Closing as a few workarounds and suggestions have been provided for how to solve this. In addition to this, there is also now a way to handle this purely in `terragrunt` using [generate blocks](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/keep-your-terraform-code-dry/#dry-common-terraform-code-with-terragrunt-generate-blocks). Between all of these, I think we can consider this question answered so marking as solved.

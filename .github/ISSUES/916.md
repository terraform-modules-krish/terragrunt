```hcl
terragrunt = {
  terraform {
    source = "..."
    exclude_from_copy = [".terraform", ".git"]
  }
}
```

Is there any update on that or functionality working currently in Terragrunt to do something similar? I simply want to exclude a couple of folders from being copied to the cache.

Hi, this feature isn't implemented yet. We are currently buried at the moment and unlikely to get to this anytime soon, but would be happy to review a PR that adds this functionality!

# new terragrunt feature to update remote states bucket raises an error

Hi,

We just upgraded to v0.37.1, and we have the following error :

```

```

in order to get rid of it, we are using `skip_bucket_root_access = true` as a temporary measure to prevent terragrunt from updating the bucket

our remote state bucket was created by a recent version of terragrunt : 0.35.14

older remote state buckets created with much older versions of terragrunt don't have this issue and update smoothly

Woops, thought I was commenting on the issue but commented on the PR instead! Will repeat here as well:

We're experiencing this issue with one of our AWS accounts as well, and I can confirm the linked PR solves it.

And a workaround is making the existing bucket policy use a list in the Resource if it's a string (this was the case in some of our RootAccess rules) eg. change the first line to the second
```
"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::$BUCKET_NAME"

"Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::$BUCKET_NAME", "arn:aws:s3:::$BUCKET_NAME/*"]
```

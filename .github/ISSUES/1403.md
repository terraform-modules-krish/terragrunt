# Warn terragrunt users of S3 state buckets logging unintended behaviour

**ina-stoyanova** commented *Oct 26, 2020*

**Disclaimer:**
This can be done only after https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1400 has been approved & merged in.

**Context:** As part of the https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1400 PR, the `skip_bucket_access_logging` property is getting deprecated. It will no longer take effect on the server access logging for the TF State S3 bucket that's being created as part of running `terragrunt apply | plan | validate`.

As part of the deprecation, we've ensured backwards compatibility by issuing a log warning when the option is provided in the `terragrunt.hcl` config file. Moreover, the release notes (this will be a link once the release is out in the public) will be updated.

**Help is needed:**
- to extract a list of all existing TF State S3 buckets (in a given AWS account) with server access logging ON & pointed to the same origin S3 bucket
- to notify the user that this might result in a bug behaviour as described in this issue https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1333

**Implications/Risks if not done:**
For all previously run terragrunt configurations (`.hcl`) files ([after Terragrunt release v0.18.0](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.18.0)
- `skip_bucket_access_logging` = `true` => No implications
- `skip_bucket_access_logging` = `false`/Not provided
        => Access logging will be turned on 
        => Logs target bucket same as the origin bucket
        => **risk 1: potentially higher incurred costs for the S3 services**
        => **risk 2: noisy access logs [(explained in more detail here)](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1333)**

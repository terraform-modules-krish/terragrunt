# Python wrapper

**gshiva** commented *Sep 14, 2017*

Instead of using bash/shell to drive terragrunt it would be nice to use a higher level language like python.

Has anyone done a python wrapper for terragrunt?

I'm a bit confused. Where is bash/shell used with Terragrunt?

To launch terragrunt, we have to launch it from a shell right?

(Just got your book... nice work!)

Ah, yes Terragrunt is a CLI tool, so you typically run it from some sort of shell, though compiles into standalone binaries for all major OS's: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases. 

I don't think anyone had requested higher-level language bindings for it before. What's the use case?

Our scenario is as follows:

- We have moved away from bash run scripts to python after having a tough time handling errors, parsing output, code modularization and business logic in bash scripts
- Calling terragrunt via python wrapper would give us the above benefits and would fit nicely with our existing code
- Calling semantics would be "clean" and would have some static type checking
`output = terragrunt.plan(arg1, calculated arg2)`
- we have python libraries for kubernetes, consul and vault - so it would be easy to pass their info to terragrunt where appropriate

Ah, gotcha. Well, I haven't seen such a Python wrapper floating around, so you may have to build it from scratch. FWIW, calling shell commands from python is pretty darn easy: `call(["terragrunt", "plan"])`.

I know that :)

Now add to it

- timeout
- log buffer overflow
- handling weird exit codes ( terraform plan returns 0 for no changes 1 for valid plan 2 for actual error)
- parsing non-machine friendly output (which can change with new releases)

well you get the picture :)

Sorry to bump an old thread, I'm looking for the same solution for similar reasons that gshiva was.

I'm using 
`pip install awscliv2` for aws pyton api
`pip install kubernetes` for k8s python api

so far best solution I've found is to import subprocess as it provides capture of stdout, stderr etc.

    result = subprocess.run(['ls', '-la'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
    print(type(result.stdout))
    print(result.stdout)
    print(result.stderr)
    print(result.stdout.decode('utf-8'))

    print(result.returncode)

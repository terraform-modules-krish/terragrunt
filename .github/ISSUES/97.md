# Run Terragrunt tests on CI system with Windows support

**brikis98** commented *Jan 10, 2017*

Currently, we only run our automated tests in CircleCI, which supports Linux. As a result, we have bugs in Windows, and many of our tests fail on Windows.

We should add the ability to run tests in a CI system that works with Windows. [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com) may be a good choice, as they have a free plan for open source projects.

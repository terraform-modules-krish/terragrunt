# Error trying to get terragrunt run-all plan after_hook to show tfplan.binary

**drey0143143** commented *Jan 20, 2022*

I have multiple environment Testing and Production ,I want to verify terragrunt run-all plan(plan) with checkov when GitHubActions workflow is triggered.I want the plan saved in tfplan.binary then converted to json so checkov can scan it.I am getting error message after the terraform run-all plan is called.Below is my code snippet and the error messages.

~~~
Terragrunt.hcl

terraform {
  extra_arguments "plan_file" {
    commands = ["plan"]
    arguments = ["-out=${get_terragrunt_dir()}/tfplan.binary"]
  }

  after_hook "after_hook_plan" {
      commands     = ["plan"]
      execute      = ["sh", "-c", "terraform show -json tfplan.binary > ${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/plan.json"]
  }
}


Actions Workflow

- name: Plan
        id: plan
        run: |
          terragrunt run-all plan  -no-color --terragrunt-non-interactive
          
      -  run: |
           pip install checkov
           checkov -d ../../
     
          
      - name: 'Test Plan (Checkov)'
        uses: bridgecrewio/checkov-action@master
        with:
          directory: ../../
          quiet: false # optional: display only failed checks
          framework: terraform # optional: run only on a specific infrastructure {cloudformation,terraform,kubernetes,all}
          output_format: json # optional: the output format, one of: cli, json, junitxml, github_failed_only

Hi, from provided logs is not clear what failed, log contains only:
```
Error running hook after_hook_plan with message: exit status 1
```

Maybe make sense to re-run with Terragrunt with `--terragrunt-log-level debug` or to download `tfplan.binary` and run manually  `terraform show -json tfplan.binary` to see if it is an issue in Terraform invocation or in Terragrunt

I believe Terragrunt isn't generating my terraform plans in a json format but instead as a binary file with the extension .json making checkov fail to parse the file since it doesn't support terraform plan binaries.
Below is my terragrunt.hcl again,not sure what I'm doing wrong
~~~
terraform {
  after_hook "after_hook_plan" {
      commands     = ["plan"]
      execute      = ["sh", "-c", "mkdir -p ${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/plans/${path_relative_to_include()}; terraform show -json tfplan.binary > ${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/plans/${path_relative_to_include()}/plan.json"]
  }
}

A configuration like bellow worked fine on my environment - json file got generated from `tfplan.binary`
Used terragrunt `0.36.0` and terraform `v1.1.0`

```
terraform {
  extra_arguments "plan_file" {
    commands = [
      "plan",
    ]
    arguments = [
      "-out=${get_terragrunt_dir()}/tfplan.binary"
    ]
  }
  after_hook "after_hook_plan" {
    commands     = ["plan"]
    execute      = ["sh", "-c", "mkdir -p ${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/plans/${path_relative_to_include()}; terraform show -json tfplan.binary > ${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/plans/${path_relative_to_include()}/plan.json"]
  }
}
```

Can be tried to generate a plan with simple terraform code(simple file creation in tf files) - and check if plan is generated, try to run with `--terragrunt-log-level debug` and `TF_LOG=debug` to see possible failures during plan creation

# Before & After hooks broken on main page

**lantern-sam** commented *Sep 7, 2023*

**Describe the bug**
On the main page: https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/

The link to `Before & After hooks` is 404'ing.

It goes to: https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/before-and-after-hooks/#before-and-after-hooks

But the page should be: https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/hooks (I think)

I assume it's this line here that needs changing:
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/docs/_pages/index/_key-features.html#L83C108-L83C108

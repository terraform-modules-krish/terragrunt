# Question: Would it be possible for terragrunt to have a feature to check dependency for new outputs that were specified in mock_outputs and if available, update a given json plan?

Use case:
We are looking for a way to update a json plan file with real outputs after the dependency has been ran. 

For example:
Say we have two new modules (Module A and Module B). Module B has a dependency on Module A. We run `terragrunt plan` on both of the projects, so Module B's plan has the mock_outputs in it (in order for terraform to succeed). 

We run `terragrunt apply` on Module A (it succeeds), but right before we run terragrunt apply on the second json plan file, it would be great if there was a utility/feature to check the outputs we are looking for in Module A (specified in mock_outputs of Module B) and if those are found, update the json plan file of Module B. Then we can apply it with the correct values.

One of our constants is we are unable to run another `terragrunt plan` on just Module B. 

Would this be feasible?

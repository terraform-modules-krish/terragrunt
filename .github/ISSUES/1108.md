# Create interactive Terragrunt tutorial

**brikis98** commented *Apr 1, 2020*

To make it easier to learn Terragrunt, it would be great if we had an interactive, step-by-step tutorial that walked you through the steps it takes to use Terragrunt: e.g., putting code in one repo, using it at a specific version from another, iterating locally using `--terragrunt-source`, making your backend config DRY, etc.

This could be either a tutorial built into the CLI itself, or some sort of web-based tutorial.

This sounds awesome!

If you're interested at all I've had a really good experience using Google's codelabs libraries for making tutorials like this. It's a static site generator from markdown -> html with the output being styled for tutorials like this: https://github.com/googlecodelabs/tools

I have no affiliation with that project, I just thought it might be a fit here if you don't want to build web-based from scratch

Hi ,

We already have terragrunt module for dev,qa, prod to install an application on AWS Ec2. I cloned the repository and I want to initialize the terragrunt to make sure its connecting with AWS or not. But Im getting below error while running 'terragrunt init' command on gitbash and powershell. 

Any suggestion and help is most welcome. Thanks !

Set up have - 
aws-cli/2.1.1 Python/3.7.7
terragrunt version v0.25.4
Terraform v0.13.4

Looks like an AWS auth error. Check out [A Comprehensive Guide to Authenticating to AWS on the Command Line](https://blog.gruntwork.io/a-comprehensive-guide-to-authenticating-to-aws-on-the-command-line-63656a686799) for instructions.

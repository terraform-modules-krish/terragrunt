# terragrunt with multiple required terraform versions

**fdavis** commented *Sep 14, 2018*

I have some old terraform AWS infrastructure that I'm working on updating to latest terraform.
Is it possible to support multiple required versions of terraform?

```
Error: The currently running version of Terraform doesn't meet the
version requirements explicitly specified by the configuration.
Please use the required version or update the configuration.
Note that version requirements are usually set for a reason, so
we recommend verifying with whoever set the version requirements
prior to making any manual changes.

  Module: root
  Required version: = 0.6.8
  Current version: 0.11.7

```

Thank you!

Terragrunt just executes the version of Terraform in your `PATH`. You can override that with the `--terragrunt-tfpath` argument or the `TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH` environment variable.

That sounds like somewhere in your Terraform code, you've defined the version limitations for Terraform.  You need to remove that constraint and then you should be fine.

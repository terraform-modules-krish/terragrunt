# Destroy module and its dependencies

**76creates** commented *Apr 17, 2023*

Hey team, Im having issues figuring out how to destroy module and its dependencies. My project is structured very similar to your [example repo](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example/tree/master/prod/us-east-1/prod), so I have env dir, and then modules, so "staging", and inside "vpc", "eks", and "k8s", how can I target "eks" in such way where terragrunt destroys "k8s" which is its dependency, but not "vpc"?

Hi,
if is required to exclude specific directories, can be used `--terragrunt-exclude-dir`:
```
 terragrunt run-all destroy --terragrunt-exclude-dir **/vpc
```

Hey @denis256, thanks for answering, so basically I cant do something like:
~~~
cd ./eks
terragrunt destroy
# it figures out that it needs to destroy `k8s` as well
~~~
or
~~~
terragrunt destroy --target=eks
# or, as an inverse case, even apply with --target
~~~
Nothing of implicit sort, only explicit `exclude`?
This can be hard to maintain when you have quite a bit modules, this feature doesn't look too hard to implement if its not already there.

[update]
Just ran `terragrunt destroy` and it prompted me that it has detected dependent modules, i must have missed something so far, idk how this happened. Anyhow, closing this one for now as I haven't fully explored this one obviously. Thanks!

# Terrugrunt plan falls when passed null to tostring() function

**serge-r** commented *Aug 18, 2023*

**Describe the bug**
Terragrunt plan falls with error when I tried to pass null argument to tostring() function. The error is not clear for understanding:

```
ERRO[0000] invalid character ',' looking for beginning of value 
ERRO[0000] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1 
```

**To Reproduce**
You can pass any variable which can be null to tostring() function. Or can pass null directly to tostring(). See the examples below. 

```hcl
// This will fall
locals {
  my_name = tostring(include.my_other_hcl.locals.possible_null_var)
}

```

```hcl
// This too
locals {
  my_name = tostring(null)
}

```

**Expected behavior**
Fix the error message or fix terragrunt behavior of processing terraform functions.

**Versions**
- Terragrunt version: 0.50.4
- Terraform version: v1.5.5
- Environment details (Ubuntu 20.04, Windows 10, etc.): I have got same behavior on MacOS X Ventura 13.3.1 (Intel)  and also on production env in atlantis container v0.25.0

**Additional context**
We have got this behavior after update terragrunt from v0.44.4 to 0.50.4. It has been difficult to find a reason of error, because error message and debug logs says no info what happened. Terraform [specification](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/tostring) says that tostring() function can accept null as an argument and return the null as a result. Right now we found the bypass using try() function with tostring() 

```hcl
my_name = tostring(try(include.eks.locals.lose_var,""))
```

But not sure that it covered all cases.

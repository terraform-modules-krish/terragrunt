# Terragrunt don't use AWS S3 KMS key

**number21** commented *Mar 20, 2023*

Hi! 

I try to switch Terragrunt backend S3 encryption from SSE-S3 to SSE-KMS with customer managed key.
I done few test on latest Terragrunt v0.44.5 and can't achieve success in that.
S3 bucket has set default S3-KMS encryption with CMK.
Even I manually re-encrypt state file to use KMS with CMK, Terragrunt keep saving a state file with default SSE-S3 encryption.

Maybe I do smth wrong. 
Who can help me with it?
<br />

Would you be able to share your configuration by any chance?

I tested kms CMK encryption with different values
Working `s3` backend examples

Example 1

`kms` alias

```hcl
remote_state {
  ## Local backend - useful for testing locally; writes state to stack directory
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    encrypt                 = true
    bucket                  = "terraform-state-${local.account_id}"
    region                  = "eu-west-1"
    key                     = "issues/${local.issue_id}-terraform.tfstate"
    kms_key_id              = "alias/paas-eks"
    disable_bucket_update   = true
    skip_bucket_root_access = true
  }
  generate = {
    path      = "_backend.tf"
    if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  }
}
```

Example 2

`kms` key id

```hcl
locals {
  issue_id   = "2492"
  account_id = get_aws_account_id()
}

remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    encrypt                 = true
    bucket                  = "terraform-state-${local.account_id}"
    region                  = "eu-west-1"
    key                     = "issues/${local.issue_id}-terraform.tfstate"
    kms_key_id              = "11644643-0000-0000-2222-7b9bf80539a3"
    disable_bucket_update   = true
    skip_bucket_root_access = true
  }
  generate = {
    path      = "_backend.tf"
    if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  }
}
```

Example 3

`kms` arn

```hcl
locals {
  issue_id   = "2492"
  account_id = get_aws_account_id()
}

remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    encrypt                 = true
    bucket                  = "terraform-state-${local.account_id}"
    region                  = "eu-west-1"
    key                     = "issues/${local.issue_id}-terraform.tfstate"
    kms_key_id              = "arn:aws:kms:eu-west-1:999999999999:key/11644643-eeee-dddd-aaaa-7b9bf8053333"
    disable_bucket_update   = true
    skip_bucket_root_access = true
  }
  generate = {
    path      = "_backend.tf"
    if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  }
}
```

Where key policy described in the docs

> Optional) Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a Key Management Service (KMS) Key to use for encrypting the state. Note that if this value is specified, Terraform will need kms:Encrypt, kms:Decrypt and kms:GenerateDataKey permissions on this KMS key.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "key-default-1",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Enable IAM User Permissions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::888888888:root"
            },
            "Action": "kms:*",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

All three examples results in CMK server side encryption.

@denis256 and @number21 this issue looks like a misconfiguration.

If state file was SSE-S3 encrypted, for CMK encryption to take effect, the state file should have changes, otherwise apply with not push CMK encrypted state file

Hi! Configuration is following 

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Grant access to KMS key to specific principals",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": [
                    "arn:aws:iam::*:role/*",
                    "arn:aws:iam::*:role/*"
                ]
            },
            "Action": "kms:*",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

Terragrunt
```
remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    encrypt        = true
    bucket         = local.env_var.terraform_state_s3_bucket
    key            = "${local.env_var.account_tags["Environment"]}/${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = local.env_var.terraform_state_aws_region
    dynamodb_table = local.env_var.terraform_state_dynamodb_table
    kms_key_id              = "arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:*:key/*"
    disable_bucket_update   = true
    skip_bucket_root_access = true
  }
}
```

Configuration for apply, was as mentioned above
The first screenshot shows the update time for terraform state file
The second shows encryption applied to the object on S3 bucket

terragrunt version v0.44.5
Terraform v0.13.5
+ provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws v3.76.1

I'm really confused about what I'm doing wrong

@number21 - I am facing the same issue. The bucket created by terragrunt is still using alias/s3 key, even after specifying a `kms_key_id`.

Did you manage to make it work?

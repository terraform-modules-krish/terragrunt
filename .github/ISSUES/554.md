# Install on Windows using chocolatey

**thedrow** commented *Aug 29, 2018*

Chocolatey is a package manager for powershell.
terragrunt is unfortunately not available there yet.

If anyone feels their up for the task, the [documentation ](https://chocolatey.org/docs/create-packages) explains how to create new packages and upload them pretty well.

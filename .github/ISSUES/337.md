# Permission error when trying to copy read-only file

**kevinburkeotto** commented *Oct 31, 2017*

downloadTerraformSource works by downloading Terraform, then copying files from the terragrunt options working directory to the terraform source directory.

I have files (TLS certificates) in that directory that have permissions set to 444. Eventually we try to overwrite those files (with the exact same contents) by calling `util.CopyFile`:

```go
// Copy a file from source to destination
func CopyFile(source string, destination string) error {
	contents, err := ioutil.ReadFile(source)
	if err != nil {
		debug.PrintStack()
		fmt.Printf("source: %s, dest: %s, copy err: %#v\n", source, destination, err)
		return errors.WithStackTrace(err)
	}

	return WriteFileWithSamePermissions(source, destination, contents)
}
```

This calls `ioutil.WriteFile`:

```go
func WriteFileWithSamePermissions(source string, destination string, contents []byte) error {
	fileInfo, err := os.Stat(source)
	if err != nil {
		return errors.WithStackTrace(err)
	}

	return ioutil.WriteFile(destination, contents, fileInfo.Mode())
}
```

Which fails with an error, because the first thing it attempts to do is open the destination file for writing:

```go
// WriteFile writes data to a file named by filename.
  // If the file does not exist, WriteFile creates it with permissions perm;
  // otherwise WriteFile truncates it before writing.
  func WriteFile(filename string, data []byte, perm os.FileMode) error {
  	f, err := os.OpenFile(filename, os.O_WRONLY|os.O_CREATE|os.O_TRUNC, perm)
  	if err != nil {
  		return err
  	}
  	n, err := f.Write(data)
  	if err == nil && n < len(data) {
  		err = io.ErrShortWrite
  	}
  	if err1 := f.Close(); err == nil {
  		err = err1
  	}
  	return err
  }
```

This is blocking deployment.

One workaround would be to check if a) there is a file at dest and b) if the file at dest is not writeable, remove it.

Another workaround would be to entirely remove dest every time, it seems like it will not be that costly if we're going to rewrite every file in dest every single time anyway.

Ah, good catch.

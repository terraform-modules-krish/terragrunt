# Feature Request: CLI flag to batch *-all actions

**jleeh** commented *Feb 21, 2020*

With a large mono-repo, I often need to run `plan-all` and `apply-all` with 20+ Terragrunt resources at once. Typically, these modules include around 3-4 providers, and when you run them all at once, it can kill the best of spec'd machines.

My proposal is a new CLI flag, for example `terragrunt-batch-count` which can be set to an arbitrary number dictating how many resources are applied/planned at once.

Eg: `--terragrunt-batch-count=3` would mean there's a concurrency of 3 for `plan-all` and `apply-all`.

There is a WIP to add this in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/636, but we have a few unresolved issues.

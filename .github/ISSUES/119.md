# Does spin-up include module outputs?

**lsc** commented *Feb 3, 2017*

I have modules that depend on outputs from other modules. 
As an example, I have a  module for provisioning etcd nodes that will need the subnet ids from my vpc module. 

Can I do something like  `subnets = ${module.vpc.subnet_ids}` in my `etcd` module instantiation?

I didn't think this one through, I should ofcourse use the remote state from the vpc.

# `jsonencode` Added to dependency outputs

**Chancebair** commented *Feb 23, 2022*

Hello!  Hopefully this is a relatively simple issue, I'm having an issue referencing a dependency block's output in an MSK cluster's inputs, it seems that the output is being produced with a `jsonencode` function that causes issues for the resource to be created

## Code
_modules/vpc/main.tf_
```
module "vpc" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"

  name = join("-", [var.application_name, "vpc"])
  cidr = var.vpc_cidr
  enable_ipv6 = true

  enable_nat_gateway = false
  single_nat_gateway = true

  azs             = ["${var.region}a", "${var.region}b", "${var.region}c"]
  private_subnets = ["10.17.128.0/19", "10.17.160.0/19", "10.17.192.0/19"]
  public_subnets  = ["10.17.0.0/19", "10.17.32.0/19", "10.17.64.0/19"]

  tags = {
    Name        = join("-", [var.application_name, "vpc"])
    Application = var.application_name
    Environment = var.environment
    Owner       = var.owner
    Maintainer  = "terraform"
  }
}
```
_modules/vpc/output.tf_
```
...
output "vpc_prv_subnets" {
  value = module.vpc.private_subnets
}
...
```
_modules/msk/variables.tf_
```
...
variable "vpc_prv_subnets" {}
...
```
_platform/msk/terragrunt.hcl_
```
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

terraform {
  source = "../..//modules/msk"
}

inputs = {
  cluster_name     = "sandbox-cluster"
  broker_nodes     = 3
  environment      = "sandbox"
  application_name = "TK"
  owner            = "TK"
  log_group        = "kafka/sandbox-cluster"
  vpc_prv_subnets = dependency.vpc.outputs.vpc_prv_subnets
  vpc_cidr_block = dependency.vpc.outputs.vpc_cidr_block
  vpc_id = dependency.vpc.outputs.vpc_id
}

dependency "vpc" {
  config_path = "${get_terragrunt_dir()}/../vpc"
  mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands = ["validate", "plan"]
  mock_outputs = {
    vpc_prv_subnets = ["subnet-1", "subnet-2", "subnet-3"]
    vpc_cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
    vpc_id = "fake-vpc-id"
  }
}
```

I have run terragrunt to apply the VPC already successfully but when running apply on the msk dir I receive:

I notice that `jsonencode` is added to the client_subnets block, which when removed manually allows for the resource to be created successfully, how can I change my code to match that?

Hi,
from what I see value of `vpc_prv_subnets` is passed to `aws_msk_cluster.client_subnets`, can type of  `vpc_prv_subnets` be specified as `type = list(string)`?
I suspect that without type definition it is passed as a string

Adding `type = list(string)` to the client_subnets var fixed it thank you!

# S3 backend doesn't work for Minio

**stephenliberty** commented *Aug 21, 2020*

As title says, it doesn't seem that the S3 remote backend works for Minio. If I just use regular ol' terraform, it works just fine, but terragrunt seems to force itself to talk to the AWS services regardless of what I enable/disable/etc. Right now, my config is..

```hcl
remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  disable_init = false
  config = {
    access_key="<access key>"
    secret_key="<secret key>"
    endpoint = format("http://%s.<minio url>/", get_env("BOX_NAME"))
    key = replace(path_relative_to_include(), "/", "_")
    bucket = "terraform-state"
    region = "main"
    skip_requesting_account_id = true
    skip_credentials_validation = true
    skip_get_ec2_platforms = true
    skip_metadata_api_check = true
    skip_region_validation = true
    disable_aws_client_checksums = true
    skip_bucket_ssencryption = true
    skip_bucket_accesslogging = true
    skip_bucket_root_access = true
    force_path_style = true
  }
}
```

Output is (after terragrunt inits everything else):

```

```

Perhaps I'm just missing something? Terragrunt version 25.37.

The `remote_state` block is only officially supported to work with AWS or GCP at the moment, as it is used to drive [the auto state bucket creation](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/keep-your-remote-state-configuration-dry/#create-remote-state-and-locking-resources-automatically).

While you can use it to manage other backends and aws-like backends, it is not a very ergonomic interface when using the others as you need to shutoff the autogeneration features and there are subtle issues around rendering blocks.

For those backends, we recommend using [generate blocks](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/keep-your-terraform-code-dry/#dry-common-terraform-code-with-terragrunt-generate-blocks) to manage the remote state configuration instead.

# handling secrets provided by the variables.

**fieldawarepiotr** commented *Sep 20, 2018*

I am not sure if this is a feature request or a question.

Some of the variables to our modules are secrets that should not be commited to git.
Using TF_ env variables is to not an option (I need to access any secret for any module instance).
My working approach is to use gruntkms to encrypt the secret and it to the tfvars file.
Then, before running the terragrunt command I decrypt the file.

Could this somehow be integrated into the terragrunt? Or some similar way?

Can you expand on this a bit more?

I intend to run terragrunt on CI/CD.

We use the same module multiple times with different arguments (regions, names etc.)
Let's take a variable `var.master_password`.
The content of that variable will vary from one module instantiation to other.
When running on CI, I'd have to do a lot conditional logic to provide the right `TF_master_password` variable.

Oh, I gotcha. I wonder if you could do this with Terragrunt [hooks](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt#before-and-after-hooks)? That is, in a `before` hook, run the `.tfvars` file through `gruntkms`?

I didn't know that exists. Thanks, i'll try it.

My initial approach
```
  before_hook "before_hook_decrypt" {
      commands     = ["apply", "plan"]
      execute      = ["cat {LONG_ABSOLUTE_PATH/TOMODULE}/terraform.tfvars | gruntkms decrypt --aws-region=eu-west-1 >{LONG_ABSOLUTE_PATH/TOMODULE}//terraform.tfvars"]
      run_on_error = true
    }

  after_hook "after_hook_decrypt" {
      commands     = ["apply", "plan"]
      execute      = ["git checkout {LONG_ABSOLUTE_PATH/TOMODULE}//terraform.tfvars"]
      run_on_error = true
    }
```

I saw in documentation, that there are some magic functions that could help me with pointing to `terraform.tfvars` in question. But I can't find anything helpful. Any hints with it?

This one: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt#get_tfvars_dir ?

This combination works:
```
before_hook "decrypt_secret_vars" {
      commands     = ["apply", "plan"]
      execute      = ["cat ${get_tfvars_dir()}/terraform.tfvars | gruntkms decrypt --aws-region=eu-west-1 > ${get_tfvars_dir()}/terraform.tfvars"]
      run_on_error = true
  }

  after_hook "checkout_tfvars_back" {
      commands     = ["apply", "plan"]
      execute      = ["git checkout ${get_tfvars_dir()}/terraform.tfvars"]
      run_on_error = true
  }

master_password = "kmscrypt::AQICAHhByZffSBtMjQxQ1X/V5CFpjkx3TYwugc539zAH/fcShAG4a0Lbv4UUYChjVuCBh+M9AAAAYTBfBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagUjBQAgEAMEsGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMprJ8NiwIfcTRFU4jAgEQgB6AWExrk89ywNEzkCs4CjeEOavjA0dr+V7A8X+RWlo="
```
The last problem is how to prevent from `git checkout` on stuff that shouldn't be changed. But this is out of the scope for this issue.

Thank you!

Instead of overwriting `terraform.tfvars` in the `before_hook`, you could generate `secret.auto.tfvars` into the same folder and then delete it in the `after_hook` (you use `.auto.tfvars` so [it gets picked up automatically](https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/variables.html#from-a-file)). Your `.gitignore` could include `secret.auto.tfvars`.

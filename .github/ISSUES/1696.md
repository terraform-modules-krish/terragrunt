# Encountered the following errors: EOF

**scooberu** commented *Jun 2, 2021*

Hi there! I'm a long-time Terraform user but I'm new to Terragrunt. I'm working on running `init`, `validate`, `fmt`, and `plan` in Gitlab CI. I'm running this out of an `alpine/terragrunt:latest` docker image, with following versions:

```
$ terraform --version
Terraform v0.15.4
on linux_amd64

$ terragrunt --version
terragrunt version v0.29.7
```

...and I'm running into the following errors when I try to `run-all init`:

```
$ terragrunt run-all init

I would argue that this error is very unclear and should probably offer more verbose suggestions; as well, I'd love some help in the short term for understanding how to dig into this and troubleshoot more!

Agreed that log output is not very helpful! [Increasing the log level](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/debugging/) might help. Other than that, we'd have to see your code, folder structure, etc to better understand what's happening.

# Terragrunt does not allow new `-chdir` option

**zachwhaley** commented *Dec 15, 2020*

Terraform 0.14 introduced a new global variable `-chdir` to allow Terraform to change working directory before executing.

https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/index.html#switching-working-directory-with-chdir

Terragrunt does not seem to allow this option.

```shell
$ terragrunt -chdir=dir plan
Incorrect Usage. flag provided but not defined: -chdir
```

Pretty sure terragrunt requires the first argument to be the terraform command... Did you try `terragrunt plan -chdir=dir`?

Yes, this is an illegal Terrraform command since `-chdir` is a global option and must be put before the command.

```shell
$ terragrunt plan -chdir=dir
...
[terragrunt] 2020/12/15 12:29:46 Running command: terraform plan -out=tfplan -chdir=dir
Usage: terraform plan [options] [DIR]
...
[terragrunt] 2020/12/15 12:29:46 Hit multiple errors:
exit status 1
```

Ah yup terragrunt doesn't support global flags for terraform. This probably needs a little bit of investigation to see where/how terraform global flags should be managed.

This might be a pretty significant issue with `0.15` and on. The path being appended at the end is removed [Terraform Release Notes](https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/0-15.html#commands-accepting-a-configuration-directory-argument)

For flexibility, chdir is required now to set context for the working directory.
This might also have some implications on the path scoping for the functions in terragrunt.

I'd be interested more in the use case this addresses, instead of using the option `--terragrunt-working-dir`, which seems to basically do the same thing?

@lorengordon that's great to know about, so I'll look at using that. However, to be clear, the main concern I had is that the current syntax provided by terragrunt debug output shows to reproduce the run using `terraform  -var-file=foo directorypath`. This syntax is not supported in `0.15`. If terragrunt is not depending on this in the actual combination of arguments then this is just a debug message to update I suppose. I'll have to look at the source to know how that's being set. 

If it's part of the arguments passed to the terraform executable instead of changing directories directory, then it's a breaking change by Terraform. 

If it's just a logging message then it's just a new debug output for 0.15+ to provide chdir to reproduce a command instead.

I believe that would be an artifact of how you are running terragrunt. Instead of:

```
terragrunt plan directorypath
```

use:

```
terragrunt plan --terragrunt-working-dir directorypath
```

Related to: #1651 

I just ran upgrade and am on version `0.29.0` and it failed with:
`Too many command line arguments. Did you mean to use -chdir?`

@brikis98 wanted to add you as I tried the new release from PR #1651  and first thing I got was an error related to this same underlying change in chdir being used. This new subcommand syntax deprecates the ability to run `terraform plan {DIR}` as a path. I'm not using this syntax anyway, as I'm using the recommended `--terragrunt-working-dir`, but it still is failing with this. 

I tried looking for where the terraform argument construction was to see if I could identify where the syntax for directory is used, but I couldn't find it. Figured you might point me in the right direction and maybe if you are experiencing the same error since you started that PR.

@sheldonhull Could you share your Terragrunt, config, what commands you're running, and the full log output so I can better understand the error you're seeing?

@zachwhaley 
As mentioned before terragrunt has [terragrunt-working-dir](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli-options/#terragrunt-working-dir) option that does the same thing as `-chdir` in terraform.
I think we can close this issue :)

One thing that argues for supporting ``-chdir`` -- Terragrunt offers to be a thin Terraform wrapper, but doesn't support this commonly used flag and instead has its own, competing flag. There are some CI integrations with Terraform that use ``-chdir`` where we can't just drop Terragrunt in because of this issue.

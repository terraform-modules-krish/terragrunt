# Mixing `--terragrunt-modules-that-include` and `--terragrunt-include-dir` flags

**Tailzip** commented *Dec 17, 2021*

Hi,

Is there a way to use `--terragrunt-modules-that-include` and `--terragrunt-include-dir` flags at the same time?

From what we understand, this is the intended behavior. Terragrunt will only filter _modules that include_ after it processes included dirs passed with `--terragrunt-include-dir` flag, and if _modules that include_ are not _included_ then it won't run the command for them.

Can we imagine having a dedicated command (or flag) that will make Terragrunt return the list of _modules that include_ paths, so it can be used with `--terragrunt-include-dir` flags only? Maybe a `--dry-run` flag?

Thanks

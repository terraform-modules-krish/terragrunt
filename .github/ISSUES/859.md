# Allow replication of state s3 buckets

**dmattia** commented *Sep 10, 2019*

Cross-Region Replication is necessary for my team to achieve SOC2 compliance.

This entails adding a block such as:

```terraform
replication_configuration {
    role = module.tf_state_replica.role_arn

    rules {
      id     = "FullReplica"
      prefix = ""
      status = "Enabled"

      destination {
        bucket        = module.tf_state_replica.bucket_arn
        storage_class = "STANDARD_IA"
      }
    }
  }
```

to the s3 bucket and having another bucket created in a different region.

As a current work around, I am creating the replica bucket in a module, having all other modules depend on that module, and then manually going into the aws console to update the replication settings of my state buckets

Are you asking if the S3 bucket created by Auto Init in Terragrunt can configure replication for the bucket too? If so, that strikes me as a bit too advanced for Terragrunt's Auto Init. At that point, you're better off creating the S3 bucket in Terraform, initially with a local backend, and once the bucket works the way you want, switch that Terraform module and all your other modules to use the S3 bucket as a backend.

That is what I was asking. Would this be something you would even be open to a PR for, or would you rather it not be in the project at all?

As I said:

I think this would be better handled outside of Terragrunt.

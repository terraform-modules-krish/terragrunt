# Output is written twice and incorrectly to StdErr

**thisispaulsmith** commented *May 10, 2023*

Terragrunt output is being rendered twice, once normally and then to StdErr

Example:

```


running

```
terragrunt run-all plan
``` 

should reproduce the issue. It appears to be linked to `run-all` However, this will also result in incorrect output written to StdErr

```
terragrunt plan --terragrunt-log-level debug
```


**Expected behavior**
This should not write to StdErr when there are no errors. Running in Azure DevOps results in the build failing.



**Versions**
- Terragrunt version: v0.45.10
- Terraform version: 1.4.6

Potentially related....

Adding a hook to run tfsec.

```
terraform {
  before_hook "before_hook" {
    commands     = ["apply", "plan"]
    execute      = ["tfsec", "--soft-fail" ]
  }
}
```

If there are issues reported, even though tfsec is configured to fail silently terragrunt fails with StdErr. Given tfsec doesn't fail I would expect terragrunt to succeed. If `--soft-fail` is remove terragrunt doesn't not proceed past the hook which you'd expect.

@thisispaulsmith, in addition to the log, any shell command returns an exit code, and If the exit code is anything other than 0 this indicates failure. `before_hook` supports `run_on_error` argument, see [docs](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#a-note-about-using-modules-from-the-registry). 


```
terraform {
  before_hook "before_hook" {
    ... omitted
    run_on_error = true
  }
}
```

**thisispaulsmith** commented *May 19, 2023*

@levkoburburas  This is happening regardless of exit code. Example running tfsec with with no error.

@levkoburburas I should add this this only happens when running in a linux agent. Running in windows locally is fine. No StdErr.

**levkohimins** commented *May 30, 2023*

Hi @thisispaulsmith

I did a little research and found that `terraform` behaves the same way, it prints standard output to _stdout_, and all logs to _stderr_. Since `terragrunt` is a `terraform` add-on, both tools should output log in the same way. Thus we cannot to do anything about your request. 

But I can recommend two solutions: 
* Change the log level to _fatal_ or _error_ `--terragrunt-log-level error`
* Redirect _stderr_ to _/dev/null_  `.... 2> /dev/null`

**thisispaulsmith** commented *May 30, 2023*

@levkohimins Do you mean tfsec? terraform works fine. It's only when adding the hook to tfsec that this fails above
***

**levkohimins** commented *May 30, 2023*

@thisispaulsmith Oh now I understand what you meant, thanks for the explanation. This is a bug, we'll fix it.
***

**levkohimins** commented *Jun 1, 2023*

Issue resolved in [v0.46.0](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.46.0) release

**celsocoutinho-tangany** commented *Jun 13, 2023*

I just bumped into this issue running on a Ubuntu 22 Azure DevOps agent. The command I'm using is 

`terragrunt run-all plan --terragrunt-no-auto-init`

Any recommendations?

***

**thisispaulsmith** commented *Jun 13, 2023*

@celsocoutinho-tangany 

Either don't use run-all (it works fine in that case) or wrap the return code with an error and don't fail on StdErr
***

**celsocoutinho-tangany** commented *Jun 13, 2023*

I am running a few terraform projects which are related, and I decided to use terragrunt to manage the dependencies on top of these projects. If I use `terragrunt plan` instead of `terragrunt run-all plan`, it is my understanding that I will have to run the command for each of the terraform projects, which will beat the purpose of using terragrunt in the first place, I guess! 

If I wrap the return code with an error, and prevent it to fail to stderr, I guess I will never be able to distinguish between a successful terragrunt execution (which is actually the case right now), and a failed one. 

If my assumptions are right, I hope there is a plan C 😄 
***

**thisispaulsmith** commented *Jun 13, 2023*

You can check the return code on the terragrunt command.

Using run-all isn't ideal as you'll get a mass of output that's hard to distinguish. You could create a template pipeline and loop over your individual components. 
***

**celsocoutinho-tangany** commented *Jun 14, 2023*

I solved it like this for now:

```
- task: Bash@3
  displayName: 'Running terragrunt'
  name: RunContainerTF
  inputs:
    targetType: inline
    failOnStderr: false  # Set to false to prevent terragrunt to fail on stderr
    script: |
      set -e  # Enable error checking
      terragrunt run-all plan
```
      
This way the task does not fail when terragrunt writes to `stderr`, but it does fail when there's an error while running terragrunt. But it is not working 100% of the times unfortunately, not really sure why
***

**levkohimins** commented *Aug 3, 2023*

@celsocoutinho-tangany, there is a pretty simple solution, downgrade the logging level `--terragrunt-log-level error`. In this case, only messages with the **error** level will be output to `stderr`.
***

**celsocoutinho-tangany** commented *Aug 4, 2023*

Hi @levkohimins , thanks for your reply! I had known that solution before, but it unfortunately reduces the amount of information that is output from terragrunt, which we rely during our CI/CD processes. 

In the meantime, the solution I have presented has been working fine, so I believe it is a more comprehensive solution for our use case

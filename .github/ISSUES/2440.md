# tflint-ruleset-azurerm: Failed to initialize plugins

**samba2** commented *Feb 4, 2023*

When running the tflint hook with terragrunt, I receive the following error:

````
Failed to initialize plugins; Unrecognized remote plugin message: Incorrect Usage. flag provided but not defined: -act-as-bundled-plugin
This usually means
  the plugin was not compiled for this architecture,
  the plugin is missing dynamic-link libraries necessary to run,
  the plugin is not executable by this process due to file permissions, or
  the plugin failed to negotiate the initial go-plugin protocol handshake

Additional notes about plugin:

        * Error while running tflint with args: [tflint --init --config /home/***/azure/.tflint.hcl /home/***/.terragrunt-cache/GUnzcwgY_Z12Iod7V0cXm90Mr3Q/V9u4X1WhUCaqO6kHtHpod5iHxOc/rg]
````
I am aware of [the troubleshooting notice in the docs](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/hooks/#troubleshooting), but I believe I've set things up correctly.

Here is my `.tflint.hcl`:
````
plugin "azurerm" {
  enabled = true
  version = "0.20.0"
  source  = "github.com/terraform-linters/tflint-ruleset-azurerm"
}
````

When I run `tflint --init --config /home/***/azure/.tflint.hcl /home/***/.terragrunt cache/GUnzcwgY_Z12Iod7V0cXm90Mr3Q/V9u4X1WhUCaqO6kHtHpod5iHxOc/rg` directly, things work.

Versions:
- terragrunt version v0.43.2
- TFLint version 0.44.1

Hi,
tried to define the `terraform` plugin in `.tflint.hcl`?
```
plugin "terraform" {
  enabled = true
  preset  = "recommended"

  version = "0.1.0"
  source  = "github.com/terraform-linters/tflint-ruleset-terraform"
}
```

@denis256 Good that you mention that. Yes, I also tried this and it worked. So the issue seems to be related with terragrunt + tflint + the azure rules plugin.

I had some time looking into that issue. I admit that I was confused by which plugins are actually needed although it was always mentioned, but as a terragrunt/ tflint beginner I did not bring together the puzzle pieces.

This made terragrunt v0.45.0 working with the [tflint hook](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/hooks/#tflint-hook):

````hcl
# explicit "terraform" plugin with version + source
plugin "terraform" {
    enabled = true
    version = "0.2.2"
    source  = "github.com/terraform-linters/tflint-ruleset-terraform"
}

# ...and the "azurerm" plugin
plugin "azurerm" {
    enabled = true
    version = "0.22.0"
    source  = "github.com/terraform-linters/tflint-ruleset-azurerm"
}

# rules follow here
...
````

Sorry for the confusion caused. I'll close the issue.

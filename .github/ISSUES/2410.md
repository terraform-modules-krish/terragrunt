# [Bug] tflint Has Module Inspection Enabled by Default

**theurichde** commented *Jan 12, 2023*

**Summary**

The Terragrunt `tflint` integration has module inspection enabled by default, set in [tflint.go:53](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/tflint/tflint.go#L53) via  "--module". 

I am not able to deactivate it, even with my config saying otherwise.

In tflint itself, this option is disabled by default (see [here](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint/blob/master/docs/user-guide/module-inspection.md#enabling)), meaning one has to set it explicitly in the configuration or via CLI.

**Expected Behavior**
Module inspection is disabled by default, enabling is an explicit task

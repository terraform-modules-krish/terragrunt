# Doing changes in Terragrunt code by using resources like aws_volume_attachment

**alexk2000** commented *Aug 21, 2020*

Hi.
Not the issue but can't understand if this case is possible in Terragrunt.
EC2 instance created by module [terraform-aws-ec2-instance](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-ec2-instance). In a while we need to add new ebs disk and attach by resource [aws_volume_attachment](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/volume_attachment), [example](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-ec2-instance/blob/master/examples/volume-attachment/main.tf).
Create separate module to attach volume to instance ?

This use case is best handled as a separate wrapper terraform module instead of using terragrunt directly. While this is certainly possible by defining two terragrunt.hcl configurations that are strung together with `dependency` blocks and `apply-all`, it is not very ergonomical compared to what you get with using `terraform` directly.

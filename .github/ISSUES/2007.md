# Terragrunt AWS SSO error

**yossarian04** commented *Feb 1, 2022*

When I try to run terragrunt against my named profile that is configured with AWS SSO, I receive the below error:

`ERRO[0005] 1 error occurred:
	* NoCredentialProviders: no valid providers in chain
caused by: EnvAccessKeyNotFound: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID or AWS_ACCESS_KEY not found in environment
SharedCredsLoad: failed to get profile
EC2RoleRequestError: no EC2 instance role found
caused by: RequestError: send request failed
caused by: Get "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/": dial tcp 169.254.169.254:80: connect: host is down
ERRO[0005] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1`

I'm setting the provider in my terragrunt.hcl file
`# Configure Terragrunt to automatically store tfstate files in an S3 bucket
remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    encrypt        = true
    bucket         = local.tf_rs_bucket
    key            = local.tf_rs_bucket_key
    region         = local.aws_region
    profile        = local.aws_profile
    dynamodb_table = local.tf_rs_table
  }
  //generate = {
  //  path      = "backend.tf"
  //  if_exists = "overwrite"
  //}
}`

I then add an OS environment variable with that named profile.  The cli works fine, but Terragrunt fails.  I'm using Terragrunt version v0.36.1 and Terraform version 0.14.11

It's like Terragrunt doesn't know where to look for the credentials.  Previous tickets around this issue say that this should work?

Hi,
can be shared output of execution with `--terragrunt-log-level debug`, maybe it will show more details about execution flow

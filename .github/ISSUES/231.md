# Terragrunt does not create local backend

**betabandido** commented *Jun 13, 2017*

We are using Terragrunt to create the infrastructure for an AWS service. Our setup scripts allow us to configure a remote S3 backend or just use a local one (for instance, to do a quick test that is not supposed to be shared with other developers).

While everything works fine when we use the S3 backend, Terragrunt seems not to be capable of initializing the local backend.

We are using Terraform 0.9.8 and Terragrunt 0.12.20.

`main.tf` contains the following configuration section for the backend:

```
terraform {
  backend "local" {}
}
```

And `terraform.tfvars` just contains:

```
terragrunt = {
}
```

When running

```
terragrunt init
terragrunt get
terragrunt plan
```

the following error is obtained:

```

Backend reinitialization required. Please run "terraform init".
Reason: Initial configuration of the requested backend "local"

The "backend" is the interface that Terraform uses to store state,
perform operations, etc. If this message is showing up, it means that the
Terraform configuration you're using is using a custom configuration for
the Terraform backend.

Changes to backend configurations require reinitialization. This allows
Terraform to setup the new configuration, copy existing state, etc. This is
only done during "terraform init". Please run that command now then try again.

If the change reason above is incorrect, please verify your configuration
hasn't changed and try again. At this point, no changes to your existing
configuration or state have been made.

Failed to load backend: Initialization required. Please see the error message above.

```

Is this a bug, or are we not configuring the local backend properly?

The error occurs when cloning a fresh copy of the repository (i.e., no `.terraform` directory is present).

Ah, I think the issue is that Terragrunt doesn't try to configure a backend unless you have a `remote_state` block defined. See if defining an empty block does the trick:

```hcl
terragrunt = {
  remote_state {
    backend = "local"
    config {}
  }
}
```
***

**betabandido** commented *Jun 13, 2017*

Oh, that was exactly the issue. I assumed `remote_state` shouldn't be used (as I wanted to use the local backend). But, after adding the empty block as you suggested, it is now working. Thanks!

It might be worth to add a note to the documentation mentioning the need to use the `remote_state` configuration item even for a local backend.
***

**brikis98** commented *Jun 13, 2017*

Yea, in Terraform 0.9, the naming convention changed from "remote state" to "backends". We have not updated our naming convention in Terragrunt yet. Readme PR is very welcome :)
***

**conorgil** commented *Jun 14, 2017*

Would be great to also change the keyword supported by Terragrunt from `remote_state` to `backend` for consistency with Terraform.

**alternico** commented *Aug 14, 2017*

Hi all,

I have the same issue. Even if I specify the following:

```
terragrunt = {
  remote_state {
    backend = "local"
    config {}
  }
}
```

No .tfstate file will be created.

I am running the following:
- terragrunt version v0.12.25 
- Terraform v0.9.11

Thanks

**jedierik20** commented *Sep 8, 2017*

Using latest v0.13.2 terragrunt and terraform v0.10.4  
terragrunt will not init/create the local backend in the specified path.

`    remote_state {
        backend = "local"
        config {
            path = "/somelocalpath/remote-state/na4-perfstage1"
        }
    }`

Pretty much no matter what I do I can't get the local file to exist.  I've looked for terraform issues around this - and didn't see any, however, I think it's a terraform problem, as I see the command `[terragrunt] 2017/09/08 18:01:55 Running command: terraform init -backend-config=path=mypath/blah`
***

**brikis98** commented *Sep 8, 2017*

@alternico and @jedierik20 In your Terraform code (the `.tf` files) you still need an empty block like this:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "local" {}
}
```

Without that, even if you specify the Terragrunt `remote_state` config, it won't do anything, as Terraform itself will ignore it.
***

**cyberious** commented *Oct 26, 2017*

I am running into the same problem, not wanting to use remote state as we are on OpenStack not AWS 
***

**jedierik20** commented *Oct 26, 2017*

As @brikis98 mentioned above --- did you add the empty block at the top of your TF files?  
terraform {
  backend "local" {}
}

I had to do this even when I was using the local state.
***

**cyberious** commented *Oct 26, 2017*

yes and the remote block in my terragrunt config section
***

**cyberious** commented *Oct 27, 2017*

when I have the remote backend in the `terraform.tfvars` either parent or include source it causes an error.
```
[terragrunt] 2017/10/27 12:46:06 runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference
```

I am using the pattern of folders with `terraform.tfvars` and including a parent folder with the common variables

_child_

```terragrunt  = {

  include {
    path = "${find_in_parent_folders()}"
  }
  
}
```

_parent_

```
terragrunt = {

  terraform {

    source = "${path_relative_from_include()}/../sources/generic"

    extra_arguments "common_vars" {
      commands           = [
        "apply",
        "plan",
        "import",
        "push",
        "refresh",
        "plan",
        "destroy"
      ]

      required_var_files = [
        "${get_tfvars_dir()}/../common.tfvars"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Please set the `TERRAGRUNT_DEBUG` to true so we can see the stack trace from your error.
***

**ColOfAbRiX** commented *Dec 12, 2017*

This is not working for me too, and the steps above are not really clear too. My understanding so far is that, to use a local backend, I have to:
 1) Define a `terraform { backend "local" {} }` block in my TF files
 2) Add a 
```
terragrunt = {
  remote_state {
    backend = "local"
    config {}
  }
}
```
block in a terraform.tfvars and... something else?
***

**brikis98** commented *Dec 12, 2017*

@ColOfAbRiX Looks mostly correct, except you should set a `path` in your terragrunt `config {}` block.
***

**ColOfAbRiX** commented *Dec 12, 2017*

Thanks @brikis98. Anyway I can't make it working. I'm migrating an existing infrastructure to terragrunt and at the moment, to learn, I'm using all local directories. I'm running terraform v0.11.1 and terragrunt v0.13.23 on CentOS 7.3. The directory structure is as you recommend:
```
.
├── modules
│   └── network
│       ├── inputs.tf
│       └── main.tf
└── live
    ├── test
    │   └── network
    │       └── terraform.tfvars
    └── terraform.tfvars
```
I then have the `terraform { backend "local" {} }` in `./modules/network/main.tf` and this code in the parent `./live/terraform.tfvars`:
```
terragrunt {
  remote_state {
    backend = "local"
    config { path = "/home/user/terraform.tfstate" }
  }
}
```
and this in the module `./live/test/network/terraform.tfvars`:
```
terragrunt {
  terraform {
    source = "../../../modules//network"
  }
  include {
    path = "${find_in_parent_folders()}"
  }
}
```
And this is what I get:
```

That error suggests your `terraform.tfstate` file has invalid JSON. What does it contain?
***

**ColOfAbRiX** commented *Dec 13, 2017*

Yes, the JSON file was valid. I also tried without a tfstate. But now I think I fixed it. I had to remove the `~/.terragrunt` directory and now it seems it works. I'll do more investigation to confirm.

**alternico** commented *Dec 22, 2017*

Hi,
for me, still does not work.
This is what I see in the logs:

**john-mcgowan-wowza** commented *Jan 12, 2018*

Something I'd like to clarify if someone has a moment.  I'm setting up a new project with terragrunt.  Initially I want to use local state files, but will eventually I will switch to remote state.  So I'm trying to  modularize the stuff required to make local state work so that I can "swap" it out when ready to do so.    

However, the problem that I'm coming across is that the only way to make it work is to have state related changes in both the "live" and the "modules/components" repo for the project.

Am I missing something.  Is there a way to get the 

```
terraform {
  backend "local" {}
}
```

part OUT of the module/component and into the live repo so that when a switch from local state to remote state is done it is all done in the "live" repo instead of having to make coordinating changes in multiple places?

Right now what I'm doing feels dirty and actually prohibits me from having a mix of remote and local state on a particular project (which I admittedly would probably never do)

FYI, I'm successfully using `extra_arguments` to generate the `-state` argument and put the state files into a separate directory of the "live" repo which makes for a nice "remote'ish" solution for when you want to experiment with something but still want to keep your .tfstate files apart from your .tf files.
***

**josdotso** commented *Feb 18, 2019*

This is blocking me from using terragrunt. My infrastructure modules shouldn't be hard-linked to a specific backend type. Some live infrastructure scenarios will need remote and some will need local. (e.g. We shouldn't be spinning S3 buckets for each person's local minikube cluster).

Looking for workarounds.
***

**jakauppila** commented *Mar 14, 2019*

Interested in this as well with the same use-case as @john-mcgowan-wowza 

As we do our initial development, I want to specify `backend "local" {}` but transition to `"s3"` in live; having to touch my module repositories to do that feels very wrong.
***

**jaimehrubiks** commented *Dec 16, 2019*

No solution? I should be able to change from local to s3 without changing code on my terraform modules
***

**barryib** commented *Apr 17, 2020*

FIW, Terragrunt now support [code generation](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#generate). So you can use it to generate your backend configuration.

So if you are using the swift backend (in openstack by example), you could generate the swift configuration.
***

**brikis98** commented *Jun 15, 2020*

As mentioned in the comment above, code generation is now supported, so closing this issue.

# question: determine apply/destroy order

**ibacalu** commented *Aug 7, 2020*

Hi!

This is more of a question. 
Is there a way to determine apply or destroy order the same way terragrunt would do it if you would run `apply-all` or `destroy-all` and save it maybe to an ordered json array or something else similar?

I tried using `terragrunt graph-dependencies` with `--terragrunt-include-dir` and converting that to a json array, but the order is not quite correct for dependencies in different sets of folders.
I am trying to use this order to generate dynamic pipelines and this way avoid running blindly `*-all` commands

this is somewhat related to #1271
I appreciate any help on this. Thank you.
<br />

I think I may have found a way albeit horrible.
Just 2 includes below, but I've tried it with more and it seems to be ok
Note: dependency blocks are defined in `Project/Storage/storage-dev/Policy` referencing the Service Account

```sh
# Apply order
terragrunt graph-dependencies --terragrunt-non-interactive --terragrunt-strict-include  --terragrunt-include-dir "Project/Storage/storage-dev/Policy"  --terragrunt-include-dir "Project/IAM/Service Accounts/dev-service-account" | dot -Txdot_json | jq '.objects | sort_by(._gvid) | .[] | select(.color!="red") | .name' | jq -s

# Destroy order
terragrunt graph-dependencies --terragrunt-non-interactive --terragrunt-strict-include  --terragrunt-include-dir "Project/Storage/storage-dev/Policy"  --terragrunt-include-dir "Project/IAM/Service Accounts/dev-service-account" | dot -Txdot_json | jq '.objects | sort_by(-._gvid) | .[] | select(.color!="red") | .name' | jq -s
```

We had discussed this in the past at gruntwork as something we should implement, but have not had the chance to do so. I updated the tags on the ticket to reflect the current state of things (This is a feature enhancement that needs design, and we are currently not actively working on it).

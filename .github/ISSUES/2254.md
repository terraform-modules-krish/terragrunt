# iam_assume_role_session_name and iam_assume_role_duration for aws authentication.

**srinathjamboju92** commented *Aug 24, 2022*

For iam_assume_role_duration,
Currently AWS provides upto 12h maximum duration where the generated session credentials are valid. But in terragrunt, this attribute seems to be accepting only till 1 hour. Is there a way you can allow to meet the maximum duration allowed by AWS?

For iam_assume_role_session_name,
We currently have a condition on the assume role policy that only a valid IAM user can assume the role, and we have multiple IAM Users who executes the terragrunt code. Is there a way that we can dynamically assign valid IAM user names to this attribute like from get caller identity?

Hi,
AFAIK, currently is supported only `iam_assume_role_duration` or CLI argument `--terragrunt-iam-assume-role-duration`

thank you @denis256 
Duration is not a huge problem.
But how about iam_assume_role_session_name ? Is there a solution to pass the usernames dynamically while init/plan/apply to the iam role? There is a condition in my case that only a valid iam user can assume the role(like below), and I do not want to hardcode the username` iam_assume_role_session_name` as there are many who contributes to the code.
        {
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "sts:RoleSessionName": "${aws:username}"
                }
            }

@denis256 or can anyone confirm if the above is actually possible with terragrunt?

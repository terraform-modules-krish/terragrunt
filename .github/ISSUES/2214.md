# Terragrunt fails with GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT env var set

**mgrzechocinski** commented *Jul 28, 2022*

Hi.

I'm trying to run my Terraform modules by Terragrunt, providing properly configured HCL file.

When I'm authorized as me (my Google Account), using ADC command `gcloud auth application-default login` - everything works as expected. However, for a couple of reasons I'd like to use a custom service-account by Terragrunt. My organization policy doesn't allow to create and download SA's private keys though and I don't want to download them even if it's allowed.

Usually I'm using impersonating SA with plain Terraform by setting:
```
export GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=<my_sa_email>
```

This is a perfect way of acting as a service-account by providing my own credentials in ADC for Terraform.
It works perfectly well with Terraform. However, when I run my Terragrunt code with this env set, I cannot access bucket with a remote state. 

```
│ Error: error loading state: Failed to open state file at gs://gcp-company-com-tf-state/company-1/dev-cb-112/tenant/default.tfstate: Get "https://storage.googleapis.com/gcp-company-com-tf-state/company-1/dev-cb-112/tenant/default.tfstate": impersonate: status code 403: {
│   "error": {
│     "code": 403,
│     "message": "The caller does not have permission",
│     "status": "PERMISSION_DENIED"
│   }
│ }
```

I'm sure that:
* the SA I'm referring to has the `Storage Admin` role on bucket with remote state
* I have a `Service Account Token Creator` role on this SA so I'm allowed to use it.

Anyone having such an issue?

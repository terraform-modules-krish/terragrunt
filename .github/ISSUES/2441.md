# Question regarding strange/verbose log message format

**apamildner** commented *Feb 9, 2023*


Hello! When I execute some terragrunt code, it always outputs its logs like this:
<img width="288" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10640074/217034684-be0e3ebd-c9f6-4758-9792-321d45a49373.png">



What is this `INFO[0000]`? Is it supposed to be like this or is my terminal misinterpreting the outputs from terragrunt logging?
Would prefer to only have `INFO` or something.

`Terragrunt version:  v0.40.2`

Hi,
since to print logs is used `logrus` library, it is the number of seconds from starting of application

# Terragrunt go panic with latest docker engine

**GenPage** commented *Mar 29, 2021*

I recently updated docker engine to 20.10.5 as prompted by Docker Desktop on Mac and terragrunt is throwing segmentation violations now inside of my container. Reverting the docker-engine version seems to help resolve the issue. The panic stack changes each run.

We install terragrunt in a docker container to use for our CI with the following (redacted unrelated bits):
```docker
FROM ubuntu:18.04
...
ENV TERRAGRUNT_VERSION=0.28.14
...
...
# Install terragrunt
RUN curl -Ls https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/download/v${TERRAGRUNT_VERSION}/terragrunt_linux_386 \
    -o /bin/terragrunt && chmod +x /bin/terragrunt
...
```

Terragrunt panic stack
```go

Sometimes it will throw:
```
fatal error: runtime路unlock: lock count
fatal error: runtime路lock: lock count

Terraform binary runs fine
```
root@9182555c8305:/opt/plangrid/app# terraform --version
Terraform v0.14.8

Your version of Terraform is out of date! The latest version
is 0.14.9. You can update by downloading from https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html
```

I know there isn't a lot pointing to the binary itself but I find it odd that the only change is docker-engine.

So uh, I just realized reading the dockerfile that some previous employee was installing the 386 binary instead of amd64. Changing to use the amd64 binary fixed the issue. Sorry for the false report.

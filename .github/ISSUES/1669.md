# AWS SSO Session and `iam_role` Parameter fails

**stevie-** commented *May 6, 2021*

Terragrunt version: 0.29.2
Terraform: 0.14.9
aws-cli: aws-cli/2.1.39 Python/3.9.4 Darwin/20.4.0 source/x86_64 prompt/off

We've found another issue with the AWS SSO session and terragrunt.

We've created a small test sample code, which triggers the issue on init already:

`terragrunt.hcl`

```hcl
terraform {
  source = "./"
}

iam_role = "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNTID:role/AN_IAM_ROLE_WE_ARE_ALLOWED_TO_ASSUME"
```

`main.tf`

```hcl
data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}
```

We set an ENV var `export AWS_PROFILE=sso_profile` and login via `aws sso login` succesfully. We check aws cli works.
Running terragrunt breaks:

```shell
❯ terragrunt --version
terragrunt version v0.29.2

❯ terragrunt init --terragrunt-log-level debug

Hm, not sure what the cause is, but if anyone has time to dig into this, a PR with a fix is very welcome!

Just guessing here, but there is a difference how the boto sessions is created.
If `NewSession()` is used, it may not consider aws profile config by default?

from [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/session/):
```
Sessions options from Shared Config

By default NewSession will only load credentials from the shared credentials file (~/.aws/credentials). If the AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG environment variable is set to a truthy value the Session will be created from the configuration values from the shared config (~/.aws/config) and shared credentials (~/.aws/credentials) files. Using the NewSessionWithOptions with SharedConfigState set to SharedConfigEnable will create the session as if the AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG environment variable was set. 
```

```go
# https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/daabff2426b6cd57b831156e854fbe1581da52fa/aws_helper/config.go#L128
sess, err := session.NewSession()
```
vs
```
# https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/daabff2426b6cd57b831156e854fbe1581da52fa/aws_helper/config.go#L67
sess, err := session.NewSessionWithOptions(sessionOptions)
```

A test  with ENV `AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG` set to  `true` was successful.

```bash
export AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG=true

rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

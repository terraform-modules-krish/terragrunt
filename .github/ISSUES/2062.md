# TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH regression: no longer overrides dependency's terraform_binary

**rhoboat** commented *Apr 7, 2022*

### Description of the bug
A customer has been struggling (patiently) with a possible regression in our handling of terraform binaries using `TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH`.

They reported that they found this change in our release notes:

> Updated behavior of terraform_binary. Now terragrunt will always prefer the setting in the configuration. This works around the issue where you need mixed terraform binaries in your project, and terragrunt doesnâ€™t know which one to use when fetching dependencies.

It seems very promising that this change might have introduced a regression.

This only seems to have an impact if you are using `dependency` in your `terragrunt.hcl`.

- TG module A - terragrunt.hcl calls out TG module B as dependency
- TG module B

They both set `terraform_binary`. When you invoke `terragrunt plan` on TG module A, the `TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH` overrides  but when the dependency B is evaluated, its `terraform_binary` setting is used, not `TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH`. The override is only at the top level!

### Expected behavior
Both TG module A and B should be affected by setting `TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH`, even though module B is a dependency in module A.

The customer reported that this was the case for them, until they upgraded Terragrunt from `v0.35.5` to `v0.36.6`. They suspect that it changed somewhere in between, probably at https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.35.15.

There are two issues embedded in this issue:
1. The customer used to be able to set `TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH=terraform`, but is reporting that this no longer works. Below, I've outlined my steps to investigate this, and in my results, I don't think it ever worked that way.
2. They also reported that there's an issue that _only_ happens when using `dependency`. They say that TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH will not override terraform_binary for a dependency. But I think they also mean that it used to work to set `TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH=terraform`. I'm a little confused, and not sure which of the two, or both, is at play here.

My recommendation: just look into the dependency issue, because this might be a regression.

### What I did for issue number 1 above
Some help with reproducing. Start with some terragrunt.hcl, and also would help to use something like `tfenv`, so that you can manage multiple versions of terraform under the hood, and mess with the override.

```hcl
# terragrunt.hcl
terraform_binary             = "/usr/local/Cellar/tfenv/2.2.2/versions/0.15.3/terraform"
terraform_version_constraint = "0.15.3"

terraform {
  source = "./modules/s3-static-website"
}

inputs = {
  website_domain_name = "foo.com"
}
```

Then have another `terragrunt.hcl` which similarly sets `terraform_binary` as above, and add it as a dependency within the above `terragrunt.hcl`.

After that, in the terminal, set the TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH to `terraform`
```bash
$ export TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH=terraform
$ echo $TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH
terraform
```

Check your version of terragrunt as well:
```bash
$ terragrunt --version
terragrunt version v0.35.5
```

Then check to see what version of terraform gets used by terragrunt:
```bash
$ terragrunt version
WARN[0000] No double-slash (//) found in source URL /Users/rhozen/Development/repos/terraform-aws-static-assets/modules/s3-static-website. Relative paths in downloaded Terraform code may not work.
Terraform v0.15.3
on darwin_amd64

Your version of Terraform is out of date! The latest version
is 1.1.7. You can update by downloading from https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html
```
The above output demonstrates that TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH=terraform didn't do anything.

But, as mentioned in our docs, if you set it to a real path:
```bash
$ export TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH=/usr/local/bin/terraform
$ echo $TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH
/usr/local/bin/terraform
$ terragrunt version
ERRO[0001] The currently installed version of Terraform (1.0.11) is not compatible with the version Terragrunt requires (0.15.3).
ERRO[0001] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1
```
It does attempt to override the installed version (1.0.11 in this case) with the one set in the config (0.15.3).

So this is how I tested that `TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH` was not meant to be set to just `terraform`. It has to be a path. I tested this same thing across versions from v0.35.5, up to v0.35.20, and then all the v0.36.x versions.

But the customer says this actually only used to work (setting to `=terraform`) when you used a dependency (??) ðŸ˜– 

I don't have the time to set up this example and test again, but would appreciate someone (@denis256?) looking into this! I also might have missed something.

Hi, will look into

Hi, 
I tested on setup:
```
app(terraform_binary=terraform_1.1.8, terraform_version_constraint = 1.1.8) -> dep1(terraform_binary=terraform_1.0.11, terraform_version_constraint = 1.0.11)
```
https://github.com/denis256/terragrunt-tests/tree/master/terragrunt-tfpath

`v0.35.4`, `v0.35.5` - execution fail during `run-all apply` on `app` module with error:  
```
The currently installed version of Terraform (1.1.8) is not compatible with the version Terragrunt requires (1.0.11) 
```

* `terraform_version_constraint` got inherited from `dep1`
* was executed terraform `1.1.8` defined in `app` module
* explicit setting of `TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH` didn't helped - same error 

[v0.35.5.txt](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/files/8462655/v0.35.5.txt)


`v0.36.6` - no errors during execution of `run-all apply`
* execution with `--terragrunt-log-level debug` shows that on each module was used own version of terraform, even if in `TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH=terraform` was specified other version - value from 
TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH was ignored 

[v0.36.6.txt](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/files/8462682/v0.36.6.txt)


Logic for this decision is:

https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/cli/cli_app.go#L537

So without any code changes, if is required to use a different version of terraform, in `TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH` should be specified something else than `terraform`:

```
$ TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH=/usr/bin/terraform_1.1.4 terragrunt run-all apply --terragrunt-log-level debug
...
DEBU[0001] Running command: /usr/bin/terraform_1.1.4 --version  prefix=[/home/denis/projects/gruntwork/terragrunt-tests/terragrunt-tfpath/dep1] 
DEBU[0001] Terraform version: 1.1.4                      prefix=[/home/denis/projects/gruntwork/terragrunt-tests/terragrunt-tfpath/dep1] 

...
        * The currently installed version of Terraform (1.1.4) is not compatible with the version Terragrunt requires (1.0.11).

```

**rhoboat** commented *Apr 11, 2022*

@denis256 Is this right?
1. So `TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH` must be an absolute path, and it didn't work on older versions to set it to `terraform`. We can say this definitively now. I also verified this from `v0.35.5` to `v0.35.20` and `v0.36.0` to `v0.36.6` (but only without any deps involved).
2. Next, your tests show that `app` and `dep` can specify separate versions, and be installed with those versions. 
3. Additionally, if you also set `TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH`, does it get applied to both `app` and `dep`? 
	- `v0.35.4` and `v0.35.5`: If using different `app` and `dep` version via `terraform_version_constraint` and `terraform_binary`, you got errors. 
		- Explicitly setting `TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH` only overrides `app`?
	- `v0.36.6`: If using different `app` and `dep` version, you don't get errors, things apply with separate versions. 
		- Explicitly setting `TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH` does not override anything? Still overrides app?

[Still editing the above...]

Is that now correct?

**denis256** commented *Apr 11, 2022*

Mostly yes, additional notes:

1. `TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH` - should have value different than `terraform` to take effect, can be absolut path, can be executable from `$PATH`

2. True, if `terraform_version_constraint` is not defined

3. a. `TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH` + `v0.35.4/v0.35.5`: terraform is overrided for `app` and `dep`, execution fails in `dep` 
  b. `TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH` + `v0.36.6` + disabled `terraform_version_constraint`: terraform is overrided for both `app` and `dep`  

Example for 3b:
```
TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH=terraform_1.1.4 terragrunt run-all apply --terragrunt-log-level debug 
...
DEBU[0001] Running command: terraform_1.1.4 apply -auto-approve -input=false  prefix=[/home/denis/projects/gruntwork/terragrunt-tests/terragrunt-tfpath/dep1] 
...
DEBU[0002] Running command: terraform_1.1.4 apply -auto-approve -input=false  prefix=[/home/denis/projects/gruntwork/terragrunt-tests/terragrunt-tfpath/app]

Here is the pattern we normally use (I am one of the customers impacted by this).

In Atlantis workflows we set `TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH`, leveraging the `atlantis_terraform_version` local from terragrunt.hcl.

```
locals {
  tfenv_vars                 = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("tfenv.hcl"))
  tfenv_install_dir          = local.tfenv_vars.locals.tfenv_install_dir
  terraform_version          = "1.1.7"
  atlantis_workflow          = "terragrunt"
  atlantis_terraform_version = local.terraform_version
}

terraform_binary             = "${local.tfenv_install_dir}/versions/${local.terraform_version}/terraform"
terraform_version_constraint = local.terraform_version

include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

dependency "this" {
  config_path = "../../us-east-2/debug"
}

terraform {
  source = "git::https://gitlab.com/rivian/dc/platform/terraform-modules/null.git//?ref=0.1.5"
}

inputs = {
  desired_count = dependency.this.outputs.resource_count
}
```

@gmaghera What if you remove your `terraform_version_constraint`? It looks like the `TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH` override will work for modules and dependencies, as per 3b from Denis's comment above.
***

**gmaghera** commented *Apr 12, 2022*

We could if it does not provide value.  There is some part of this override which was never really clear to me.

Let's say we have Terragrunt moduleA and moduleB. ModuleB is a dependency of moduleA.

ModuleA sets `terraform_version_constraint` and `terraform_binary` to Terraform version 1.1.7.
ModuleB sets `terraform_version_constraint` and `terraform_binary` to Terraform version 0.15.5

With 0.35.6 where the above code works for me, if I call `terragrunt` commands against moduleA, with `TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH` set to a path where I have a Terraform binary of version 1.1.7, I expect moduleA to use TG with TF version 1.1.7.  But I don't fully understand what happens when moduleB outputs are looked up. Is that also going to to use TG with TF version 1.1.7?

Setting the `terraform_version_constraint` together with `terraform_binary` was meant to assure that the Terraform version of each Terragrunt module is respected, even when invoked indirectly in a dependency chain. If that hasn't really been happening, despite the effort, then there's little value to it.

**denis256** commented *Apr 14, 2022*

Hi,
in the current implementation, value of `TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH`(if different than `terraform`) will override `terraform_binary` so for moduleB will be used TF 1.1.7

Example run:

**gmaghera** commented *Apr 14, 2022*

Thank you, @denis256 for the confirmation.

I am going to research some options which would remove the need for the TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH override with Atlantis. For local development, Terragrunt sets the Terraform binary per dependency, and I'd rather extend that approach to Atlantis too, instead of using the entry module's TF version for querying dependency outputs.

**rhoboat** commented *Apr 20, 2022*

@gmaghera Regarding this issue, there has been a behavior change. Based on the research we did into the current behavior, now `TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH` will override both the top call and the dependencies.

The desired behavior for your case, is for each module/dependency to use different terraform versions. However, that was a bug in our code and not the desired behavior. I'm sorry that you had built your solution upon this bug, but I understand the issue now.

The best option is to match up your Atlantis environment to your local environment. That means, either you should have `tfenv` installed on both, so that you don't need `TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH`, or you should avoid using `tfenv` in both environments. This is my recommendation as it sounds like you need `TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH` because your Atlantis machines don't have `tfenv` installed, so they can't use the directives in your `terragrunt.hcl`. Maybe you can have tfenv installed on those machines. 

You could also implement a hack, that chooses the right terraform version regardless of what environment you're in (Atlantis vs local development):
```hcl
/*
 * For example, create a map of module to terraform version:
 * TERRAGRUNT_TF_BINARY_PATH_MAP = {"dev/us-east-2/foo/rds": "terraform1.0", "dev/us-east-2/foo/vpc": "terraform0.15"}
 */
locals {
  lookup_map_str = get_env("TERRAGRUNT_TF_BINARY_PATH_MAP", "")
  lookup_map = {
    local.lookup_map_str != ""
    ? jsondecode(local.lookup_map_str)
    : null
  )
}

terraform_binary = (
  local.lookup_map == null
  ? "path/to/tfenv/terraform"
  : local.lookup_map[path_relative_to_include()]
)
***

**rhoboat** commented *Apr 20, 2022*

I will close this issue as not a bug and we will clarify this behavior in our docs.
***

**gmaghera** commented *Apr 22, 2022*

@rhoboat thank you for the outstanding support! I understand that we were exploiting a bug previously, and that was certainly not the intention. We're looking into setting the binary via tfenv in Atlantis as we do locally, as you suggested.

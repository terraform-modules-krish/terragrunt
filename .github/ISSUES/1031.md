# Add interpolation to read hcl file

**barryib** commented *Feb 4, 2020*

It would be nice if there was an interpolation to read hcl file. Maybe something like `get_hcl_file()`.This can be used instead of `yamldecode(file("FILE_PATH"))` within locals.

```hcl
locals {
  common_vars = get_hcl_file("FILE_PATH.hcl"),
  region = "us-east-1"
}
```

Please see [the RFC on imports](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1025). Will close this as we have plenty of tickets requesting similar functionality and there is already an RFC to design a solution. You can follow that PR to get updates on the progress.

# Intermittent test failure in TestPatchAwsProviderInTerraformCodeHappyPath/one_empty_aws_provider,_with_region,_version_override

The test occasionally fails with:

```
Failed

This is most likely  an ordering issue, where the `provider` attributes are in a `map`, and the order in which they are rendered can change.

# Terragrunt stuck during destory on windows

**prashantguleria** commented *Jun 21, 2023*

**Describe the bug**
I have multiple resources that are destoryed using script. In the end there is an azure ad application that needs to be destroyed. This is the only application which is not dependent on any of the resources, but few resources depends on it.

On running destory ` terragrunt run-all destroy`, The process is stuck in the end and not responding.

Even when I press Ctrl ^ C, errors are generated :

time=2023-06-21T11:44:35+05:30 level=error msg=Error forwarding signal: not supported by windows prefix=[D:\r\env_creation_scripts\terraform\1.azure_ad_application] 
time=2023-06-21T11:45:05+05:30 level=error msg=Error forwarding signal: not supported by windows prefix=[D:\env_creation_scripts\terraform\1.azure_ad_application]


**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior, code snippets and examples which can be used to reproduce the issue.

```hcl

#### In the module where the application is referred
dependency "create_access_manager_app"{
  config_path = "../1.azure_ad_application"
  skip_outputs = false
}
```

**Expected behavior**
The script should have gracefully thrown exception or complete successfully

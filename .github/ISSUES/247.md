# Changed aws region in terraform.tfvars, terragrunt plan would leave old vpc?

**kcrouch** commented *Jun 28, 2017*

I used Conor Gilsenan's sample_configurations at

https://github.com/conorgil/terragrunt/commit/d0024f977fb5bb34f8fce2c16ef6c32d80b6c678

Changed bucket, region, and lock_table in 01_one_account_one_region/live/terraform.tfvars

and then hopped over to 01_one_account_one_region/live/staging/vpc

to give it a test.

$ terragrunt plan

Plan: 7 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

$ terragrunt apply

Apply complete! Resources: 7 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

This deployed the VPC to us-east-1 since that was the default in the module.  Exactly what I expected.  I didn't really want to use us-east-1 though, so I added 

aws_region = "us-west-1"

to my 

01_one_account_one_region/live/staging/vpc/terraform.tfvars

and ran the plan again.

Plan: 7 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

I would have expected terragrunt/terraform to destroy the old resources in us-east-1.  I had to comment the aws_region variable out, do a destroy, uncomment it out, and do an apply to move the VPC.  Is this a bug?  An ambiguity?  A poor expectation on my part?  

Thanks all!

If it comes up as "add" every time, it sounds like perhaps your state isn't being saved? Can you post the log output and more details about your file structure, `.tfvars` contents, etc?

I configured the vpc for us-east-1

$ grep region terraform.tfvars 
aws_region = "us-east-1"

Ran the apply

$ terragrunt apply

Plan: 7 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
Releasing state lock. This may take a few moments...

It will create new stuff, but not destroy the old...

@kcrouch It looks like this has nothing to do with Terragrunt, but just the way Terraform works. For example, I just created the following `main.tf`:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_eip" "example" {}

output "ip" {
  value = "${aws_eip.example.public_ip}"
}
```

I ran `terraform apply`:

```
Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

ip = 34.227.85.26
```

Then `terraform plan`:

```
No changes. Infrastructure is up-to-date.
```

Then I changed the region to `eu-west-1`:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-1"
}
```

And ran `terraform plan` again:

```
+ aws_eip.example
    allocation_id:     "<computed>"
    association_id:    "<computed>"
    domain:            "<computed>"
    instance:          "<computed>"
    network_interface: "<computed>"
    private_ip:        "<computed>"
    public_ip:         "<computed>"
    vpc:               "<computed>"


Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
```

Note that there is 1 to add, but nothing to change or destroy. I'm using purely Terraform, so Terragrunt is not related.

My guess on why this happens based on how Terraform works:

* When you run `apply` the first time, it stores data about what was created in the state file. This data includes unique identifiers for each resources, such as the EIP ID.
* When you make changes and run `plan`, it fetches info for each of those resources using their identifiers, and compares the returned data against what's in your code.
* When you change regions, the requests for info about those resources probably *returns no data* because those identifiers don't exist in the new region. As a result, Terraform sees this as a 100% create, as if there is nothing to change.

It's definitely unintuitive and surprising behavior. Perhaps you could open a bug in the Terraform GitHub account to follow-up on this?

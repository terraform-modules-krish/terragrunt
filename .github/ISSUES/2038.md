# Dependancies between modules that can support data sources and not outputs for secrets

**flowinh2o** commented *Mar 14, 2022*

Hello everyone.  Is there a way to pass data from one module to another?  For example I have a rds database that I am creating in one rds/terragrunt.hcl and then I would like to use a 1password module running in another terragrunt.hcl file.  When running the rds stack it would be nice to be able to read the datasource in the 1password via the dependency block without referring to outputs as they should not stored in state.  Is this possible?

Hi,
I was thinking to save sensitive data to a file and later reading it through `file` function

```
dependency "generator" {
  config_path = "../generator"
  mock_outputs = {
    sensitive_file = "file.txt"
  }
}
inputs = {
  pass = file("../generator/${dependency.m1.outputs.sensitive_file}")
}
```

Thanks for the suggestion @denis256.  In order to do that we would just need to play with the formatting of what is being stored in 1pasword to see if this is something that would work and then just we would need to make sure these files are in .gitignore.  Wish we could just use data resource between modules.

Can we generate Terrafrom executable code from Teeragrant commands? or we need to write our own command form that ?

Can you provide an example of what you are looking for? Terragrunt does provide a way to monkey patch terraform modules (using `generate` blocks), but it doesn't work like a compiler (that is, there is no terragrunt command that only generates the terraform module without doing anything else).

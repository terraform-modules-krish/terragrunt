# Can not set variable to null in Terragrunt inputs

**yorinasub17** commented *Oct 3, 2019*

This needs investigation, but we were seeing some behavior where if you try to use `null` as one of the variable values in `inputs`, terragrunt translates it as the string `"null"` by the time it gets to terraform.

Did a quick test, @yorinasub17. If the variable is defined as a `number` then it will fail with a `Error: Invalid value for input variable` and explicitly with `The environment variable TF_VAR_vm_default_capacity does not contain a valid value for variable "vm_default_capacity": a number is required.` if you use `null` in the inputs.

If the variable is defined as a `string`, then it will parse `null` as a literal string instead: `resource_group_name = "bastion-development-rg" -> "null-development-rg"`

This may be a limitation of terraform. I think if you run `terraform apply -var foo=null`, it parses `null` as a string.

I just ran into this same issue where I have some conditional code around null string variable handling to create a resource.  Passing null from terragrunt.hcl negates the null handling, though when omitting the variable from inputs in terragrunt.hcl, null handling works as expected.

Hello all,
I'm facing same issue which is blocking my terraform modules executions when using Terragrunt:

```
inputs = {
  optional = try(dependency.foo.outputs.optional, null)
}
```
output: 
```
Error: Invalid value for input variable

The environment variable TF_VAR_optional does not contain a valid value for
variable "optional": a number is required.
```

I've just submitted a fix in the pull request [1367](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/1367) (with option for old behavior)

Same problem , trying to pass null to input for certain environments

> Same problem , trying to pass null to input for certain environments

You can use this approach to sort out the null approach avoiding to pass null values to the inputs (if you are using default values inputs in your modules, else it would fail)

```
inputs = {
  for key, val in {
    # ... your inputs ...
  } :
  key => val if val != null
}
```

Thanks @yorinasub17 for this tip!

Looks like I faced the same issue:
```HCL
include "envcommon" {
  path           = "${dirname(find_in_parent_folders())}/_envcommon/prod/rds/alpha/terragrunt.hcl"
  merge_strategy = "deep"
}

dependency "rds-alpha-master" {
  config_path = "${get_terragrunt_dir()}/../../../../eu-north-1/prod/rds/alpha"
}

inputs = {
  cross_region_replica = true
  replicate_source_db  = dependency.rds-alpha-master.outputs.db_instance_arn

  # Username and password should not be set for replicas
  username = null
  password = null

  multi_az = false
```

In rendered json I can see:
```
   + username                              = "null"
```
And then I get: 
```
 Cannot change master user password on an RDS postgres Read Replica because it uses physical replication and therefore cannot differ from its parent.
```

The problem has been relevant for three years, it seems they are not going to solve it, have there been any crutches or workarounds?
* In the comments I saw so far only sort out the null approach

Try generating a tfvars file that sets the variable to null?
***

**anitakrueger** commented *Jul 13, 2022*

I have just hit this problem with a few variables that my module has defaults for. But they all turn out to be set to the string "null" in the state. Is there no traction on this after 3 years? Or is there another workaround like a conditional to leave the variable out from the inputs?
***

**MaoChhaya** commented *Jul 15, 2022*

I noticed that it got `"null"` when a variable is only defined as `type = string , number or bool` and put its value in terragrunt `inputs = {}`.

I hope that it will be fixed asap so I don't need to make a validation or condition in very variable

**jonasthehobbit** commented *Nov 29, 2022*

Just had this issue too, what are people using as a workaround?

**DanielViglione** commented *Dec 2, 2022*

wow, got this issue today. A big limitation.

**mwarkentin** commented *Feb 1, 2023*

We're running into this problem as well.

Edit: Creating a `terraform.tfvars` file and setting the value to null there worked for me.

Randomly pinging a maintainers in hopes that this gets attention...  Sorry...  This issue is problematic.

This is indeed rather ugly and limiting. I would like to not have to have a specific check for "null" strings.

**sherifabdlnaby** commented *Mar 20, 2023*

Faced this today, big limitation in Terragrunt IMO.

**rinerb** commented *Mar 27, 2023*

I ran into this today.

This is implicit type coercion, and it would help to produce at least a warning message until passing nulls to inputs is supported.

**ellisonc** commented *Apr 4, 2023*

Hello everyone, quick update on this issue.  This is indeed a limitation of terraform. The variable loader for environment variables and `-var` command line options intentionally does not evaluate expressions like the tfvars file loader does. We had previously prototyped a solution that uses tfvars files, but that opens up security risks that are unacceptable for some of our customers. I'll be keeping an eye on the relevant [terraform issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29078) and will do what I can to get a solution pushed through.

Until then, there are a few workarounds mentioned in this issue. Alternately, if you have control of the module you are trying to use the terraform team suggested the following workaround: 

Set the type constraint for the variable to type = any, which tells Terraform to expect a value of any type, and then use a custom validation rule to restore the constraint that it must be something stringable:
```
variable "memory" {
  type = any

  validation {
    condition     = can(tostring(var.memory))
    error_message = "The \"memory\" value must be a string."
  }
}
```
You'd then be able to set the environment variable either to a literal string expression or to null:

```
TF_VAR_memory='"foo"' # single quotes to escape the literal double quotes
TF_VAR_memory='null'
```

Terragrunt directly translates your inputs into TF_VAR_ statements.  The examples above would translate to:

```
inputs = {
  memory = "\"foo\""
}
inputs = {
  memory = null
}
```

Hello @denis256, thank you for the update. Just fetched the latest version of Terragrunt for our project and saw that terragrunt init now always generates an empty .terragrunt-null-vars.auto.tfvars.json file in the repository even though we are only using hcl configs for our projects without empty inputs. Is there an option to deactivate the generation of the file with the help of a cli-flag or configuration similar to the skip_region_validation when generating the provider block?
***

**denis256** commented *Aug 16, 2023*

Hello,
which issues cause having empty `.terragrunt-null-vars.auto.tfvars.json` ?
***

**grimm26** commented *Aug 16, 2023*

> Hello, which issues cause having empty `.terragrunt-null-vars.auto.tfvars.json` ?

that's the question, right? I started having that file show up with just `{}` in it, too. I don't know why. I'm going to just add it to `.gitignore`
***

**dmatkovic** commented *Aug 17, 2023*

Hello @denis256, no immediate issue for the execution of the code but it would be nice if the generation could be skipped as described in #2670 so that not every terragrunt project in the future has to generate or ignore this file in the repository when there is no need for it in case of being empty.

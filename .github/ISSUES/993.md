# for_each block within terragrunt.hcl

**dudicoco** commented *Jan 9, 2020*

Hi,
I would like to use a dynamic for_each block within the child terragrunt.hcl file:
```
terraform {
  dynamic "before_hook" {
    for_each = local.file.releases
    content {
      commands     = ["apply", "plan"]
      execute      = ["helm", "diff", "upgrade", "--allow-unreleased", before_hook.value.name, before_hook.value.chart, "--version", before_hook.value.version]
    }
  }
}
```

This causes the following error:
```
Unsupported block type; Blocks of type "dynamic" are not expected here.
```

I'm would like to use this as a workaround to the fact that the Terraform helm provider does not provide a helm-diff output in the terraform plan.

Is there a way to use for_each blocks in a similar way to the example above?
Is it possible to run a command during/before the terraform plan natively within the terraform code?

Thanks!

Adding support for this would be reasonable, as long as the implementation is not too complex. I do worry about terragrunt's config exploding to a full fledged language though as we want to keep terragrunt as thin as possible.

E.g can you instead use a python or bash script to run each of the diffs in the hook, taking in the `local.file.releases` as json using `jsonencode`?

Anyone wanting to implement this should write an [RFC](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/community/contributing/#file-a-github-issue-or-write-an-rfc) given the potential complexities.

Thanks @yorinasub17.
Yes, using a python/bash script is the alternative I've considered as well, however, I would prefer to use a native function within terraform/terragrunt to keep the code as clean and understandable as possible with less chance of things breaking down.

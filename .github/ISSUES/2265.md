# Define syntax of terraform_version_constraint and terragrunt_version_constraint

**stevenpitts** commented *Sep 2, 2022*

The docs for [terraform_version_constraint](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#terraform_version_constraint) and [terragrunt_version_constraint](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#terragrunt_version_constraint) do not specify syntax rules.

The examples show `terraform_version_constraint = ">= 0.11"` and `terragrunt_version_constraint = ">= 0.23"`, which gives a partial answer.

My use case was wanting to pin a major and minor version, and it's unclear what syntax I would use to do that.

I've tried `terraform_version_constraint = "latest:^0.11"` and `terraform_version_constraint = "~= 0.11"`, both of which give `Malformed constraint` errors.

Update: Turns out the syntax I wanted was `terraform_version_constraint = "~> 0.11.0"`. It's actually defined here: https://www.terraform.io/language/expressions/version-constraints#version-constraint-syntax

Could this be linked in the docs?

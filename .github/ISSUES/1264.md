# Piping output to variable

**devops-ameyer** commented *Jul 24, 2020*

Hello,

I'm trying to run a "Terragrunt plan -out=$PLAN" but it seems I'm unable to use a variable with my plan. I'm trying to use gitlab ci to output the plan into gitlab merge requests but I'm unable to output the plan into a variable or create a plan file. 

This may be a specific problem with my gitlab ci but I wanted to run it by you guys as well.

What is the full command you're running? And the full log output?

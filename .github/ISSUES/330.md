# pass a file as an argument to a terraform module

**ebarault** commented *Oct 27, 2017*

hi,

I wan't to keep my project DRY but have a module that requires a config file as an argument (used with terraform's `${file(..)}` used in a `template_file` datasource)

`.tfvars` files do not support multiline variables as per terraform documentation.
Furthermore it's often preferable to pass a full file as an argument rather than putting it inlined with `EOF` directive in a `.tf` file.

Currently the aforementioned file is contained inside the terraform's module itself, what would be my best option to move it back inside my terragrunt's `live` directory ? 

thx,

<br />

Could you update your module to take in a `file_path` param and to call `file(var.file_path)` on it? If so, you could set `file_path` in your `.tfvars` file to a path in `live`.

hi @brikis98,

Yes i have full control on the module, and passing the file path is an option i have considered.

But is there a way to use a `file_path` in the `.tfvars` that allows keeping a clear separation of concerns between modules' code and environment variables?

As far as i remember with terragrunt the module's code is downloaded and executed in a tmp directory so having access to the `live` dir would mean using an absolute path?
(let me check with a relative path inside the live dir)

It would also be best to avoid referring to the env itself in the `file_path` var : `dev/service/config.yml` would not be a good separation of concerns compared to `service/config.xml`

Use a relative path with one of the [Terragrunt helpers](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt#interpolation-syntax) to create an absolute path. Example:

```hcl
terragrunt = {
  terraform {
    source = "..."

    extra_arguments "path" {
      commands = "${get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars()}"
      arguments = ["--var", "TF_VAR_file_path=${get_tfvars_dir()}/../service/config.xml"]
    }
  }
}
```

okkkk, i see, the solution is to pass the file path within a terragrunt block and not inside a plain `.tfvars` file. 

Too bad it hides the declaration of this variable inside the terragrunt specific directive : 
i built my project to break the terragrunt config into a `terraform.tfvars` that has the `terragrunt = {...}` block only and a `component.tfvars` that has the vars definition. So now I have most of the config vars inside the `component.tfvars` and the config file path inside the `terraform.tfvars` file.

Anyhow I don't see any other way around. 

maybe a quick addition to the doc illustrating the use case would be worth it !

Thanks for your help üëç

General-purpose interpolation in `.tfvars` files is an [open issue](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/132), so for now, this is the best workaround. PRs to docs welcome :)

for whomever would find this, the exact syntax would be:
```
    extra_arguments "path" {
      commands = ["${get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars()}"]
      arguments = ["-var", "file_path=${get_tfvars_dir()}/../service/config.xml"]
    }
```

i fixed a typo above: we don't need to pass a prefixed TF_VAR_xxx var as we're directly using Terraform's `-var` option. (see [this doc](https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/variables.html#command-line-flags))

Ah, of course, good catch :)

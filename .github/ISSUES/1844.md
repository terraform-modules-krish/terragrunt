# get_parent_terragrunt_dir function action has appeared to change without warning

**Daemonslayer2048** commented *Oct 4, 2021*

## Expected Action:
Using the binary 0.32.6 yields the following output when trying to init a directory.
``` console
~/Pr/H/infrastructure/lab/HomeAssistant main ❯ ~/Downloads/terragrunt_0.32.6 init              
WARN[0000] No double-slash (//) found in source URL /HomeLab-Infrastructure/terraform-proxied-vm.git. Relative paths in downloaded Terraform code may not work. 

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Reusing previous version of telmate/proxmox from the dependency lock file
- Reusing previous version of paultyng/unifi from the dependency lock file
- Reusing previous version of namecheap/namecheap from the dependency lock file
- Using previously-installed namecheap/namecheap v2.0.1
- Using previously-installed telmate/proxmox v2.8.0
- Using previously-installed paultyng/unifi v0.34.0

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```

## Result using newest binary
Now when changing nothing other than the new 0.34.0 binary yileds the following results. 
```console
~/Pr/H/infrastructure/lab/HomeAssistant main ❯ ~/Downloads/terragrunt_0.34.0 init
Error: Error in function call

  on /home/jhanafin/Projects/HomeLab-Infrastructure/infrastructure/global.hcl line 2, in locals:
   2:   namecheap_vars = yamldecode(sops_decrypt_file("${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/common_vars/namecheap_vars.sops.yaml"))

Call to function "sops_decrypt_file" failed: Failed to read
"/home/jhanafin/Projects/HomeLab-Infrastructure/infrastructure/lab/HomeAssistant/common_vars/namecheap_vars.sops.yaml": open
/home/jhanafin/Projects/HomeLab-Infrastructure/infrastructure/lab/HomeAssistant/common_vars/namecheap_vars.sops.yaml: no such file or directory.

ERRO[0000] Encountered error while evaluating locals.   
ERRO[0000] runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference 
ERRO[0000] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1 
```
It would appear ```get_parent_terragrunt_dir``` now grabs the childs directory not the root directory of the project. 

## Effected versions:
0.32.6: No
0.33.0: No
0.33.1: No
0.33.2: No
0.34.0: Yes

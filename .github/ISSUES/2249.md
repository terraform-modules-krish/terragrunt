# Before hooks doesn't run for dependencies

**Sorrowwill** commented *Aug 22, 2022*

Hello

We are keeping our state files locally in our repo and encrypt them using sops. This is part of our main terragrunt.hcl file:
```
terraform {
  before_hook "decrypt_states" {
    commands    = ["plan", "apply", "init", "import", "state", "destroy", "output"]
    execute     = ["bash", "-c", "find states/ -type f -name '*.tfstate' -execdir sops -d -i '{}' \\;"]
    working_dir = "${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}"
  }

  after_hook "encrypt_states" {
    commands     = ["plan", "apply", "init", "import", "state", "destroy", "output"]
    execute      = ["bash", "-c", "find states/ -type f -name '*.tfstate' -execdir sops -e -i '{}' \\;"]
    working_dir  = "${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}"
    run_on_error = true
  }
}
```

Unfortunately this setup doesn't seems to work with dependencies because hooks never called for terraform output from dependencies.

We have two modules: app and dns. DNS module depends on app:
```
dependency "app" {
  config_path = "../app"
}
```

In the dns module i get the following error on plan:
```
terragrunt plan
DEBU[0000] Running command: terraform output -json       prefix=[/<path_to_dependency>/app] 
╷
│ Error: Failed to load state: Unsupported state file format: The state file does not have a "version" attribute, which is required to identify the format version.
│ 
│ 
╵
ERRO[0000] exit status 1   
```

If i run terragrunt output from dependency it is working:
```
cd ../app
terragrunt output
$ terragrunt output
INFO[0000] Executing hook: decrypt_states                prefix=[/<path>/app] 
public_ip_addr = "<redacted_ip>"
INFO[0000] Executing hook: encrypt_states                prefix=[/<path>/app] 
```

Hi,
hooks definition is for `terraform` block so I think it shouldn't be executed when dependencies are evaluated, only when terraform invocation happens...

as a workaround, I was thinking to extract hooks definition in a common file and then including into dependencies

Thank you for your response.

I was able to successfully run your example and hooks were called for the app.

I tried to minimally reproduce our code and found out what hooks stop working when I add `remote_state` and `generate`
 blocks into common.hcl. I created an example that is similar to our current setup: <https://github.com/Sorrowwill/tg_repro>
 
 I'm not sure why this is happening and if this is a configuration error.

Hi,
in my run, it failed with
```
ERRO[0001] /projects/gruntwork/tests/tg_repro/prod/app/terragrunt.hcl:17,28-36: Unsupported attribute; This object does not have an attribute named "outputs". 
ERRO[0001] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1 
```
after adding mock outputs, it started to pass without errors
```
dependency "dep" {
  config_path = "../dep"
  mock_outputs_allowed_terraform_commands = ["plan"]
  mock_outputs = {
    var = "1"
  }
}
```

It's very strange, I am getting a totally different error in the freshly cloned repo:

```bash
root@work:~/projects/tg_repro# terraform --version
Terraform v1.2.7
on linux_amd64
root@work:~/projects/tg_repro# terragrunt --version
terragrunt version v0.38.7
root@work:~/projects/tg_repro# cd prod/app/
root@work:~/projects/tg_repro/prod/app# terragrunt apply
ERRO[0000] /root/projects/tg_repro/prod/dep/terragrunt.hcl is a dependency of /root/projects/tg_repro/prod/app/terragrunt.hcl but detected no outputs. Either the target module has not been applied yet, or the module has no outputs. If this is expected, set the skip_outputs flag to true on the dependency block. 
ERRO[0000] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1 
```

And this is happening because hooks are not called and state for dep module is not at expected path.

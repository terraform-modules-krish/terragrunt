hi, i am new to terragrunt and encountering a problem when try to plan-all. 
I am using terraform v.0.12.28 and terragrunt v0.23.10. 
my root terragrunt.hcl:

and the problem i am encountering when trying to terragrunt plan-all:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58950564/88177825-233f3f00-cc32-11ea-982d-384c223b7f5a.png)

i have tried to change the file location to to c:// , but it still gave this error.
if i am using terraform to deploy each folder, it works. 

i cannot find any similar problem with terragrunt over the internet. 
does anyone encountered this too?

Does it work if you switch `/` to `\` in the path?:
```
"${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}\\terraform.tfvars"
```

Eliasi could you remove your cache directory and after that let's try again!

Didn't work for me either, I switched to `required_var_files = ["${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/common.tfvars"]` instead of arguments and that worked great.

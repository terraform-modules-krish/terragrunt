# Need new get_aws_account_aliases() built-in function

**dod38fr** commented *Mar 10, 2023*

Hello

I'm using terragrunt in a company where the account alias is used to create the name of the tfstate bucket.

Currently, we are running an external `aws` command to list the accounts alias from `terragrunt.hcl`, but this is brittle.

To be able to get rid of this brittle code, I need a way to get the list of aliases with a builtin function. 

Could you add a new function similar to `get_aws_account_id` to get the list of account aliases ?

All the best
<br />

Note that an account can only have one alias at a time (see [doc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-alias.html)). So I guess that the new function could be named `get_aws_account_alias` even if the underlying SDK function is named [ListAccountAliases](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/iam#Client.ListAccountAliases)

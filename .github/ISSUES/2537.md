# add option to use system tflint instead of the embedded one

**juljaeg** commented *Apr 19, 2023*

We like to have consistent tflint versions for dedicated tflint calls and the indirect calls over terragrunt. The current behaviour always uses the embedded tflint version. I would like to propose to add a flag to not use the embedded version and instead just use the installed one.

My current workaround is to to a `run_cmd("--terragrunt-quiet", "which", "tflint")` so that the condition does not evaluate to `tflint`. Unfortunately this does not pass the inputs and var files then.

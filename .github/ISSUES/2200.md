# Add Azure support for remote_state auto initialization

**markusbecker** commented *Jul 18, 2022*

Hi,
currently AWS and GCP are supported as part of the auto init feature of the terragrunt remote_state. 

> The following backends are currently supported by remote_state:
[s3 backend](https://www.terraform.io/language/settings/backends/s3)
[gcs backend](https://www.terraform.io/language/settings/backends/gcs)
For all other backends, the remote_state block operates in the same manner as generate.

[Terraform - Keep your remote state configuration dry](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/keep-your-remote-state-configuration-dry/)

Is there any plan to add Azure as well? (that would cover the creation of Azure Resource group, Azure Storage Account and Azure Blob Container)
<br />

There is an open pull request for this (#1736) that unfortunately appears to have been abandoned.

Interested in this one as well. It looks like the PR is abandoned?

I'm also interested in the Azure backend. Any news on this? Thanks ðŸ™‡

This might also help with problems when the remote_backend file is renamed and terragrunt refuses to update the backend generated file before you run terraform init which of course requires the new file.

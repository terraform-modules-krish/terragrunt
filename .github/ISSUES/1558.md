# Multiple dependencies at a higher level

**gayanhewa** commented *Feb 23, 2021*

I am running into an issue where terragrunt is complaining with a wrong path for my dependencies.

```
 - sgs
 - vpc
 - services
     terragrunt.hcl (1)
     - service-a
        - terragrunt.hcl (2)
```

The code in the terragrun.hcl (1) 

```
dependency "sgs" {
  config_path = "../sgs"
}

dependency "vpc" {
  config_path = "../vpc"
}

inputs = {
  v1 = dependency.sgs.outputs.v1
  v2 = dependency.sgs.outputs.v2
}

```

Every time, the 2nd dependency resolves to a wrong path. I am running `terragrunt plan`` from within the directory `service-a` and terragrunt tries to look for the 2nd dependency inside that directory. ie. services/vpc/terragrunt.hcl`

If I move the two dependencies around like below, the 2nd depdency gets that error. With one dependency this seems to work fine.

```
dependency "vpc" {
  config_path = "../vpc"
}

dependency "sgs" {
  config_path = "../sgs"
}

inputs = {
  v1 = dependency.sgs.outputs.v1
  v2 = dependency.sgs.outputs.v2
}

```

Could you share the full log output, including what command you're running, and in which folder?

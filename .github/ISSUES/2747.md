With terraform 1.6.0, terragrunt (0.52.0, edit: 0.52.1 as well) init fails with this message:

> -10-06T09:08:57Z level=error msg=Unable to parse Terraform version output (on a GitHub runner) [command]/home/runner/work/_temp/99eb66ee-b605-4d22-9ab8-d97d2c74e871/terraform-bin --version
Terraform v1.6.0
on linux_amd64

It seems to be failing with terraform 1.5.7 as well.

Can't confirm on MacOSX (M1), @ognjengrubac-tomtom . For me, terragrunt 0.52.1 works with terraform 1.5.7

1.6.0 added support for Terraform "projects" Would it be possible to add support for this in Terragrunt?
 https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/cloud/settings#project
Currently, we generate a backend like below and the pipeline runs without error but the project isn't applied to the workspace in Terraform Cloud and shows up as just "Default Project"

```
generate "backend" {
  path      = "backend.tf"
  if_exists = "skip"
  contents  = <<EOF
terraform {
  cloud {
    hostname     = "app.terraform.io"
    organization = "XXXXXX"
    workspaces {
      name = "azure-${local.tenant}-${local.region_abbr}-${local.subscription}-${local.application}-${replace(path_relative_to_include(), "/", "-")}"
      project = "Test"
    }
  } 
} 
EOF
} 
```

terrgrunt init works with tg 0.52.1 and tf 1.6.1 on Mac M1, but not on linux_amd64 (GitHub worker)

I just got this error in Github Actions using `hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2`. When setting `terraform_wrapper: false` the error go's away. 
So my guess is that somehow the [wrapper](https://github.com/hashicorp/setup-terraform/tree/main/wrapper) is messing something up.

terragrunt init works after upgrading version to 0.52.3 with terraform v1.6.1 on Ubuntu 22.04.

@MaoChhaya I cannot confirm. For GH runner with this setup
<img width="262" alt="image" src="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/assets/837437/c846fa69-ffea-4abc-b94a-75d2649257a1">
it still fails.

However I'm not setting `terraform_wrapper: false` as indicated by @boekkooi-lengoo ... I'd expect it to work either way.

Update: It does work with setting `terraform_wrapper: false` for `hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2` action. Still not sure I want to add that config in all our repos... especially as sometimes we do use a feature of the wrapper which makes stdout available as step output for later GH workflow steps.

Not all Terragrunt tests are passing with Terraform 1.6, so far found issue https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/34066 which sometimes appear on projects

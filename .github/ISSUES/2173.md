# Working dir is not cached when Terragrunt source is a hidden directory, even using `include_in_copy`

**lorengordon** commented *Jun 29, 2022*

Consider the directory structure:

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .ci
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ iam
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.tf
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ terragrunt.hcl
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ terragrunt.hcl
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ modules
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ iam-policies
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.tf
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ outputs.tf
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ variables.tf
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ versions.tf
```

Contents of `.ci/iam/terragrunt.hcl`:
```
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

terraform {
  source = "${path_relative_from_include()}/..//.ci/${path_relative_to_include()}"
}
```

And using a relative path in `.ci/iam/main.tf`:

```
module "iam_policies" {
  source = "../../modules/iam-policies"

  policies = local.policies
}
```

That relative path _should_ work, due to the positioning of the `//` in the source in the terragrunt.hcl config.

However, instead we get `ERRO[0000] Working dir .ci/iam from source file:///home/loren/git/repos/flow-ci does not exist`. Here is the full debug logs:

```

I've also tried various forms of `include_in_copy`, but none work...

```
include_in_copy = ["**/.ci/iam"]
include_in_copy = ["**/.ci/iam/**"]
include_in_copy = ["**/.ci/**"]
include_in_copy = ["../../.ci/**"]
include_in_copy = ["../../.ci/iam"]
include_in_copy = ["../../.ci/iam/**"]
include_in_copy = ["**"]
include_in_copy = ["/**"]
include_in_copy = ["**/**"]
include_in_copy = ["**/iam"]
```

Perhaps I'm missing something obvious in how to specify `include_in_copy`?

If not, my suspicion is that the hidden directory is being excluded due to the "default" terragrunt rules _before_ `include_in_copy` is being processed? I'm not really sure.

I think one potential solution is that terragrunt should _always_ include the directory that is specified as the source in terragrunt.hcl, even when it is a hidden directory.

Edit: I am using terragrunt v0.38.2...

```
‚ùØ terragrunt --version
terragrunt version v0.38.2
```

To demonstrate that the general setup is otherwise correct, just renaming the `.ci` directory to `_ci` does get this working. But I'd much rather use a hidden directory for this particular setup.

Hi,
tried to use `include_in_copy = [".ci/iam"]` ?

I did this in a test project https://github.com/denis256/terragrunt-tests/blob/master/issue-2173/.ci/iam/terragrunt.hcl#L7 and it seems to copy `.ci` directory

No, that doesn't actually seem to work.

```
ERRO[0000] Working dir .ci/iam from source file:///home/loren/git/repos/flow-ci does not exist
ERRO[0000] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1
```

```
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

terraform {
  source = "${path_relative_from_include()}/..//.ci/${path_relative_to_include()}"
  include_in_copy = [".ci/iam"]
}
```

Same thing if I use your reproduction test case:

```
ERRO[0000] Working dir .ci/iam from source file:///home/loren/git/repos/terragrunt-tests/issue-2173 does not exist
ERRO[0000] Unable to determine underlying exit code, so Terragrunt will exit with error code 1
```

Ok, so I still had the older terragrunt version where include_in_copy doesn't work on directories. Updating to 0.38.3 and it _does_ work in your reproduction test case.

However, we're using some hooks in the .ci/terragrunt.hcl because we don't need the lock file in our environment and it just gets in the way. So try this in `.ci/terragrunt.hcl`:

```
terraform {
  before_hook "terraform_lock" {
    commands = ["init"]
    execute  = ["rm", "-f", ".terraform.lock.hcl"]
  }

  after_hook "terraform_lock" {
    commands = concat(get_terraform_commands_that_need_locking(), ["init"])
    execute  = ["rm", "-f", "${get_terragrunt_dir()}/.terraform.lock.hcl"]
  }
}
```

Weirdly, if I move the hooks into `.ci/iam/terragrunt.hcl`, then it works fine. What is even happening ü§Ø?

Hi,
I think `merge_strategy` should be updated to `deep` for included HCL file to merge all fields:

```
# .ci/iam/terragrunt.hcl

include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
  merge_strategy = "deep"
}

terraform {
  source = "${path_relative_from_include()}/..//.ci/${path_relative_to_include()}"
  include_in_copy = [".ci/iam"]

}

# .ci/terragrunt.hcl

terraform {
  before_hook "terraform_lock" {
    commands = ["init"]
    execute  = ["rm", "-f", ".terraform.lock.hcl"]
  }

  after_hook "terraform_lock" {
    commands = concat(get_terraform_commands_that_need_locking(), ["init"])
    execute  = ["rm", "-f", "${get_terragrunt_dir()}/.terraform.lock.hcl"]
  }
}

```

In my case, it started to copy hidden files and not crash with errors

That worked, yes! Thanks so much @denis256!

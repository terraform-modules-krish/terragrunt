# Make it possible to apply a specific plan file

**geekifier** commented *Mar 29, 2018*

It is often useful to be able to generate a plan file using the `-out planfile.tfplan` option passed to Terraform, and then have the subsequent `terraform apply` use the same plan file as input.

This works fine in vanilla Terraform, however it breaks when using Terragrunt:

```bash
$ terragrunt plan -out tgf.plan

[terragrunt] 2018/03/29 12:59:16 Running command: terraform plan -var-file=/platform/dev/us-east-1/playground_module/../../account.tfvars -out tgf.plan
Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
persisted to local or remote state storage.

null_resource.resource_1: Refreshing state... (ID: 5541669811424217406)

No changes. Infrastructure is up-to-date.

This means that Terraform did not detect any differences between your
configuration and real physical resources that exist. As a result, no
actions need to be performed.
```
```bash
$ terragrunt apply tgf.plan

You can't set variables with the '-var' or '-var-file' flag
when you're applying a plan file. The variables used when
the plan was created will be used. If you wish to use different
variable values, create a new plan file.

```

If this is not currently supported, I would like to know if it's feasible to implement this feature based on how Terragrunt works with Terraform?

I think that's the real cause of the issue. Do you have an `extra_args` block for `apply` that adds `account.tfvars`?

Well, that's embarrassing :). I do indeed have the extra_args block, as I wanted to propagate certain "global" root-level variables down to all modules.

Looks like I could just replace `${get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars()}` interpolation with the list of actual commands (other than `apply`).

But then of course this will break running a direct `apply` without a plan being passed in.
I guess that I am OK with that, because it actually forces a certain workflow to occur.

Hello.
I'm having the same issue but with 'apply-all' scenario.
I made the similar workaround with 
```
extra_arguments "common_vars" {
    # do not use `get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars()` here
    # as there is an issue with `apply-all` command
    # https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/493
    # https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/457
    commands = [
      "plan"
    ]
```
in root terragrunt.hcl file

@geekifier [Here](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/493#issuecomment-452086522) it's said that for `apply` command there is a way to make it working.

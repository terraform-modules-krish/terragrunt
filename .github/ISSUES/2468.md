# Terragrunt run-all destroy attempts to delete "dependent" configurations outside the folder on which the destroy is occuring.

**kansberry-kr** commented *Feb 24, 2023*

If I have a folder structure as follows:

root--------folder1
         |------folder2------folder3
         | -----folder5        |-----folder4

And I run a run-all destroy against folder2, I would expect the configuration state files to be removed for folder2, folder3 and folder4, as 3 and 4 are nest under folder2. I would not expect folder1 to be deleted if HCL files in any of the 3 folders being deleted depend upon the output of folder1's configuration, but Terragrunt run-all -destroy does this today. Can the code be modified so that only the parent folder on which the "destroy" is being run and any of its children be deleted, but not any dependent Terraform configurations?

Hi,
will be helpful to provide an example where this issue happens - from the provided structure it is not clear which dependencies are used where

If root contains folder1 and folder2 and I do a run-all with a destroy flag against folder2, folder1 will be destroyed if any HCL files in folder2 have a dependency on folder1. In other words, I am trying to confine the destroy of folder2. If there are HCL files within folder2 that have dependencies outside of folder2, I DO NOT want those dependent state files to be destroyed.

My previous two post are not correct. I am still learning Terragrunt, so it difficult to articulate what I am attempting to say, but I think I have a better way of phrasing this now. I believe when you do a "run-all" against a "parent" HCL file, it will run and create state for the module associated with this file AND any HCL file dependent upon this "parent" HCL file. Is that correct?

If so, when I execute "run-all" with the "destroy" flag against the same "parent" HCL file, I want the Terraform state of that file and all dependent HCL files destroyed, BUT NOT the Terraform state files of HCL file on which the "parent" HCL file is dependent. In other words, I would like to stop destroying when I reach the "parent" HCL file and NOT continue "destroying" up the dependency tree to HCL files on which the "parent" file is dependent. Does this make more sense?

If this is possible, I believe PR [#2445](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/2445) must be completed first.

Sorry for any confusion I caused and thanks for your time.

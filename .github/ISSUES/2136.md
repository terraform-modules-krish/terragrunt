# Missing binaries in release

**woidda** commented *Jun 8, 2022*

It seems that with the `v0.37.2` the binaries where not generated for download.
e.g. [v0.37.2 terragrunt_linux_amd64](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/download/v0.37.2/terragrunt_linux_amd64)
returns a 404 vs [v0.37.1 terragrunt_linux_amd64](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/download/v0.37.1/terragrunt_linux_amd64)

This breaks the [action-terragrunt](https://github.com/autero1/action-terragrunt) - when using the `latest` option as is usually a good idea.

Ah, seems that the release was not done yet. Hmmm

Ah yup there is a ~10 min delay between release cutting and binaries being uploaded.
